               are still chatting as Mr. Garrison enters.]

                         Okay, children, let's take our seats. 
                         Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?

                         Okay, let's all take out our math homework 
                         and go over the problems.

                          Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where 
                         did I file that?

                          Oh, and by the way, children, there's 
                         a walkout scheduled today to protest 
                         the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against 
                         the war, run along outside, and if you're 
                         for the war, uh, stay here and we'll 
                         do math problems.

                         How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so 
                         long ago. I wonder what life would have 
                         been like back then?  Back then? Back 
                         then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, 
                         I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, 
                         I don't even care about 1776. It was 
                         so long ago, that I don't think it has 
                         anything to do with me.  With me. With... 
                         anything to do with me. With me.

                          Very well. Take this document to the 
                         Continental Congress.

                         Yeah, because you don't care about the 
                         fate of the Colonies like we do! You're 
                         all unpatriotic! And if you don't like 
                         the Colonies, then you can git out!

                         protesting this war because we care 
                         so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! 
                         You are all unpatriotic for leading 
                         the Colonies into a war that half of 
                         them don't want!

                         Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on

                         I believe that if we are to form a new 
                         country, we cannot be a country that 
                         appears war-hungry and violent to the 
                         rest of the world. However, we also 
                         cannot be a country that appears weak 
                         and unwilling to fight to the rest of 
                         the world. So, what if we form a country 
                         that appears to want both?
 
                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and 
                         protest going to war at the same time.
 
                         
                                     DICKINSON
                         Right. If the people of our new country 
                         are allowed to do whatever they wish, 
                         then some will support the war and some 
                         will protest it.
 
                                     FRANKLIN
                         And that means that as a nation, we 
                         could go to war with whomever we wished, 
                         but at the same time, act like we didn't 
                         want to. If we allow the people to protest 
                         what the government does, then the country 
                         will be forever blameless.

                         I learned somethin' today. This country 
                         was founded by some of the smartest 
                         thinkers the world has ever seen. And 
                         they knew one thing: that a truely great 
                         country can go to war, and at the same 
                         time, act like it doesn't want to.  
                         You people who are for the war, you 
                         need the protesters. Because they make 
                         the country look like it's made of sane, 
                         caring individuals. And you people who 
                         are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, 
                         because, if our whole country was made 
                         up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, 
                         we'd get taken down in a second. That's 
                         why the founding fathers decided we 
                         should have both. It's called "having 
                         your cake and eating it too."

                         is the ability to do one thing and say 
                         another.
