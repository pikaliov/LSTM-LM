                         Uh, there's been a terrible flood in 
                         Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's 
                         event is being moved to Arkansas.

                         Somebody's gonna have to fill in for

                         I haven't seen my father for 23 years.

                         Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know 
                         this is very difficult, m'kay, but I 
                         must ask: is there a history of sexual 
                         abuse in your family?
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         ...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. 
                         He... he molested me.

                         M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested 
                         you when you were a boy?  Mr. Garrison, 
                         I think, when we get to Arkansas, you 
                         need to see your father. You need to 
                         face this demon in your closet, m'kay?

                         bastard trip and just- don't look at 
                         me!

                         It depends, uh- how big a gun are we

                         I think if someone said, "Have sex with

                         Yeah.

                         Yeah, a knife.

                         If a killer put a knife to my throat, 
                         and said, "Have sex with your father 
                         or else I'm gonna kill your mother while

                         That's right.

                                     PATRON 3
                         Uh huh.

                         That makes sense.

                         Mm-hm.

                         Huhuh, good- good-bye. 

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         M-m-m.  Oh, well, thank you!  You know, 
                         it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. 
                          Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly 
                         has been a great trip. Let's head home.
 
                         
                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Which way should we go?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Second star to the right, and straight 
                         on 'til morning.
