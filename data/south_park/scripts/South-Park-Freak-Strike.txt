                         You see?  There she goes. There she 
                         goes.  OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!

                         What the hell is this? 

                                     ELEPHANT MAN
                         A lot of decent hard-working freaks 
                         in America are losing their talk-show 
                         jobs to freaks of a different nature. 
                         Sure, everyone in this great country 
                         of hours is a freak, but true, physically 
                         deformed freaks must be recognized, 
                         for it's these real freaks that make 
                         you all feel better about yourselves 
                         for not being one. So next time you're 
                         watching television, make sure it's 
                         a show with "freak" freaks, and not 
                         just with people that are freaks because 
                         they're stupid trailer trash from the 
                         South. That's what we mean when we say, 
                         "Look for the True Freak label" 
 
               [four freaks join in] When you are watching a TV talk show

               [a side shot of more freaks streaming their way to the box] Remember 
               somewhere,
 
               [a shot of the audience] our union's growing

               [a front shot of the freaks walking in] Our wages going to feed 
               the kids.
 
               [a front shot of more freaks walking in] And run the house-
 
               
               We work hard, but who's complaining?

               [a zoom-out shot as the freaks crowd in around Butters] With 
               TFU we're making our way!
 
               [a pan shot] So always look for the True Freak label,

               [a full crowd shot] Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.! 
               [the Maury Povich logo is restored]
 
                                     MAURY
                         Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, 
                         heh. Anyway-
 
                                     MAN
                         They're right. We should have never 
                         crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. 
                         
 
                                     MAURY
                          Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can 
                         make the other out-of-control kids take... 
                         their clothes off, too!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Whatevah! I'll crap in my... pants! 
                         
 
                                     CAMERAMAN
                         Sir, the ratings have just started to 
                         plummet.
 
                                     MAURY
                         Ah, those damned freaks! 

               [Outside the Maury Povich studio. A door opens and Maury steps 
               out. The freaks stop and wait]
 
                                     MAURY
                         I gave you shoes! And groceries! And 
                         this is how you repay me?!  Very well. 
                         Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! 
                         
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can 
                         get back home. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Butters, you have screwed me out of 
                         a prize for the last time! 
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh. Double hamburgers.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Aaahh! 

                                     BUTTERS
                         Hey. Things actually turned out... okay 
                         for me this time. 
 
                                     CHRIS
                          Butters!

                                     BUTTERS
                          Oh I know.

               THE END
