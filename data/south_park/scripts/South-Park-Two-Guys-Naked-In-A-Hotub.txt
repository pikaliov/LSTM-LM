               [The Marsh car, night, Randy's driving. He and Sheila take Stan 
               along with them. It seems Shelley has already been dropped off 
               at Cartman's house to babysit him.]

                         time.

                         No, you guys are gonna have a great 
                         time! Whenever there's a party, the 
                         adults get to hang out and have fun 
                         while the kids spend the night locked 
                         in the basement eating stale pretzels.

                         Well, your mom and I don't get out much, 
                         so you'll just have to bear through 
                         it.

               one of them double-parked. The house is festooned with stars 
               of various sizes, with two shooting stars among them. A banner 
               reads, "METEOR SHOWER PARTY" while a sign on the door reads "WELCOME 
               SKYWATCHERS." The Marshes reach the door and Randy rings the 
               bell. Mr. Mackey answers.]

                         out very big guns and started shooting 
                         everyone. The ATF had no choice but

                         Hey, uhour parents aren't religious 
                         fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them 
                         that they're makin' an awful mistake, 
                         don't we?

                         Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we 
                         have a new mission.

                          Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. 
                         Talk. Talk, damn you.

                         I'm just having a hard time with what 
                         we did in the hot tub.

                         So, so now we can't be friends?

                                     RANDY
                         I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, 
                         I... I just feel so strange. I know it's 
                         ridiculous, but I can't help feeling 
                         like people here know. You know? Like, 
                         even though nobody could know, 'cause 
                         we said we'd never tell anybody.

                          Well, of course we wouldn't.

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Oh, uh I didn't realize that.

                         you?

                          Well, of course! I thought it would 
                         be implied! When you masturbate with 
                         another guy in a hot tub, you assume 
                         that nobody is gonna tell anybody!

                         you've never yelled at me before.

                         if you don't get outside right now, 
                         and tell those army guys you're not

                         gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell

                         out.  Nobody can stand this much Cher.

                         We have not had any cooperation with 
                         the cult inside the house. They are 
                         refusing to come out, and apparently 
                         they still plan to commit mass suicide 
                         once the meteor shower starts, which 
                         should be any moment now.

                          Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all

                                     RANDY
                         Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!

                         So we're friends again?

                          Hold on just a minute! This is Derek 
                         Smalls reporting. We have just received 
                         an exclusive video from inside the house 
                         , proving that the people inside are 
                         not cultists after all.

                          Uh oh.  Uh uh attention everyone! This 
                         has only been a test. Good job, men, 
                         on this, uh, simulation.

                         Sir, this isn't gonna look good.

                                     GANZ
                         You're right. Quick, let's get out of 
                         here!

                         Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, 
                         boys.

                         Wow, you mean that?

                                     DEREK
                         Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able 
                         to make millions and further my career 
                         beyond my wildest dreams.

                         There. Angels, I must say I think we 
                         did a smashing job.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the 
                         fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, 
                         I can tell ya.

                         But you know, I learned something today. 
                         I used to call you guys Melvins. But 
                         you're just kids, like me. We separate 
                         you in school because you talk different 
                         and you study too hard, but we've proven 
                         tonight that we can all get along.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, 
                         Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                          Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would 
                         not believe the night I had.
 
                                     STAN
                         You?! You think you had a bad night?! 
                         I had to hang out all night with these 
                         friggin' Melvins!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Hoh, dude, weak.

                                     STAN
                         Super weak.

                                     KYLE
                         Come on. I'll tell you all about what 
                         happened to me.
