               are rowdy.]
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Settle down, children. I have some 
                         difficult news. This is going to make 
                         you all very sad.  The school board 
                         is considering firing me as your teacher. 
                         There's a possibility that I will be 
                         let go and never allowed to teach you 
                         again.  Yes, Stanley?
 
                                     STAN
                         That's okay with us.

                         Yeah, we don't care.

                         Yeah, that's fine.

                         No it isn't it makes you very sad. Now, 
                         apparently, the school board thinks 
                         that I don't teach you anything about 
                         current events, so tomorrow they're 
                         going to have you do presentations for 
                         the whole board.

                         or better yet, watch television, and 
                         come up with something current in South

                         I'm going to place you all into groups 
                         of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe,

                         There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I 
                         bet he'll do a great job in your group.

                         That's what Chad Everett thought when 
                         the new female intern joined the cast 
                         of Medical Center. He thought. "Who 
                         is this woman with her gazungas and 
                         high heels? What does she know about 
                         medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved 
                         Chad Everett's brother with a kidney 
                         transplant. So, you see?

                         Well, let me put it another way. You 
                         have to give your oral report to the 
                         entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow! 
                         And if it doesn't kick ass, and you 
                         make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack

                         I'm actually interested in something 
                         else. I'm John Postem from the Harbucks 
                         Coffee CorporationÂ…

                         been calling.

                         me back? All we wanna do is buy out 
                         your coffee shop here.

                         Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop 
                         is worth a lot to me.
 
                                     POSTEM
                         Well all right.  How about $500,000?
 
                         
                                     MR. TWEEK
                         The answer is still no, Mr. Postem. 
                         You see, when my father opened this 
                         store 30 yars ago, he cared about only 
                         one thing: making a great cup of coffee. 
                          Sure, we may take a little longer to 
                         brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy 
                         names, but I guess we just care a little 
                         more.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is 
                         still home-brewed from the finest beans 
                         we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is 
                         a simpler cup, for a simpler America.
 
                         
                                     POSTEM
                         Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna 
                         have to open our Harbucks right next 
                         door to you.

                         Some things are more important than 
                         money.  The people of South Park count 
                         on you to give them that first cup of 
                         coffee every day.

                         I know, but if they open a Harbucks 
                         right next door, we might go out of 
                         business. They really have my balls

                         All right. And now, before we all vote 
                         yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why 
                         are the lovable, innocent children.

                         Uh. Since we are so concerned with the 
                         corporate takeovers, we went and asked 
                         our friends, the underpants gnomes, 
                         and they told us all about big corporations.

                         What?

                         Good? 

                                     KYLE
                         Because without big corporations we 
                         wouldn't have things like cars and computers 
                         and canned soup.

                         Even Harbucks Coffee started off as 
                         a small, little business. But because 
                         it made such great coffee, and because 
                         they ran their business so well, they 
                         managed to grow and grow until it became 
                         the corporate powerhouse it is today. 
                         And that is why we should all let Harbucks 
                         stay!

                         write that paper last time.

                         These boys are absolutely right. We've 
                         been using these poor kids to pull at 
                         your heartstrings for our cause, and 
                         it's wrong. We're as low and despicable 
                         as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and 
                         complaining, but did any of you ever 
                         even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? 
                          Harbucks coffee got to where it is 
                         by being the best. Don't you think you 
                         should at least try it?

                         Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, 
                         sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has.

                          Hey. Hey, that is good.

                         It's a French roast.

                         It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that 
                         first splash of sun on an April morning. 
                         This coffee is coffee the way it should 
                         be.
 
                                     POSTEM
                         Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You 
                         know, we still need someone to run this 
                         Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will 
                         make a lo-o-ot of money.
 
                                     MR. TWEEK
                         Thank you, Mr. Postem, but I think we'll 
                         be happy with the money we make selling 
                         our son into slavery.

                         Just kidding, son.

                         I love you guys.
