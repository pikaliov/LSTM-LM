                                     ANNOUNCER
                         And now back to Huntin' and Killin' 
                         with South Park's favorite hunters, 
                         Jimbo and Ned. 
 
                                     JIMBO
                         Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is 
                         Ned. Say 'Hi', Ned.
 
                                     NED
                         M-hi, Ned.

                                     JIMBO
                          Now, idn't that great?  We have a terrific 
                         show for you today: we're gonna kill 
                         some elk, and we're gonna kill some 
                         mountain goats. Now, the new law passed 
                         by Colorado legislature, which Ned and 
                         I call 'Pussy Law #4', states that we 
                         can no longer kill animals in defense.
 
                         
               "PUSSY LAW #4"

               NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,

               EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS

               SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS

               IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY

               BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE

               PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE

               BODILY HARM.

               In other words, our old line of 'It's comin' right for us'-
 
               
                                     NED
                         It's comin' right for us.

                                     JIMBO
                         -no longer works. So now, we only kill 
                         naimals to, quote, thin out their numbers. 
                         If we don't hunt, then these animals 
                         will grow too big in number and they 
                         won't have enough food. So you see, 
                         we have to kill animals, or else they'll 
                         DIE.  Uuh. So, roll the tape.  Here 
                         we are at Shafer's Crossing lookin' 
                         for some animals.
 
                                     JIMBO
                         Looky, Ned, there are some deer!  Quick, 
                         Ned. Thin out their numbers!
 
                                     NED
                         Thin out their numbers! 

                                     JIMBO
                         Good work, Ned. Now, they won't starve.
 
                         
                                     JIMBO
                         That sure was a great hunting trip. 
                         We saved those deer from extinction.

                         Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some 
                         napalm on an unsuspecting family of 
                         beavers. And also, try to thin out the 
                         numbers of some endangered species.

                         What's Vietnam? A question a child might 
                         ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. 
                         Children, for the next few days, we'll 
                         be learning all about Vietnam. Chances 
                         are that somebody in your own lives 
                         was affected by this incredible war.

                         That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam 
                         War was sticky and icky.

               Mysteries

               of the

               Unexplained

               [the letters are wavy and uneven. The boys come to see the taping] 
               One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film 
               of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern 
               Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of 
               Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. 
               If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they 
               can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that 
               frog may very well exist. [it plays. Shown is a snowy field, 
               with the camera looking from behind some blades of grass] Now 
               watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog. [nothing 
               seems to be happening] There! There, did you see it? Roll that 
               back again! [the film is replayed] Now, freeze it! [the film 
               is frozen, and there's an object flying through the air.] Well, 
               I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What 
               do you think, Ned?

                         Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys 
                         we know who were there.

                         like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana 
                         fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' 
                         shards of broken glass up your ass and 
                         then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce

                         Yes, now we're about to roll the film, 
                         but remember: if you look the Mexican 
                         staring frog in the eyes, you could 
                         go catatonic. We don't know if this 
                         applies to pictures of the frog or not, 
                         but who wants to take chances? So when 
                         we roll this film, be sure to look away. 
                          Okay, roll the film, Tom.  Is it over?

               Okay, it's over. [they lower their arms and sit up] Well, there 
               you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of 
               Southern Sri Lanka exists. And you saw it here, on the Jimbo 
               and Ned show.

                         uh "skeptics" thought that the film 
                         we showed of the Mexican staring frog 
                         of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That 
                         you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, 
                         it just so happens that we just received 
                         another film from another anonymous 
                         viewer.  Roll it.  There you go. Proof 
                         that not only is this frog real, but 
                         it is doing harm to the people of South 
                         Park as we speak.

                         Unless we can prove to the world that 
                         the whole thing is a sham. If we prove 
                         that the Mexican staring frog of Southern 
                         Sri Lanka is just something- mmade up 
                         by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken 
                         off the air, perhaps even killed!

                         roller coaster, but all we ever wanted 
                         was a log ride. We waited and we waited, 
                         but they never built us one. I think- 
                         Danforth wanted the log ride more than 
                         anybody, but he he had to settle with 
                         that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.

                         using this incendiary device  while 
                         Ned will ambush him from the rear.  
                         Now, Ned. He's not lookin'.  Quick, 
                         Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, 
                         Ned!  Ned? Ne-ed.  Oh, no!  Come on,

                         Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed 
                         Jimbo about it and he made up all this 
                         stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in

                         I guess not.

                         And as for you, Stan uh, I think you 
                         need to kick your drug habit pretty 
                         soon.

                         No. Your producer did.  She made Jimbo 
                         tell everybody that I did drugs.

                         over, and told Jimbo what to say about 
                         me. She told him to lie!

                         It's true. She did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
