                         heard, the President has asked that 
                         American children all send one dollar 
                         to the children of Afghanistan.  So 
                         I have a list of addresses and we're 
                         goin' to all chip in.

                         not with Afghanistan, and the only reason 
                         that you care is that you don't wanna 
                         give up the dollar!

                         get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now 
                         look, it isn't our fault that terrorists 
                         hate us. We're just kids. We're not 
                         the ones bombing them now, we're- we're 
                         jsut kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff 
                         goin' on in the world, but, we're caught 
                         in the middle. It's not our fault.

               [Afghanistan, day. Adults mill around as fighter planes fly by 
               and bomb a few buildings. Two boys enter from the left and face 
               the camera. They begin to talk in a strange language. Two other 
               boys appear, and it's apparent these boys are the counterparts 
               to the boys in South Park. The one who looks overdressed has 
               a goat. After what sounds like introductions, they move off to 
               play some basketball at a nearby makeshift ball court. The boy 
               who was the first to speak gives the ball to his friend, the 
               second to speak. The friend shoots the basket, but a bomb falls 
               on the backboard, launching the ball away from the court and 
               destroying the backboard and pole]

                         Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys 
                         should know one thing.  Most people 
                         in America are good people. We just 
                         try to live day by day, like you guys 
                         do. Maybe if you took some time to see 
                         all the great things about our country, 
                         you'd see... we're not so different 
                         after all.

                         That's fine. But we still hate you.

                         we can learn to... hate you too.

                          Dude! I almost thought those Afghani

                         No, dude. America may have some problems, 
                         but it's our home. Our team. And if 
                         you don't wanna root for your team, 
                         then you should get the hell out of 
                         the stadium.
