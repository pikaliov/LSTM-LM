                          City kids get to go to museums for 
                         field trips. We get cow farms.

                         Now, out here you can see our cattle. 
                         This is where the magic begins as the 
                         cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain 
                         death.

                          Now here we have the slaughterhouse. 
                         This is where we turn the cows into 
                         steaks and burgers.

                         our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal 
                         the whole key is keepin' the cows chained 
                         so they can't walk around or get any 
                         exercise. That way, their muscle tissue 
                         stays soft, and makes for tender veal.

                         Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know 
                         how you raise your kids, but my son 
                         does not play negotiator with me!

                         We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't 
                         that simple!

                         HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle 
                         and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?! 
                          This is your mother! You will open 
                         this door right now!

                          Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.  
                         That was very impressive.

                          Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, 
                         I'm going to be very angry!

                         Well you made me eat veal and didn't 
                         tell me what it was. So go ahead and 
                         be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!

                         come to this.

                         Well that's fine! You boys can just 
                         stay in there and starve to death. Us 
                         parents are going to go to Pizza Shack 
                         and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.

                         You'll have to come out sooner or later, 
                         boys. The longer you wait, the more 
                         trouble you'll be in.

                         douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand 
                         here until we starve?!

                         Our parents would never let us starve. 
                         They're bluffing. This is a battle of 
                         wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll 
                         give in.

                         Three of us can sleep while one keeps 
                         watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.

                         be getting so hungry. Maybe we should 
                         get them a little food.

                         We need our boys to know that we're 
                         not gonna cave in, at all.

                         roads!

                         Captain, we cannot keep going fast on 
                         these icy roads.

                         Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed 
                         to forty-five and maintain distance 
                         from those police cruisers.

                         "veal" was officially changed to "little 
                         tortured baby cow" the market has gone 
                         dry. Seems that people see "little tortured 
                         baby cow" on their menus, they don't 
                         feel like orderin'.

                         He's very luck you got him here when 
                         you did. He was in a very advanced state 
                         of vaginitis.

                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         It occurs when a person stops eating 
                         meat. Those sores on his skin were actually 
                         small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped 
                         it in time, Stan would have eventually 
                         just become one great big giant pussy.

                         Well, I guess we learned somethng today: 
                         it's wrong to eat veal because the animals 
                         are so horribly mistreated, but if you 
                         don't eat meat at all you break out 
                         in vaginas.

                         parents. And you need to learn that 
                         terrorism is never the answer.

                         to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we 
                         can grab some burgers.
