               Ethiopians laze about in front of their huts, having nothing 
               to do. The camera pans past the hut to a small white church with 
               a simple cross and a white picket fence.]

                         Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. 
                         I was chosen for my mission work to 
                         come here to Africa and teach you all 
                         about the teachings of Jesus.  Okay 
                         then, do we have our Bibles that were 
                         handed out freely?  No no no, we don't 
                         eat the Bibles, we read them.  Now, 
                         let's turn to Mark 3:19.  Come on, remember 
                         : reading Bible plus accepting Jesus 
                         equals food.  Good. Now, who can read 
                         Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin?

                         to Marklar, that would be fine. Just 
                         take our marklar back to Marklar and 
                         bring all the marklar back with you.

                         You must explain one at a Marklar.

                         Alien friend, we are here to spread 
                         the Word of Jesus. He died for your 
                         sins.
 
                                     MARKLAR
                         Who? Marklar?

                                     STAN
                         We brought Marvin and his people to 
                         live here, but these buttholes followed 
                         us.

                         What is "marklar"?

                                     MARKLAR
                         Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything 
                         is referred to as marklar.

                         Doesn't that get confusing?

                                     MARKLAR
                         Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!

                                     MARKLAR
                          Yes?

                                     MARKLAR
                         You see?

                                     KYLE
                          Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this 
                         whole thing. Marklar, these marklars 
                         want to change your marklar. They don't 
                         want Marklar or any of these marklars 
                         to live here because it's bad for their 
                         marklar. They use Marklar to try and 
                         force marklars to believe they're marklar. 
                         If you let them stay here, they will 
                         build marklars and marklars. They will 
                         take all your marklars and replace them 
                         with Marklar. These marklar have no 
                         good marklar to live on Marklar, so 
                         they must come here to Marklar. Please, 
                         let these marklars stay where they can 
                         grow and prosper without any marklars, 
                         marklars, eh or marklars.
 
                                     MARKLAR
                         Young marklar, your marklars are wise 
                         and true.
