               [South Park, woods, night. Six boys look at a tree stump surrounded 
               by litter. They are Jimmy, Toke, Craig, Clyde, Kyle, and Cartman. 
               Kyle is carrying a black trash bag. On the stump is a marijuana 
               joint and some paper]
 
                                     KYLE
                          Throw it away, Clyde!

                                     CLYDE
                         I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it 
                         away.

                          Some high schoolers left their marijuana 
                         cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw 
                         it away before some kids find it or 
                         something.
 
                                     STAN
                         So throw it away.

                                     CLYDE
                         Nobody wants to touch it.

                         What if the residue gets on our hands 
                         and it leads to harder drugs like those 
                         commercials say.
 
                                     CRAIG
                         Yeah, didn't you see that commercial 
                         where it says that if you have pot you 
                         could become a terrorist?
 
                                     CLYDE
                         And the commercial where the two kids 
                         have pot and the one kids shoots the 
                         other. Harmless?
 
                                     STAN
                         You guys, those commercials are just 
                         exaggerations.

                         How do you know? None of us had ever 
                         had any drugs before.

                         Well, I did Ecstacy once.  Me and my 
                         girlfriend took it and we stayed up 
                         all night having... sex. 
 
                                     KYLE
                         ...Where did you have sex with her?
 
                         
                                     JIMMY
                         In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank 
                         you. What a terrific audience.

                          It's just a stupid plant that makes 
                         you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          Then you throw it away, smartass. 
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched 
                         marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't 
                         shoot anybody, and I don't feel like 
                         doing more drugs now. No big deal.

               relentlessly flashes all over town. Stan's house is shown as 
               lightning strikes it. In the living room Stan watches "The Osbournes" 
               with his grandfather. Ozzy is shown in his living room talking 
               to his kids]

                         In other news, South Park police are 
                         still looking for a craaazy man who 
                         terrorized the town one hour ago.  The 
                         man claimed to be from the future and 
                         ran naked through the city streets screaming 
                         "The past! The past! Oh my God, it's 
                         the past!" Which is what one would expect 
                         someone in the future to yell.

                         I can still remember when I was five 
                         and you both found that squirrel I'd 
                         been keeping in the closet and, you 
                         let me keep it for another week and 
                         then it ran away but... I know that's 
                         just what you told me. I know that Mom 
                         had actually let it out.

                         unless... he is our son from the future.

                         to go asleep in an alley behind the 
                         crackhouse,  and I shot up a little 
                         heroin, and then this electrical storm 
                         started. Next thing I knew I was running 
                         around in my own past, man. I thought... 
                         I was just tripping, but then I came 
                         down and I was still here. Oh, dude, 
                         it's so bizarre!

                         the electrical storm last night and 
                         is caught in a time matrix. He's me 
                         when I'm 32.

                         and that's consequences. They need to 
                         see consequences from their actions, 
                         or else they'll never learn. What my 
                         company does is inflicts those consequences 
                         upon the parents in a very real and 
                         very direct way.

                         truth is there's no hard evidence that 
                         second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe 
                         it's okay to lie about it as long as 
                         it gets people to stop smoking.

                         So it is with everything here at Motivation 
                         Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell 
                         kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. 
                          Or that... one pill of Ecstacy is gonna 
                         kill them. It's not necessarily true, 
                         but the ends justify the means.

                         Okay, Butters, let's start with you. 
                         I thnk I've found a great way to get 
                         revenge on your parents. Just... tell 
                         me if I'm going in the right direction 
                         here.  What we're going to do, Butters, 
                         is we're going to wait for your parents 
                         to leave the house, and then, smear 
                         all the walls... with poop.

                         Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. 
                         I wanna find the perfect one, tailored 
                         to your revenge on your parents.

                         Now, personally, I like the baby green. 
                          But I also think the classic brown 
                         would go nicely with your house.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, 
                         Eric! I don't know which swatch I like 
                         best.

                         uh Butters, is go with the baby green 
                         in the living room, and then maybe a 
                         classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn 
                         crunch in your parents' bedroom.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well that sounds good.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, well let's do that then. That 
                         looks nice.
 
                                     BUTTERS

                                     CARTMAN
                         Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put 
                         together a really nice design. I feel 
                         your parents were a bit more cocky about 
                         lying to you and your revenge needs 
                         to reflect that. So what I wanna to 
                         is put a note on your parents' door, 
                         telling them I'm the counselor from 
                         the school.
 
                                     STAN
                          Yeah.

                                     CARTMAN
                         The note will inform them that a problem 
                         has come up and they need to see me 
                         right-away, back at my office.
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Your parents will drive all the way 
                         out to the school and discover that 
                         no meeting is actually taking place.

                         smear all their walls with poop.

                         walls with poop. I thought his revenge 
                         was unique and customized!

                         now, Stan, and... have you seen the 
                         poop swatches.

                         Dude, that's not extreme enough! My 
                         parents aren't gonna learn their lesson 
                         from having some crap smeared on their 
                         walls! I want them to see what they 
                         did was wrong! I want them to have them 
                         to admit that they lied to me!

                         and then it's too extreme; where do

                         what you're doing!

                         about it, Butters. You're gonna be a

                         black went really nice in the lobby.

                         Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge 
                         box of cookies as a present.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Thanks. But you know, all this talk 
                         about future selves has made me think, 
                         maybe I should ...take better care of 
                         myself. I mean, maybe I should think 
                         about who I'm going to become.
 
                                     FUTURE CARTMAN
                          Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right 
                         choice.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     FUTURE CARTMAN
                         Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the 
                         future.  I came back to tell you that 
                         this is the day you turn it all around. 
                         You stop eating junk food and you start 
                         studying harder, you stay away from 
                         drugs and alcohol and you become CEO 
                         of your own time-travel company!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! 
                         Now I'll really work to be successful!
 
                         
                                     FUTURE CARTMAN
                         Right on!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Go have sex with yourself, asshole! 
                         I'm not that stupid! Just for that, 
                         I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating 
                         what I waunt, and doin' drugs when I 
                         waunt!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I waunt!
 
                         
                                     FUTURE CARTMAN
                         No, wait!  Oh, God-damnit!

               THE END
