               [A panoramic view of South Park, day. Holiday music is heard 
               in the background, and the scenes are played out as the narrator 
               mentions them]

                         Way up in the mountains in a small little 
                         town,
 
               The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.

               People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
 
               
               Because Christmas need to be bought in a store.

               But out in the forest, not too far away...

               [A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest 
               upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate 
               it.]

                         ...The little woodland critters were 
                         also preparing for their Christmas day.
 
                         
                                     WOODLAND CRITTERS
                         It's almost time when the time is here,
 
                         
               The time that's only once a year.

               We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.

               A Woodland Critter Christmas!

                                     NARRATOR
                         The little critters worked hard as they 
                         happily sang
 
               And each one of them had a quite interesting name

               There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,

               Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear

               Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,

               Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer

               Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,

               and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
 
               
               And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,

               was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.

                                     STAN
                          What the hell?

                                     SINGER
                         Christmastime is once a year

               Every critter holds it dear

               Every animal big or small

               Christmas means so much to us all

               [The forest. The critters approach Stan.]

                                     RABBITY
                         Well hello there. Welcome to our forest.
 
                         
                                     SKUNKY
                         How do you like our Christmas tree?
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         It's... nice.

                                     BEAVERY
                         Why, it's the most perfect tree in the 
                         forest! 
 
                                     MOUSEY
                         Oh no, I see a problem.

                                     DEERY
                         What is it, Mousey?

                                     MOUSEY
                         Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.
 
                         
                                     CRITTERS
                         Ohhhh

                                     BEARY
                         We can't have a tree with no star on 
                         it.
 
                                     RABBITY
                         What are we gonna do?

                                     SQUIRRELY
                         Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our 
                         new friend can help us find a star.
 
                         
                                     CRITTERS
                          Can you really? Oh would you please? 
                         Could you help us?
 
                                     STAN
                         Okay, okay.

                                     CRITTERS
                          Yay!!

                                     NARRATOR
                         And so, using some paper and working 
                         with glee,
 
               the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree

                                     CRITTERS
                         Ohhhh

                                     BEARY
                         It's the nicest star I ever saw.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The little critters cheered and Beavery 
                         said with a smile
 
                                     BEAVERY
                         How would you like to sing and dance 
                         with us for a while?
 
                                     NARRATOR
                         The boy in the red poofball hat smiled 
                         and said
 
                                     STAN
                          Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. 
 
                         
                                     BEAVERY
                         Goo, goodbye Stanny!

                                     CRITTERS
                         Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy 
                         your hat!
 
                                     STAN
                         Wugh.

               [Stan's bedroom, night. He's asleep in bed, but wakes up, turns 
               over, and turns on his light]
 
                                     CRITTERS
                         Hi, Stanny!

                                     STAN
                         Oh, whatta? 

                                     NARRATOR
                         His friends were all there! What a wonderful 
                         surprise!
 
               The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes

                                     STAN
                          What time is it!

                                     SQUIRRELY
                         You aren't gonna believe what happened, 
                         Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas 
                         gift ever!
 
                                     SKUNKY
                         Porcupiney is pregnant!

                                     STAN
                          You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
 
                         
                                     MOUSEY
                         I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand 
                         the seriousness of the fertilization.
 
                         
                                     DEERY
                         Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her 
                         conception was immaculate.

                         She's gonna give birth to our Lord and 
                         Savior.
 
                                     STAN
                         ...What?

                                     PORCUPINEY
                         It has been foretold unto me that I 
                         would give birth on Christmas Day.
 
                         
                                     MOUSEY
                         So soon!

                                     SKUNKY
                         How delightful!

                         Our souls are saved!

                                     CHICKADEE-Y
                         Finally the critters are gonna have 
                         a Savior of their very own, of their 
                         very own! 
 
                                     SQUIRRELY
                          There's just one problem: We don't 
                         have a manger for our Savior to be born 
                         in.
 
                                     CRITTERS
                         Awwww.

                                     BEARY
                         But we got to have a manger.

                                     RABBITY
                         Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us 
                         a manger? Huh? 
 
                                     NARRATOR
                         "Of course I'll build you a little manger!" 
                         the little boy cried,
 
               and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!
 
               
               [The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last 
               few nails in place]
 
                                     NARRATOR
                         And out in the woods the boy steamed 
                         right ahead,
 
               making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head

                                     RABBITY
                         Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger 
                         I ever saw.
 
                                     MOUSEY
                         I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly 
                         suitable resting place, for the Son 
                         of our Lord.

                                     PORCUPINEY
                         My Son will have the nicest bed in all 
                         the forest.

                                     SQUIRRELY
                         This is going to be the best critter 
                         Christmas ever!

               The time that's only once a year.

               We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near-

                          All right, I'm going now 

                                     CRITTERS
                         The mountain lion! Hide! 

                                     STAN
                         Go away! Shoo! 

                                     SQUIRRELY
                         Is it gone?

                                     MOUSEY
                         I deduce it is.

                         Well, this is the end. The mountain 
                         lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, 
                         and he's gonna kill it again.
 
                                     STAN
                         Again?

                                     SQUIRRELY
                         Every Christmas the mountain lion comes 
                         down and eats the virgin critter impregnated 
                         with the Son of our Lord.
 
                                     PORCUPINEY
                         Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.

                                     BEAVERY
                          Let's face it. The mountain lion will 
                         never let our Savior be born.
 
                                     CRITTERS
                         Awwww.

                         Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. 
                         We've got Stanny!
 
                                     RACCOONY
                         Of course! Stanny can do anything! If 
                         he can build a manger, he can stop that 
                         mean ol' mountain lion!

                         Christmas is saved!

                         High up in the forest on a dark, craggy 
                         peak,
 
               the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.

               For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty 
               old cat...
 
                                     STAN
                         Goddamnit, this is fucking ridiculous!

                         Said the little boy in the red poofball 
                         hat.
 
               [he looks at a cave entrance, then up at the peak]

               Killing the mountain lion was no easy task,

               but he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast. 

                                     STAN
                          Grrr. Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, 
                         critter killer! Your days of slaughtering 
                         innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! 
                          Rawrrrrr!

                         In a flash it was over! A victorious 
                         blow!
 
               The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.

               and approaches]

                         Why did you kill our mommy? Why?

                         The tiny cubs all gathered together 
                         and cried,
 
               All alone in the world because their mother had died.

                                     STAN
                          Aw. Awww!

               [The forest floor, night. The critters have set up a campfire 
               close to the manger and are keeping warm by it.]

                         Well, it's been much too long now. Uh 
                         I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny 
                         must be very dead.

                         Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed 
                         him whole.

                         I guess that means our Savior is gonna 
                         be made into Savior stew.

                         But, does that mean you killed the mountain 
                         lion?
 
                                     STAN
                         It's dead.

                         I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.

                         You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! 
                         Without the mountain lion around, the 
                         Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the 
                         Antichrist!

                         was giving birth to your savior!

                         Well, think about it: You really think 
                         God would have sex with a porcupine?

                         No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness 
                         and King of all Evil would do that! 
                         Yay!

               [the other critters cheer. Stan is frozen stunned as Beary pulls 
               up a satanic altar on a small wagon with a little help from Squirrely. 
               The other animals bring Rabbity up to the altar. Rabbity is propped 
               up on the altar and Beary tears him apart with a big knife. The 
               other animals crowd in, tear away pieces of the body, and eat 
               them raw]

               the orgy. Beavery mounts Raccoony, Skunky mounts Porcupiney, 
               Mousey mounts foxy, and Beary mounts Deery. Squirrely hope onto 
               Deery's left ear and mounts that. Chickadee-y flits around. In 
               the background is heard "Sting, so true!" Stan is traumatized 
               now.]

               decorate it. As the narrator speaks, the following takes place. 
               The star atop the manger is turned so it points down. Owls bring 
               flowers to the mountain lion's corpse. The lion cubs are shown, 
               then the mountain peak, then Stan is shown with his head buried 
               into his arms at his desk in his room]

                         In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas 
                         Eve morn,
 
               The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be 
               born.
 
               The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
 
               
               But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
 
               
               And meanwhile three lion cubs were crying away.

               For them there would certainly be no Christmas Day,

               And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
 
               
               All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.

                         the Antichrist is born, we must find 
                         a human host body to transfer it into.

               And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.

               leaves, and the next one is worked on. One of the cubs is on 
               a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle 
               off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone 
               turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The 
               doctor works on the next patient and the dark cub brings him 
               some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The 
               other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and
