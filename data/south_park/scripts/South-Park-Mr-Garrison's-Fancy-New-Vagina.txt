               [Trinidad Medical Center, day. A very modern, futuristic-looking 
               building is seen behind the sign. Inside, a doctor approaches 
               a patient]
 
                                     DOCTOR
                         Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. 
                         I'll be performing your surgery today.
 
                         
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll 
                         make me well again.
 
                                     DR. BIBER
                         Now, you're absolutely sure you want 
                         a vaginoplasty?
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         My whole life I've been a woman trapped 
                         in a man's body. A sex-change operation 
                         is my last chance at happiness.
 
                                     DR. BIBER
                         All right, then let's begin.  Just relax, 
                         Mr. Garrison. I think if more people 
                         could just see a sex-change operation, 
                         they would know how perfectly natural 
                         it is. The first thing I'm going to 
                         do is slice your balls. 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Ough, ergh. Eww. 

                                     DR. BIBER
                         With the scrotum open, I can now discard 
                         of your testicles.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         So long, balls. 

                                     DR. BIBER
                         Now, I'll just continue the incision 
                         up the shaft of the penis. 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, that stings.

                                     DR. BIBER
                         Now I'll just... turn your... penis 
                         inside out.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         OH! Oh jeez.

                                     DR. BIBER
                         All we need to do now is ...stuff the 
                         ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... 
                         And now I'll use the skin from your 
                         penis to make vaginal lips.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Do I look like a woman?

                                     DR. BIBER
                          Pretty much.

                         Gerald, that is very closed-minded of 
                         you! You shouldn't judge people who 
                         want to change.

                          It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes 
                         a person' outside doesn't reflect who 
                         they are on the inside.

                         can have a surgery  that makes them 
                         more into the person they see themselves

                         So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive 
                         surgery.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be 
                         a woman, and you made him into one.

                         Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had 
                         a vaginoplasty. Mhm.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Well, do you also do other surgeries 
                         like that?
 
                                     DR. BIBER
                         Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants 
                         to be a man. That procedure is called 
                         a peniplasty.

                         Wha-a-a negroplasty??

                                     DR. BIBER
                         It's a fairly common procedure, really, 
                         just the reverse of a caucasioplasty 
                         just like Michael Jackson had. Let's 
                         take a look here.  What we do is slice 
                         your face and peel it back so we can 
                         insert now pig-ment producing cells 
                         inside.  We break the arm bones in several 
                         places and put braces to make them longer. 
                          Now, the knees we need to snap off 
                         and fill with small round objects that 
                         can cause better movement.  And we finish 
                         it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance 
                         the genitalia.  Negroplasty takes about 
                         seven hours and costs roughly three 
                         thousand dollars.

                         Uh excuse me, is this really a good 
                         idea?
 
                                     DR. BIBER
                         Well, it's a good idea if you wanna 
                         be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't 
                         recommend it.

                         A woman's work is never done.  I got 
                         some tampons. I should be getting my 
                         period really soon. I hope I don't get 
                         too emotional and drive you crazy with 
                         my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got somethin' 
                         for us, too.  Would you like to take 
                         this beautiful woman to bed?

                         and had that surgery without even asking 
                         me what I thought.

                         Well, normally, if a woman misses her 
                         period, it means she's pregnant.

                         negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State

                         Well, ah I only made him look like he 
                         could play basketball. If he actually 
                         does it, the testicle in his knees will

                                     DR. BIBER
                         No, I just made him look more like one. 
                         We have to stop him from playing! Those 
                         testicles in his knees are ticking time
