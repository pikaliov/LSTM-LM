               [Cartman's house. A television is heard. The screen shows an 
               Australian crocodile hunter narrating his adventures as a woman 
               pilots his boat down a river.]

                         As we steer our boat down , looking 
                         for these dangerous predatorsÂ… Boy, 
                         there's a king croc right here.  He 
                         must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long 
                         at least.  This croc has enough power 
                         in its jaws to rip my head right off.

                         I've got to be careful. So, what I'm 
                         gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my 
                         thumb in its butthole.

                          Well! That was quite an angry croc! 
                         But I managed to escape with only a 
                         few bruises and a shattered left testicle. 
                         Next week we'll look for more of these 
                         beautiful creatures, so we can learn 
                         more about them by pissing them off 
                         immensely. Thanks for watching.

                         They're after you! 

                                     AUSSIE
                         Oh, he's a wily one! 

                                     LARRY
                         Oh, poo!

                                     KYLE
                         Steve, look out! 

                                     AUSSIE
                          Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric 
                         man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. 
                         As well as he should be, as I will now 
                         jam my thumb up his butthole.
 
                                     LARRY
                         Huh?  Whah?!

                                     AGENT
                          Stop the train!

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Hey, who are you?

                                     AGENT
                         I said, stop that train!

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Yes, hello. I see you.

                                     CARTMAN
                         They're all movin' pretty fast, but 
                         I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
 
               [atop the train, Larry and the Aussie wrestle.]

                                     LARRY
                          I've got you pinned. I win.

                                     AUSSIE
                          Now I've got you pinned. I win! 

                                     CONDUCTOR
                          Whoa!

                                     AGENT
                          Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here! 
                          Go get him, boys!  Cut him off!
 
                                     LARRY
                          Nooo!

                                     AUSSIE
                         Now for the coup de gras. I'll justÂ… 
                         get myÂ… thumb upÂ… here.
 
                                     LARRY
                          Oohh!

               [the helicopter lands in front of the train, but the train rolls 
               on]
 
                                     PILOT
                         Aah, the train's not stopping.  It's 
                         not stopping!  AAAAAAAA! 
 
                                     AUSSIE
                          Holy bum-! 

                                     STAN
                          Where's Gorak??

                                     PILOT
                          Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing 
                         I've ever seen.
 
                                     AGENT
                         Where's the ice man?!

                                     MEPHESTO
                         He has to be around here somewhere. 
                         
 
                                     KYLE
                         I can't believe he's gone.

                                     STAN
                          Wait, look! The helicopter! 

                                     KYLE
                         Hey!

                                     STAN
                         He's alive!

                                     LARRY
                          Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
 
                         
                                     MEPHESTO
                         No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll 
                         never live!
 
                                     LARRY
                         I'm not living here! Living is having 
                         ups and downs and sharing them with 
                         friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle! 
                         See ya! 
 
                                     AGENT
                          Damn! Well, so much for our plan to 
                         use the ice man to take over Sweden.
 
                         
                                     MEPHESTO
                          What?!

                                     AGENT
                         What? Nothing!

                                     STAN
                         Kyle, Steve was aÂ… pretty good name 
                         for that guy.
 
                                     KYLE
                         No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's 
                         original. And besides, you found him.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, 
                         hahahahahaha.
 
                                     STAN
                          Could we be best friends again?  I 
                         hate having Cartman as a best friend.
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Me, too. He sucks.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys 
                         anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha! 
                         There's a king croc right there!  And 
                         what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak 
                         up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
 
                         
                                     COW
                         Moo! 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! 
                         Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
 
                         
                                     THE END
