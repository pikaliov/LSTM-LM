                         Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first 
                         on marijawana . Marijawana's bad, and 
                         it also has a very distinct smell, mkay?

                         a smell , so you know when someone is 
                         smoking marijawana near you. Mkay, just 
                         take a smell, pass it on,  and when 
                         it gets back up to me,  we'll finish 
                         talking about it. In the meantime, I 
                         want to get into alcohol a little, okay?
