               a stage is off to the left, and the whole place is being dressed 
               for Halloween. Beyond the lake, a lighthouse looks over the scene.

                         and everyone is decorating for tomorrow 
                         night,  HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, 
                         that's right, KoRn, is going to play 
                         live! And don't forget to wear a costume

                         This one time, like eight months ago, 
                         I saw two guys kissing in a park. And 
                         that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, 
                         until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt.

                         would be stiff and dry, so he would 
                         have to have it soaked in warm water 
                         for several hours before making love

                         It is highly possible that he has created 
                         new orifices in her decomposing flesh, 
                         leaving her to look something like  
                         an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She 
                         probably-

                         me what you're gonna do about it!

                         call the police or something.

                          Now, he probably would make love to 
                         the dead body in a cool dry place, so 
                         as not to allow further decomposition.

                         Okay, people. I know we all want to 
                         get down to the docks for the Halloween 
                         Haunt, but first we just need to inform 
                         you about thee- people or persons out 
                         there digging up bodies to have sex 
                         with them. Gentlemen?

                         Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 
                         A person who steals bodies to have sex 
                         with them is called a necrophiliac. 
                         So that you all know what to expect, 
                         my partner Alan has a sketch of what 
                         having sex with a dead body might look 
                         like.

                         best you not look at it. Now, Alan will 
                         demostrate what having sex with a dead 
                         body might sound like.

                         They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, 
                         they're ghost pirates.

                         "Pirate ghost" would suggest that a 
                         pirate died, and became a ghost, but 
                         a ghost pirate is a ghost that later 
                         made a conscious decision to be a pirate.

                         No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, 
                         because they're the ghosts of pirates.
 
                         
                                     FIELDY
                         You're wrong, because there were no 
                         pirates in Colorado. So these must be 
                         ghosts that have decided to become pirates 
                         after the fact.

                                     DAVID
                         No. It makes them ghost pirates.

                         would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates?

                         It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want 
                         there to be a Halloween, so he decided 
                         to scare everyone away from the docks.

                         and some cotton swabs to create the 
                         ghosts.

                         a mirror, and two squirrels.

                         Ho-hoh.

                                     CHEF
                         Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers 
                         really came through for us!
 
                                     SHARON
                         Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you 
                         please play for our Halloween party?
 
                         
                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, sure. Why the heck not?

                                     MOB
                         All right! 

                                     PIRATE VOICE
                         Raarrrr!

                                     STAN
                         Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! 
                         
 
                                     ALL
                         Nibblet!

                                     NIBBLET
                         Uh oh!

               [The stage on the docks. KoRn is preparing for their concert. 
               The mob is spread out in front of the stage. Jonathan takes the 
               mic.]
 
                                     JONATHAN
                         Well, this sure has been a wacky night, 
                         but me and the gang learned a lot, and 
                         we hope you did too. You all perceived 
                         us to be mean, evil people, but, really, 
                         we're just normal guys. And we all perceived 
                         pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, 
                         they were just cotton swabs. So I guess 
                         the lesson is: it's easy to perceive 
                         somethin' someway, and then be wrong. 
                         So we all need to learn to be a little 
                         less perceptive.
 
                                     ALL
                          Yeah.

                                     JONATHAN
                         The gang and I wrote a song about it, 
                         and it goes goes a little somethin' 
                         like this:
 
               And a-one, and-a-two, and a [goes right into "Falling Away From 
               Me." The strobe lights come on, and the crowd looks a little 
               stunned. The fifth graders are at the very front of the crowd, 
               and the body of Grandma Broflovski inches up to them]

                         Boo!

                         Aaaah! 

                                     STAN, KYLE
                         Sweet! 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken 
                         from outer space... thing, come back here!

                         And the winner of the costume contest 
                         is  Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! 
                         Come on up, Wendy.

               Kenny walks away slowly from the crowd. A tiny snowspeeder flies 
               by and wraps a cable around his costume's legs. He begins to 
               stumble]
