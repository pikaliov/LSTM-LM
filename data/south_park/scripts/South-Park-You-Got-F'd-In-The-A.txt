                         and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your 
                         parents and let them know you're okay.

                         good. Listen: Stan and his friends just 
                         got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the 
                         True Value. No no, he's fine. They're 
                         all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from 
                         out of town. Apparently they were pretty 
                         good dancers. They really let 'em have 
                         it.

                         Naw, that's crap, Sharon! Stanley, when 
                         somebody challenges you to dance, you 
                         have to dance back at them, or else 
                         they'll think you're weak.

                         All right son, dancing is all about 
                         a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling 
                         you to go around challenging other kids 
                         to dance, but when they challenge you, 
                         you just look 'em straight in the eye, 
                         and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.

                         to keep your hands at your sides and 
                         your eyes looking at the ground. Then

                         a dance competition this Saturday and 
                         I need good dancers so I don't get served.

                          No way. Dancing is something you do 
                         alone in your room at three in the morning.

                         reputation is at stake! Will any of 
                         you do it?

                         I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group 
                         is totally conformist.

                         Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off 
                         regulations.

                         I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest 
                         nonconformist of all.

                         going to conform with the rest of you. 
                         Okay, I'll do it.

                         on! And there are people who need you 
                         to step up! Look, nobody likes having

                         against other people and getting in

                         than you!" is part of life. And if you 
                         can't face that, then you might as well 
                         sit here and play Leggos until you're

                         to stop running from what happened and 
                         start dealing with it. Otherwise, you
