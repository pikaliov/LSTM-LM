                         But I hate the eye doctor. He always 
                         makes fun of me for being fat.

                         That's what I told him, but he doesn't 
                         listen to reason.

                         Hello, Eric.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Hi, Dr. Lott

                                     DR. LOTT
                         How's my little piggy today?

                                     CARTMAN
                          Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
 
                         
                                     DR. LOTT
                         I just say that because you're my little 
                         buddy.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! 
                         Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
 
                                     DR. LOTT
                         Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it 
                         now!

                          God damn it!

                                     DR. LOTT
                         Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes 
                         are doing.  All you have to do is read 
                         the letters. Can you see the letters?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LOTT
                         All right, read them out for me.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I am a little piggy.

               Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and 
               pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom!
 
                                     DR. LOTT
                         No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. 
                          I do not know how that happened.  "I 
                         am a little piggy." Wow! What are the 
                         odds of that?  All right, let's get 
                         down to business, shall we? 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't 
                         paying you to be a comedian!
 
                                     DR. LOTT
                          Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, 
                         or two? One, or two?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         They look exactly the same.

                                     DR. LOTT
                         Just pick one. Or two.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't know, two!

                                     DR. LOTT
                          Okay. One, or two? One, or two?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Uh, one.

                                     DR. LOTT
                          One, or two? One, or two?

                                     CARTMAN
                          Two.

                                     DR. LOTT
                         No! The answer is one, piggy! One! 
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Ow! I hate you!

                                     DR. LOTT
                          Yes, there is obviously a problem with 
                         your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate 
                         them and run some tests.

                         today?

                         Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, 
                         he still shows up for lunch.

                         the library checking out some books 
                         on kama sutra when I met the most amazing 
                         woman ever. She knew so much about so 
                         many things. She really got me thinking. 
                         We eventually came back to my place 
                         and really hit it off.

                         All right guys! That's enough! I have 
                         had it with you! This is the happiest 
                         time of my life, and you can't be happy 
                         for me!

                         No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and 
                         I am marrying her! Now you can either 
                         accept that, or get out of my life!

                         likes her more than us.

                         how to destroy a Succubus.

                         eerie melody. This is the Succubi power.

                         vanquish the succubus power."

               the succubus drops down into the hole. The flames leave with 
               her. Chef walks up to the hold and looks over it]

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah, well, I learned a very important 
                         lesson this week:
 
               
               [begins to sing]

               Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.
 
               
               You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think 
               it can't get any better.
 
               But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.
 
               
               And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your 
               dong.
 
               
               So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon 
               wind!
 
               Just play it cool and don't be a fool...

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          And never let poontang come between 
                         you and your friend.
 
                                     CHEF
                         Daaamn right, Garrison! 

               [The optometrist's office. Cartman walks in with a large ice 
               box. His bandages are off. Now we know why he wasn't at school 
               with Stan and Kyle.]
 
                                     DR. LOTT
                         Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes 
                         doing?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         After today they're gonna be fine, and 
                         I'll never have to see you ever again!
 
                         
                                     DR. LOTT
                         I don't think that's possible, piggy, 
                         not with your eyes.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha

                         Eh-sure.

                                     DR. LOTT
                         All right, then let's get to work.  
                         Say, you don't have three dollars and
