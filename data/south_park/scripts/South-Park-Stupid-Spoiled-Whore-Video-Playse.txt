                          Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little 
                         spent. I did a whole lot of partying 
                         last night with a LOT of different guys. 
                          Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Douth 
                         Dark to announce the opening of my brand 
                         new store! A store where girls can buy 
                         everything they need to be just like 
                         me! Stupid Spoiled Whore!  Have fun, 
                         girls. And remember to party, and be 
                         super-lame to everybody. Bye!  Give 
                         me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink!

                         important than being rich is being famous!

                         Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like 
                         to be your boyfriend and all, uh even 
                         though you have kind of a big nose, 
                         but my parents told me, "never get into 
                         a car with a stranger."

                         Butters, never get into a car with a 
                         stranger! Unless it's a limosine.

                         Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd 
                         be all right.

                         Hi, sweetie. What's the matter.

                                     WENDY
                         Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about 
                         the role models young women have in 
                         today's society.
 
                                     DAD
                         Oh?

                                     WENDY
                         It seems that lewdness and shallowness 
                         are being exalted, while intellectualism 
                         is looked down upon.
 
                                     DAD
                         ...Gosh.

                                     WENDY
                         I think young women are being marketed 
                         to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
 
                         
                                     DAD
                         Well, we'll get right on fixing that, 
                         sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right?

                          Dad, there's a new store at the mall 
                         called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm 
                         gonna go there and buy a thong!
 
                                     DAD
                          What?! No daughter of mine is going 
                         to dress like a whore! We're marching 
                         down to that store right now, young 
                         lady!

               the store. He looks around]

                         God!  Mrs. Polk, you're buying this 
                         stuff for your daughter?!
 
                                     MRS. POLK
                          It's what's in right now. I, I can't 
                         have my little girl be the only one 
                         not in a trend; she'll be unpopular. 
                         
 
                                     MR. TESTABURGER
                         Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!  
                         But these are our girls!
 
                                     MRS. STEVENS
                         I think it's empowering for them. I 
                         mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, 
                         it's "normal," but if a woman wants 
                         to be one, it's "WRONG."

                         But, when a man pees standing up, it's 
                         "normal," but when a woman does it, 
                         it's "weeeird."

                         Yeah! Right!

                                     WOMAN 2
                         Yeah, like, when men shave their balls 
                         it's fine, but when a woman does it 
                         she's "straaange."
 
                                     FEMALES
                         Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!

                         want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause 
                         I'm a whore.
 
                                     MR. TESTABURGER
                          Oh, uh uh sure I, I can buy a purse.

                         Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. 
                         You see, you have to believe in the 
                         rights of women. For too long they've 
                         had to live a double standard.  Oh yeah. 
                          I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, 
                         Wendy. From now on you can have whatever 
                         you want from this store, I'll help 
                         make you the stupidest, most spoiled 
                         whore of them all!

                         Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, 
                         I was born a whore. I've been one... 
                         ever since I can remember.  Ever since 
                         I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... 
                         different things.

                         take my temperature?  Oooo, Jezuth Christh.

                         was never enough.
