                         Kyle, you're not old enough, and those 
                         concerts are dangerous and vile.

                         The answer is no, Kyle!

                         he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's 
                         not telling his parents anything, 'cause 
                         they're alcoholics and they don't care!

                         time to work on them. I'll see you guys

                         the house? Come on, you're being unfair!

                         Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the 
                         Raging Pussies concert if you clean 
                         out the garage, shovel the driveway 
                         and bring democracy to Cuba!

                         A communist country run by a dictator

                         And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, 
                         or just the side the car is on?
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         The whole thing.

                                     DEAR MR. CASTRO
                         
               
               My name is Kyle. 

               [thinks]

               I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
 
               
               [Centro Nacional de Cuba. Castro, flanked by an armed guard on 
               each side, is at his desk reading Kyle's letter]
 
               And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
 
               
               If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.

               [Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which 
               fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter]
 
               Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain

               All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea

               [Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world 
               globe]
 
               Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free

               [Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house]

               I just can't be very happy, that's certain

               [Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees 
               last]
 
               Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your 
               mind?
 
               That is my one and only wish.

               Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced 
               by a young boy's letter. [A shot of Kyle behind a wooden fence

                         going to the Raging Pussies concert! 
                         We gave you a chore that we thought 
                         was impossible. You weren't supposed 
                         to actually do it.

                         you going to their concert.

                         buh- but you need to understand that 
                         we don't want-

                         screwed me over!! So why should I have 
                         to listen to you?!

                         Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta 
                         do is call the police and say that your 
                         parents both molestered you.

                         I don't know, but it works. When I wanted 
                         to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, 
                         I just called the police, and said he 
                         was molestering me, and I haven't seen 
                         him for three months.

                         Who cares? My parents deserve whatever 
                         they get. They're liars and cheats.

                         You have to make it convincing, though, 
                         when you call the police. You have to 
                         be like,  "my parents molestered me."

                         No, but you've gotta cry, like this: 
                          "My parents molestered me."  And then 
                         they'll say somethng like, "Was it a 
                         good touch or a bad touch?" and you 
                         say  "Ih, it was a good touch" or- no

                          Way back, in the long long ago, we 
                         all lived by the birthgivers' laws. 
                         But the birthgivers were unfair. They 
                         made us go to bed early and eat broccoli.

                          And so the fatass came up with a way 
                         to have all the birthgivers disappear. 
                         , by using the magic M word.

                         Soon we were without power, water, or 
                         fresh food. But we tried to survive.

                         The fatass and us disagreed on how to 
                         worship the provider. The fatass tried 
                         to make us follow his way by making 
                         himself the school principal. So we 
                         made ourselves the superintendents of 
                         school. But then he just made himself 
                         the mayor. The town split sides and 
                         that's when the Provider got angry.

                         be appeased at Carousel. We need their 
                         book so one of ours doesn't die.

                         personal demons to face here. During

                         one hour a day in therapy here with

                         control those sick, sexual urges you 
                         have. Now we're gonna try an exercise:

                         you to just look at this child. Just 
                         try to suppress your urges to rape him.

                         about clouds and beaches. Don't think 
                         about his supple, soft little body.

                         of you. Most of you are still in denial

                         you've never raped your children at 
                         all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu.
