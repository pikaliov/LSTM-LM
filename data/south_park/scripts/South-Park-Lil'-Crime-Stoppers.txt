                         We're wondering if you have any crimes 
                         to be solved, for a dollar.

                         I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I 
                         need solved right now.

                         cherry pie out on my window sill to 
                         cool.  And later, when I went to get

                         sill, where it must have sat for some 
                         time.  But its sweet smell attracted

                         be just what we need to get our drugs 
                         past the security at DIA. How would 
                         you like to join our family?

                         before, man. These kids are 5-0!

                         drug business. Everything was fine until 
                         these "supercops" joined the force.

                         Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let 
                         anybody know about our partnership.

                         That's right.  I think we'll take a 
                         hundred percent now.
 
                                     JENKINS
                         Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business 
                         like this, sometimes partnerships need 
                         to end.
 
                                     MURPHY
                         That's right.  Sometimes partnerships 
                         need to end.  Well, supercops, looks 
                         like I'll be taking in all the money 
                         now. I'm in business alone. And that 
                         means that the only person I can't trust... 
                         is myself.

                          It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got 
                         what they deserved. If it weren't for 
                         you boys, we would have never cleaned 
                         up the department.

                          All right, detectives, let's get one 
                         thing straight! I do not agree with 
                         your methods! You're uncontrolled, and 
                         you're negligent! But by God you get 
                         the job done. Congratulations!

                         I'm probably going to regret this, but, 
                         well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. 
                         There'll be lots of action, and that 
                         big paycheck you've always wanted.

               The wall under the stairs has been removed to show the washer 
               and dryer, which are now framed by a doorway saying "Employees 
               Only." Two clothes racks are seen, and the detectives' desks 
               are refashioned as washer/dryer combos. A "Laundromat" sign on 
               the wall looks over the whole thing]

                         Yeah. I was up there poundin' my weiner 
                         for two days straight, aaand finally, 
                         I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, 
                         and this little timy spooge of... this 
                         white stuff came out.

                         That's great, Butters, but we're not 
                         playing Detective anymore. We're playing 
                         laundromat owners.
