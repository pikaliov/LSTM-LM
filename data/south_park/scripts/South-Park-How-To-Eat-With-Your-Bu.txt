                         Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want 
                         you to feel comfortable talking about 
                         anything, m'kay?

                         Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you 
                         can see something so funny that it ruins 
                         your sense of humor forever?
 
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         Well, I can't think of anything that 
                         would be THAT funny.

                         Two people with asses for heads. Ever 
                         since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
 
                         
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you 
                         used to think was funny?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty 
                         jokes, funny movies, seeing someone 
                         die... This morning, I even saw a little 
                         girl get her fingers caught in a car 
                         poicture and... I couldn't laugh. I 
                         mean I... I knew it was funny, but I 
                         couldn't laugh.
 
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         Well Eric, I suppose that, just like 
                         everything else, laughter can be relative 
                         - in, in other words, sometimes people 
                         see somethin' so scary that nothin' 
                         else scares them, so, the same could 
                         be true for funny things.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          So does that mean I'll never laugh 
                         again?
 
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, 
                         if you have completely lost your sense 
                         of humor, you can always become a writer

                         missing? Was he abducted?

                         Yes. He was in the care of our nanny 
                         at the time.
 
                                     MARTHA
                         The nanny that we trusted so much took 
                         off with him and we still don't know 
                         why.  We think perhaps she wanted a 
                         child of her own.

                         Yes, but we last heard the nanny was 
                         heading west.  That's why we thought 
                         Colorado made sssssense.

                         Alright, you can take the paper bag 
                         off.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-

                         it's clever to make yourself up like 
                         a girl?!

                         Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's 
                         gonna be furious!
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-

               [Cartman's room, day. Cartman sits on his bed dejected. He's 
               unwrapped a box and a gun sits on his bed to his left, a notepad 
               and pencil to his right. He picks up the pad and pencil and writes...]
 
               
                                     CARTMAN
                         Dear Mom:

               
               I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without 
               laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out 
               to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school. 
               
 
               [He sets the notepad down and looks at it for a moment, then 
               he reaches over for the gun. He opens his mouth and puts the 
               barrel of the gun in... and bites it off. It's a chocolate gun, 
               and he sets the remainder down on the bed again.]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         
               And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
 
               
               [He picks up the chocolate again and takes another bite. Then 
               he looks at the box the gun came in]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         
               Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the 
               peanut-butter filled one.
 
               
               Eric. 

               [Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A TV 4 news van and crew are present. 
               Some of the factory workers are present in the background as

               The Thompsons stand next to the preisdent. A sign behind them 
               asks, "Got Missing Kids?"]
 
                                     PRESIDENT
                         And so it is with great pride that we 
                         have flown little Billy Thompson out 
                         here, to be reunited with his parents 
                         for the first time in twenty years. 
                          Mrs. Garthunk? 
 
                                     MRS. GARTHUNK
                         Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud 
                         to be an employee of South Park Milk, 
                          which to date has found over a hundred 
                         thousand missing kids, and, led the 
                         way in the fight against curdling. Mr. 
                         and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up 
                         not knowing who his parents were.  But 
                         he was strong and resilient,  and ended 
                         up becoming very successful. I think 
                         it will amaze you as it will all of 
                         us to learn that your son... is Ben 
                         Affleck!

                         Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call

                         that's funny.

                         happened?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         A-heh, what?

                         Everything turned out okay for those

                         When Cartman first opened the door, 
                         and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for 
                         playing a joke on them. Now that everything's 
                         turnd out alright, he's able to laugh.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling 
                         of remorse.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.

                         There is no such thing as a funny fuse, 
                         Cartman. You felt bad.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Whatever. All I know is that I can 
                         laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat 
                         another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny!
