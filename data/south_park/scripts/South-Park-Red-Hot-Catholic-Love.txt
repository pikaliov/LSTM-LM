                         Parents, it's that time of year again 
                         when the bishops and priests from around 
                         the country are organizing the Young 
                         Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're 
                         taking the boys on a weekend boat trip 
                         to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator 
                         of our lives.

                         idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise 
                         with the priests.

                         With everything that's been in the news, 
                         I think it's best to keep our kids... 
                         far away from the priests.

                          Now, come on, everybody, just because 
                         a few priests in the country have been 
                         corrupted doesn't mean that all priests 
                         are child molesters.

                         Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; 
                         your son's dead. But those of us with 
                         alive children need to be sure that 
                         Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.

                         I've heard about other towns bringing 
                         in counselors that know how to find 
                         things out from kids without really 
                         telling them what's going on.

                         is... nice? Or mean?

                         it's getting a little complicated. If

                         then maybe, if you stuck food in your

                         What, that's not dumb. Think about it: 
                         food goes in the mouth, comes out the 
                         butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out

                         to report that they're being molested.

                         is that children are being molested,

                         that is allowed to take place in our

                         it is obvious that the priest doesn't

                          Our top story tonight, the age-old 
                         question has been answered: if I put 
                         food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? 
                         All over the country, people are discovering 
                         that, yes, in fact, you will.  The sugeon-general 
                         had this to say:
 
                                     SURGEON-GENERAL
                         And the uh immediate research shows 
                         that the act is not only amusing, but 
                         in fact much healthier for out bodies 
                         than the old way of eating.  You see, 
                         food entering through the anus has the 
                         benefit of being broken down on its 
                         way to the stomach rather than afterward. 
                         And therefore I believe that interorectogestion 
                         would actually put a stop to high cholesterol 
                         and most kinds of stomach cancers. And 
                         I base that on absolutely nothing.

                         In the past few days we've all heard 
                         of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, 
                         and so making food that can be inserted 
                         into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone 
                         knows that some foods are simple to 
                         shove up the ass - puddings, soups, 
                         raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding 
                         right here - but we can also still eat 
                         our favorite foods. What we're gonna 
                         do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey 
                         for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving 
                         a turkey up your ass is first wrapping 
                         it in string, keeping the pointy wings 
                         neatly at the side.

                          Not right now, I just wanna focus on 
                         my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going 
                         to baste the turkey with lubricating 
                         gel rather than with juice - this'll 
                         help smooth the insertion later on. 
                         We still bake at four hundred degrees

                         done we'll get something like this. 
                          So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. 
                         Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get 
                         it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh.

                         from the United States.

                         What do you seek, Father?

                                     PRIEST MAXI
                         I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document 
                         of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make 
                         revisions to it.
 
                                     OLD MONK
                         That Gospel...  lies somewhere beyond 
                         this door.  But... many troubles await 
                         thee inside! Only he whose heart truly 
                         belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.

                         I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, 
                         and... and that scroll may be our only 
                         hope!

                         Then, prepare yourself. The time of 
                         trials begins.  Adoramus te, Christe! 
                          I wish you luck, Father. Use all the 
                         strength, agility, and faith that you 
                         have.

                         Very well. Here we go.  Hmmm, there's 
                         a ladder up here.  Oh my God, a rattlesnake! 
                          A way back up!  I've made it! Praise 
                         be to God! He hath shown me the way! 
                          This must be it. The Holy Document 
                         of Vatican Law.

                         Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great 
                         time bein' atheist. I for one can't 
                         believe I used to live my life by what 
                         a very old and very fictional book used 
                         to say.

                         Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch 
                         of stories about people in robes slaughtering 
                         goats have to do with today's world?

                         Atheism has definitely made our lives 
                         better.

                         wants some.

                         And if anybody needs to potty, there's 
                         a potty basket right here. 
 
                                     RICHARD
                         Oh thanks, Sharon.

                         You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're 
                         worried we might have a hard time raising 
                         our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank 
                         you -I mean,  it could end up being 
                         very difficult raising an atheist child 
                         in such a Christian society.  I feel 
                         that everywhere my poor son goes he's 
                         being persecuted for his beliefs. 
 
                         
                                     RICHARD
                         That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son 
                         to be atheist, I don't want him saying 
                         "under God" every day at school. That 
                         could really damage him. "Under God" 
                         should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse 
                         me.  Moowwaaagh.  "Under God" should 
                         be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.
 
                         
                                     RANDY
                          That's right, I agree.  And it should 
                         be taken off of money as well.  The 
                         religious right in this country is trying 
                         to force our children to believe what 
                         they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let 
                         the religious right corrupt our kids.

                         killed our religion.

                         stupid laws and rules!  You've forgotten 
                         what being a Catholic is all about. 
                          This... book. You see, these are just 
                         stories.  Stories that are meant to 
                         help people in the right direction. 
                         Love your neighbor. Be a good person.

                         the stories into literal translations 
                         of hierarchies and power, well... Well,

                         to them! They've lost touch with any 
                         idea of any kind of religion, and when 
                         they have no mythology to try and live 
                         their lives by, well, they just start

                         O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my 
                         butt anymore.

                         Does this mean we have to go to church 
                         on Sundays again?

                         No. It means we get to, son. It means... 
                         we get to.
