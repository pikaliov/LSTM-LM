                         Okay, children, I know that today is 
                         the last day of school, and that the 
                         last day of school involves pranks, 
                         but this is going too far! What have 
                         you done with Mr. Hat?!  Children, I 
                         want Mr. Hat right now!  The prank is 
                         over!  You think I can't get along without 
                         Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't 
                         live without him. Well, I can! He's 
                         just a puppet. I don't need him. You 
                         see? Watch.  GOD DAMMIT, WHERE THE FUCK 
                         DID YOU PUT MR. HAT?!

                         is over, but summer vacation doesn't 
                         start for you little bastards, until 
                         Mr. Hat is back on my desk!

                         I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat 
                         lying right here!  Okay. Now I'm gonna 
                         turn around now.  Shit!

                         with the statewide ban on fireworks, 
                         people from all over Colorado are flocking 
                         to South Park. Here with a special report 
                         is a normal-looking guy with a funny 
                         name.

                         Thanks, Tom, it looks like the firework 
                         ban won't be putting a damper on one 
                         town's festivities tonight. I'm here 
                         at Stark's Pond in South Park, where 
                         the crowd of residents and scores of 
                         tourists anxiously await the lighting 
                         of the largest snake in human history. 
                          Now, as most of you will probably remember, 
                         snakes are these little round disks 
                         that you light, and they spew out a 
                         little snake of black ash. Well, the 
                         South Park snake is over half a mile 
                         in diameter, and twenty stories high. 
                         I'm told that this event won't begin 
                         until the sun goes down and night is 
                         upon us.  Well alrighty then, looks
