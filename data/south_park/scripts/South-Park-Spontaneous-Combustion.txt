                         out the cause of the phenomenon. You

               announcement, along with much of the town]
 
                                     THE MAYOR
                         All right, people. Scientist Marsh and 
                         I have been working very hard on the 
                         problem of spontaneous combustion, and 
                         we have finally come up with a solution. 
                         Mr. Marsh?
 
                                     RANDY
                          The little boy combusted because he 
                         had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the 
                         girl that caused him to combust, it 
                         was the fact that Kenny did not want 
                         to pass gas in front of her.  You see, 
                         as food is digested the natural processes 
                         give off a byproduct known as methane 
                         gas.  The methane gathers here in the 
                         bowel area , where it causes pressure. 
                         Normally a person would expel this byproduct 
                         in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should 
                         the gas not be expelled,  the methane 
                         can build up and then ignite,  leading 
                         to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because 
                         he held his farts in for too long.

                         Boy, they're really pissed.

                         Well, they're right. We should have 
                         known that all that methane could adversely 
                         affect the atmosphere.

                         The spontaneous combustion problem escalates 
                         as more and more peopel go back to holding 
                         in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the 
                         ozone layer continues to deplete as 
                         others refuse to hold in their farts 
                         for fear of combustion. As we all know, 
                         the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, 
                         the son of a bitch who calls himself 
                         a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh 
                         earlier today and he had this to say:

                         It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh,

                         me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. 
                         But then he saw that what mattered most 
                         was everybody else. So he stopped thinking 
                         about his own misery, and did what had 
                         to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, 
                          he raised his hand and said, "The needs 
                         of the many outweigh the needs of the 
                         few."

                         right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like 
                         kind of a good book.

                         You're a dead man, Marsh!

                          Please, just listen to me. I think 
                         I found the answer.

                          Could I borrow one of your rocks?

                         It's all about moderation. If you never 
                         fart, you combust, but if you always 
                         fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must 
                         fart only at appropriate times or when 
                         it's really, really funny.

                         Huh? 

                                     RANDY
                         I know you all hate me, but please, 
                         for your own sake, fart in moderation. 
                         You can keep stoning me now, if you 
                         want.  Ow.

                         And so we salute Randy Marsh and his 
                         unified theory of moderation that has 
                         saved us all.

                         Dude, you survived all this time on 
                         the fat stored up in your body?

                         Yes. And when I get down from here, 
                         I'm gonna kick you both right in the 
                         nuts.
