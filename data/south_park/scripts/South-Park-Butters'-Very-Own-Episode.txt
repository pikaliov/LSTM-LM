                         movie, though, because Dad came out, 
                         like, ten minutes later. ...And it must 
                         have been a sad film, too, because, 
                         he had a bunch of tissue paper with 
                         him when he came out. Poor old Dad, 
                         the movie really got to him.

                         all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, 
                         though. This one black guy had him pinned

                         also times when distorting the truth 
                         a little ih, is appropriate. These are

                         Ya see, sometimes telling a little white 
                         lie is okay. Like, for instance, when 
                         you catch your father jacking off in 
                         a gay men's bath house.

                         that if you told Mommy what Daddy was 
                         doing tonight, weh, she might go completely

                         I can't keep it straight when you keep 
                         inventing new parts to the story!

                         Hey, don't forget that I'm covering 
                         for you! 
 
                                     LINDA
                         Don't forget: your lies started all 
                         this. 
 
                                     CHRIS
                         My lies may have been deceitful, but 
                         your lies cover up something much more 
                         horrible than anything I ever did!

                         Happy Anniversary!

                                     CHRIS
                         Not now, Butters!

                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh.  Alright, then. I-

                         Butters?? Oh, Butters!

                                     CHRIS
                         Son! I don't believe it! 

                                     BUTTERS
                         Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into 
                         the lake, and it floated all the way 
                         down the river. I tried callin' home, 
                         but it was-
 
                                     LINDA
                         Oh, my baby's back!

                                     BUTTERS
                         I ain't grounded, am I?

                                     CHRIS
                         No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... 
                          Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell 
                         a little white lie about where you've 
                         been though, alright?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Lie?

                                     LINDA
                         Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going 
                         to have to say you don't know how you 
                         got home.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican 
                         man dropped you off! 
 
                                     LINDA
                         Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped 
                         him off?!
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                          Now we don't really have a choice, 
                         do we?!
 
                                     LINDA
                         You're the one that made up the stuff 
                         about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.

                                     CHRIS
                         Well you're the one who couldn't back 
                         it up wit a description, stupid!
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! 
                         Now I am sick of these harmless lies 
                         and l-little white lies. You know, you 
                         can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, 
                         but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. 
                         Ah, and you can call a lie whatever 
                         you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' 
                         lie! And when you start coverin' up 
                         one lie with another why, now that's 
                         when you get into real trouble!  Boy 
                         I've, I've just about had it up to here 
                          with you two! 
 
                                     CHRIS
                         ...Butters... You're as right as rain.
 
                         
                                     LINDA
                          You sure are.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' 
                         at ya, am I?
 
                                     LINDA
                         No, Butters. You're the best son in 
                         the whole world.  And I am so happy 
                         you're alive.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         ...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, 
                         Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
 
                         
                                     CHRIS
                         You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have 
                         something they have to do first. 
 
                         
               [Butters' house, day. The news media and the spectators are back 
               at the Stotch house for another press conference.. The front 
               door opens and the Stotches step forth to the podium, all cleaned 
               up and well-dressed. Cameramen begin taking pictures]
 
                                     CHRIS
                         We... have an announcement to make, 
                         um. Our son has been returned to us.

                         Wow, alright

                                     STAN
                         Butters was missing?

                                     CHRIS
                         But, that isn't all we have to say. 
                         You see, we learned a very important 
                         lesson tonight and it took the smarts 
                         of our young son to show us.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          Yeah!

                                     LINDA
                         We've learned that deception is wrong 
                         and that the only thing to ever make 
                         it right again is to come clean.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah! 

                                     CHRIS
                         You see, I've been deceiving my wife 
                         for several months. I was going to gay 
                         movie- and bathhouses and having sex 
                         with random men who were complete strangers.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                          Ye-!  wait, what?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huho!

                                     LINDA
                          And when I found out I went crazy, 
                         I went crazy and I drove my son into 
                         the lake to kill 'im.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!

                                     STAN
                         Damn, dude.

                                     CHRIS
                         So you see, there was no "some Puerto 
                         Rican guy." He doesn't exist. And so 
                         the people we owe the biggest apology 
                         to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, 
                         and O.J. We gave you false hope for 
                         finding the person who hurt those close 
                         to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just 
                         happy we won't have to live a life of 
                         secrets. For I knew that even though 
                         some of you supported us, some others 
                         were looking at me and thinking, "You're 
                         a liar! You're a LIAR!"  "You know somethin' 
                         that you're not telling us, you slimy, 
                         scumbag LIAR!!"  Eh you know, that's 
                         what people would say to me. And then 
                         people would see my wife at the supermarket 
                         and they would say, "Hello," but they'd 
                         be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!" 
                          "You got away with MURDER you murdering, 
                         lying, waste of life!!"  And to me, 
                         people might say things like,  "LIAR! 
                         Tell us what you know you God-damned 
                         LIAR!!"  And so, to both of us, people 
                         all over town would be saying things 
                         like,  "You know God-damn well what 
                         happened to your kid, so stop acting 
                         like victims, and confess, you MURDERING 
                         MURDERERS!!"  "CONFESS!!"  "LIAR!! CONFESS!!" 
                          You know, and, that's what people would 
                         be saying to us, and so, we just had 
                         to come forward and tell the truth.
 
                         
                                     LINDA
                         We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't 
                         happen again.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         And now, if you'll excuse us, this family 
                         has to get to Bennigan's.
 
                                     MAN 2 IN CROWD

                                     STAN
                         Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your 
                         mom tried to kill you.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna 
                         rip on me at school now.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         We sure are.

                                     BUTTERS
                         I really wish I didn't know that stuff. 
                         I guess I learned that sometimes, lying 
                         can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when 
                         I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon 
                         burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about 
                         my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' 
                         to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
 
                                     STAN
                         Really?

                                     BUTTERS
                         Naw, I'm lyin'

                                     CHRIS
                          Let's go, son.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Wuh comin', Dad! 

                                     CHOIR

                                     BUTTERS
                          That's me!
