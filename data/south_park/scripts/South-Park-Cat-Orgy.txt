                         up the heat over here. And if he gets 
                         cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with 
                         him, and make sure he wipes good after 
                         he makes bears.

                         Dude, when my mom finds out that my 
                         babysitters have their boyfriends over, 
                         she mostly gets really mad, mostly. 
                          Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!
 
                                     SHELLEY
                         Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. 
                         There's refreshments 
 
                                     ANNOUNCER
                         And now, back to Wild Animal World
 
                         
                                     HOST
                          Here in the more arid regions of Africa, 
                         the gold-coat lions are in the throes 
                         of mating season.  The male lion positions 
                         himself behind the female and prepares 
                         to insert his lionhood. Notice his large 
                         swollen balls.  The female lion relaxes 
                         her body and says "hello" to Mr. Winky. 
                          The male lion is enticed by the female's 
                         supple breasts and firm backside.  Quickly 
                         and suddenly, the male is finished. 
                         Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly 
                         asks the female to leave. He promises 
                         he'll call her tomorrow. But the female 
                         doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right 
                         in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed.

                         Come on, babe. How long have we known 
                         each other?

                         And I still don't get any action.

                                     SHELLEY
                         I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind 
                         of strange to me that you're 22 and 
                         all.
 
                                     SKYLER
                         But I'm still in high school. I told 
                         you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.

                         Well, maybe just one kiss.

                         a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild 
                         Wild West techniques and get proof that 
                         Shelley had a boyfriend over.

                         down! Here, I'll get you some catnip.

                          Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the 
                         best of its kind, and not a scratch 
                         on it.

                         I can't help it. I see your pretty lips 
                         and I want to kiss them.

                         I am putting this picture of the babysitter 
                         and her boyfriend on your collar.  You 
                         have to take this picture to Mommy, 
                         Kitty, so that she can come home and 
                         save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this 
                         picture to Mommy, and lead her back 
                         here. When you return, be sure to bring 
                         Mom in through the back door. Hurry,

                         I opened the door because Mr. Kitty 
                         is on his way right now to my mom's 
                         party with the picture!

                         why I went outside and got him!

                         from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote 
                         a letter to the press! To be opened 
                         in the case of my demise! Should anything 
                         happen to me, that letter will go out, 
                         and you will never find it!
