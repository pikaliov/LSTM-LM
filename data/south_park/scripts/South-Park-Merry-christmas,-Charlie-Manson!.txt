                         I'm sorry, Stanley. I can't let you 
                         go all the way to Nebraska by yourself.

                         me a biiig present, for no reason, except 
                         that I'm cool.

                          Mass murderer and extremely nasty person 
                         Charles Manson has escaped from prison! 
                         Manson was the man responsible for seven 
                         murders in the late '60's. Manson has 
                         never shown any signs of remorse for 
                         his crimes. If you see Manson, please 
                         kick his ass and smash his fucking face 
                         in for me, and then call the police.

                         What??

                                     MANSON
                          I can never make it up to the families 
                         that I destroyed, but at least I'll 
                         make an example for anyone else thinking 
                         that crime  is an answer.

                         Stop that. 

                                     MANSON
                         You see, I get it now! I finally understand 
                         what the holidays are all about. Boys, 
                         don't you see? You can't let things 
                         get you down during the holidays, because 
                         being happy is what the holidays are 
                         all about!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some 
                         fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
 
                         
                                     MANSON
                         I've been such a bastard all these years, 
                         and I finally understand. And it it 
                         it feals great! I'f I feel like, I feel 
                         like I'm in my own Christmas special. 
                         You see,
 
               
               Holidays are that special time

               When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy

               Forget about being angry for a day

               Remember how it felt to be a child

               Opening presents on Christmas mornin'

               That's the way that we should all feel now

               
               So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy

               Holidays

                                     EVERYONE ELSE
                         Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy 
                         happy
 
               Holidays

                                     MANSON
                         Happy Kwanzaa, too.

               From me, to you.

               
               Happy Holidays, you guys.

                         Happy Holidays, Bob.

                         Happy Holidays, Chief.

                                     CHIEF STEVENS
                         Come on, Manson. You belong in jail 
                         
 
                                     MANSON
                         You're darn right I do.

                                     HOWARD
                          Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and 
                         Dad. I hope you can forgive me.
 
                                     GRANDMA
                         Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It 
                         was nice of you to pop in for the holidays.
 
                         
                                     GRANDPA
                         Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, 
                         son.
 
                                     HOWARD
                         I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for 
                         all your help.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being 
                         such a great role model for me.  Piece 
                         of crap!
 
                                     STAN
                         I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.

                         Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole 
                         thing and have a nice holiday back home.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         Really??

                                     RANDY
                         Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?

                          And so, Manson is hauled off to jail 
                         to rot in his cell. Everything is back 
                         to normal, and I guess the only thing 
                         left to say is, God bless us, every 
                         one.

                          And I guess that's what I've learned. 
                         I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't 
                         make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. 
                         All I hope is that I don't make mankind 
                         lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers 
                         in the world. There's rapists and thieves. 
                         But those are the vast minority. The 
                         majority of mankind is made up of caring 
                         people, who try every day to do what 
                         they think is right. And that's the 
                         spirit of the season. What do you think, 
                         guys?

                         It sucks, just like all your other books.

                         Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy 
                         Holidays.
