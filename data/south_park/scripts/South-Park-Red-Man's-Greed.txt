                         Well, I guess we all learned that South 
                         Park is more than just a town. It's 
                         a community that nobody can split up.

                         Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and 
                         do the guest voice thingy.

                         Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Joe!
