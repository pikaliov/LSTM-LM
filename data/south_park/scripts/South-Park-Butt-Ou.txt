                         one of the country's largest exports.

                         the tobacco business was so great that

                          Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, 
                         many of our black friends wouldn't be 
                         here today.

                          And so for centuries, tobacco production 
                         flourished. Nobody was even aware of 
                         any dangers back then, until, in 1965, 
                          when Congress passed an act forcing 
                         all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon 
                         General's warning on their packages. 
                         So now, everyone knows the dangers of 
                         smoking. And some people still choose 
                         to do it, and we believe that's what 
                         being an American is all about.

                         there's no proof that second-hand smoke 
                         kills. I've just been diagnosed with 
                         terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm 
                         the proof. The next time you want to 
                         believe that second-hand smoke doesn't 
                         kill, think about me. Because, by the 
                         time you see this commercial, I'll be... 
                         dead.  Dead??

                         people. That was fantastic.

                         be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that 
                         "dead" part?

                         It has... sprinkles.

                          Eric, do you know what a hero is? A 
                         hero is somebody who sacrifices himself 
                         for the good of others. Youc an be a 
                         hero, Eric. All you have to do... is 
                         eat the cupcake.

                         the tobacco company.

                          Oh all right.

                                     KYLE
                         No! What we really should do is go to 
                         our parents right now and take responsibility 
                         for smoking ourselves. Even if it means 
                         getting grounded.
 
                                     STAN
                         Why?

                                     KYLE
                         Because, if we go to the tobacco company, 
                         I know exactly what'll happen. They'll 
                         take us in, and then Rob Reiner will 
                         show up with all the townspeople, holding 
                         torches or something, and there'll be 
                         a big showdown until we talk about what 
                         we learned, and change everyone's minds 
                         - this is all following a formula!
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         So it's either deal with all that, or 
                         be grounded for three weeks.
