                         I see... a man... with a baseball cap. 
                          He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing 
                         it all flash before my eyes! The guy's 
                         name is Michael Deets, and he lives 
                         at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually

                         I don't know. How do we know this kid 
                         is really psychic? I mean, this boy 
                         is certainly no Eric Cartman.

                         out. But let's use that one thing that 
                         we never use.

                         You know, what's that one thing that 
                         starts with an R that we never use?

                         we could take a quick look around your

                         it might help us with an investigation.

                         This isn't the guy. The serial killer 
                         always cuts off the victims' left hands.

                         on your left hand, the thumb faces to 
                         the left. Those are all right hands.

                         Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was

                         in there just didn't feel right.  Wait 
                         a minute.

               to the keyboard. He then goes to the lab and looks over his notes. 
               Next to him are two hands, one right and one left. He rotates 
               the right hand so both thumbs point to the left, from his POV, 
               then takes more notes. He develops some pictures in the darkroom 
               and finds matching hands. He works with a 3D model drawing with 
               another computer, then traces his left hand on a wall and takes 
               measurements. He returns to the lab and works with some chemicals. 
               Next he chops some firewood into smaller chunks. Next he's at 
               a gym jumping rope. Next he's at a beach far from South Park 
               playing volleyball with some women. Next he's repairing the body

                         Not only did your psychic visions help 
                         us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent

                         Eric.

                         No, don't you see? Cartman never had 
                         psychic visions. And neither do these 
                         people. The plain simple truth is that 
                         nobody is psychic. There's a logical 
                         explanation for every psychic story

                         It must be true. The kid is psychic. 
                          But I don't suppose it really matters 
                         much. Because in the end, the way I 
                         caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned 
                         police work. Come on, Murphy.

                         one score to settle.
