                         Thanks for having us all over for dinner, 
                         Chris and Linda.

                         Yes, it was fabulous.

                                     LINDA
                         Oh, we're just really happy that your 
                         boys have become such good friends with 
                         our little Butters.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Yeah. We figure that if our boys are 
                         goona be great friends, we should all 
                         get to be friends, too.

                         Well, our boys do seem to be spending 
                         a lot of time together lately. I think 
                         ever since their friend Kenny died they've 
                         been looking for someone to fill the 
                         void.
 
                                     CHRIS
                         Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. 
                         It's nice that he finally has your sons 
                         to be his best buddies!

                         Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? 
                          When someone's sleeping, you can take 
                         a glass of warm water,  and you put 
                         their hand in it...

                          Yeah, and then what?

                         And then, you pee on it!  heheh, heheheheheheheh.

                         No, dude, you're supposed to put their 
                         hand in warm water and it makes them 
                         pee.

                         And we were thinking, since they've 
                         all become such close friends, how great 
                         it would be for us to all go together 
                         to Aspen for a ski weekend.

                         that.

                         No, you see, Linda and I found this 
                         ad where you can get two night free 
                         at a condo in Aspen if you attend a 
                         time-share presentation..

                         Yes! And all we have to do is attend 
                         a thirty-minute meeting!

                         So last night, while Butters was asleep, 
                         I gave him a Hitler.

                         and you put your finger up your butt 
                         and then, wipe it on their upper lip 
                         to give them a little Hitler mustache? 
                         You've never Hitlered anyone?

                         out here, too. I'm starting to think 
                         this whole town smells like doodoo.

                         you out here. My name is Thumper, and 
                         I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor.

                         We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, 
                         make sure everybody has a goood time. 
                         'Cause what is skiing about? Having 
                         a good...?  Tiime, that's right. Now, 
                         just a few safety things to keep in 
                         mind: First of all, look straight ahead 
                         when you ski. You look down, you're 
                         gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad 
                         time. Also, be aware of skiers around 
                         you. You run into another skier, your 
                         skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad 
                         time.

                         So where's the part where we have a 
                         good time?
 
                                     THUMPER
                         Hey, little dude, you got some crap 
                         right here. 
 
                                     BUTTERS

                         Alright, we're gonna do this without 
                         any poles until we know our two primary 
                         feet positions. To go slow, we wedge

                         a slice... of pizza. Then to go faster, 
                         we put 'em parallel, like... French 
                         fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French 
                         fries,  Pizza,  French fries.

                         And so, we think we can convince you 
                         to buy one of our combos that's opening 
                         right here in Phase 4.

                         opportunity!

                         I I'm sorry, but none of us can really 
                         afford to own our own vacation condo.

                         Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing 
                         this meeting because of the two nights 
                         free deal.
 
                                     PHIL
                         Oh, I know, that's what everybody says 
                         - "Not me, I can't afford it." But what 
                         if I told you you could own one of our 
                         properties for only eight thousand dollars?

                         For only eight thousand dollars we can 
                         buy a condo here?
 
                                     PHIL
                         Well you see, "time-share" means you 
                         buy the condo with about twenty other 
                         people like yourselves  You  "share" 
                         the condo with other investors and pick 
                         the  "time" you want to stay.
 
                                     JOSH
                          Share,  time.  Time share.

                         So then it's not really ours.

                         Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a 
                         half yours! You see, time-share has 
                         made it possible for even working-class 
                         people like you to say, "I've got a 
                         little place in Aspen."
 
                                     JOSH
                         Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little 
                         place in Aspen."

                         I've got a little place in Aspen.

                         Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say 
                         guys, how'd you like to tell that hot 
                         secretary "I've got a nice little place 
                         in Aspen"? Hahaha. Just kidding, wives.

                          Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. 
                         We'd like to go hit the slopes now?

                         time-share luncheon. We did give you 
                         a free condo for the weekend.
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Well your ad said we only had to attend 
                         a thirty-minute meeting.
 
                                     PHIL
                         R-right, but this isn't that meeting. 
                         The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't 
                         worry, you're gonna have a great free 
                         meal at the luncheon.

                         some say you can still see their ghosts 
                         up there. It was on that very ski run

                         by a wolfboy who escaped from a mental 
                         institution. You see, that ski run was

                         wichicaw who ate the flesh of children

                         Come on, Stan! 

                                     TAD
                          Haha.  This shoud slow down Darsh a 
                         bit!

                          And it looks like Tad is way out in 
                         front.
 
                                     TAD
                          Now I'll win for sure!

                                     KYLE
                         Awgh, dude, I can't look. 

                                     TAD
                         

               Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! [leaves. 
               Stan continues his run. Tad returns with more sand and pours 
               it out]
 
               He doesn't stand a chance, now! [Stan reaches the fallen tree 
               and climbs over it, then continues his run. Tad pours out even 
               more sand]
 
               I'm gonna beat 'im! [tosses the bucket away and leaves]

                                     ANNOUNCER
                          The race is half over and Tad is still 
                         out in the lead! 
 
                                     TAD
                         Huh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let 
                         all these hamsters go. That should distract 
                         him just long enough for me to win the 
                         race!
 
                                     TEEN GIRL
                          Oh Tad.

                                     TAD
                         ...What are you doing up here?

                                     TEEN GIRL
                         Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract 
                         you. With these. 
 
                                     KYLE
                         Good job, dude!

                                     STAN
                         Thanks. 

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         You did it, Stan! 

                                     TEEN GIRL
                         Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna 
                         be able to keep the youth center.

                         Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits 
                         of the Wakachaw Indians can finally 
                         rest in peace.

                          Stan, I was wrong about you. Would 
                         you like to go out again? 
 
                                     TEEN GIRL
                         Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you 
                         ever wanted.

                                     STAN
                         Where the hell have you guys been?!

                         Uh we got a little held up at the time-share 
                         sales office.
 
                                     RANDY
                         Yeah, but the good news is we finally 
                         came to our senses and bought some shares 
                         in a condo. So we all get to come to 
                         Aspen for two weeks every year!
 
                                     THE BOYS
                          Awwwwww!

                                     CHRIS
                         What's the matter? Didn't you boys like 
                         skiing? 
 
                                     STAN
                         No! We can't keep track of when you 
                         pizza and when you French-fries and 
                         when the hot-shot asshole skier takes 
                         your girl or if you're supposed to race 
                         him the first time or train first to 
                         beat him on the really difficult mountain 
                         so you can save the dorky but hot girl's 
                         youth center. Skiing sucks! 
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, what a stupid sport! 

                                     THUMPER
                          I heard that you were the one responsible 
                         for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
 
                         
                                     TEEN GIRL

                         saw these.
