                         Hold still, Ike! We have to get you 
                         dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?

                         I don't kow. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna 
                         be late for Jew Scouts!

               set, and hums. Both he and Kyle have little pigtails hanging

                         (Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the 
                         meteor shower. Do you wanna come and 
                         see it with me?)

                         I can't watch the meteor shower with 
                         you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.

                                     KYLE
                         It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually 
                         we just sit around and make stuff. But 
                         tonight, because there's a meteor shower, 
                         we're gonna do some big thing out in 
                         the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm 
                         sure.

                         Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then 
                         it won't suck so hard.
 
                                     KENNY

                         Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
 
                         
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         ...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a 
                         ...special thing.
 
                                     KYLE
                         ...Oh. Kenny isn't special?

                                     KENNY
                         (Aw.)

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         No, no, you're very special, Kenny. 
                         It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for 
                         Jewish kids. 
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special 
                         group that borrows a little bit from 
                         all different Jewish denominations. 
                         From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic 
                         Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... 
                         But you have to believe the basic tenets 
                         of Judaism to be a Scout.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Kenny'll believe whatever you want him 
                         to.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Kyle, eh, the problem is-

                                     KYLE
                         Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has 
                         anywhere else to be tonight.
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Oh, all right. Just don't let any of 
                         the elders know that he isn't Jewish, 
                         okay?

                         Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         You have to be in Squirts if you're 
                         too young to be a Jew Scout.
 
                                     KENNY
                         (Oh.)

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in 
                         on our faith on the way up there.

                         And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore 
                         him no children. She had a handmaid, 
                         an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And 
                         Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, 
                         the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. 
                         I pray thee, go into my maid."

                         Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then 
                         said to kill. But that was just a little 
                         silly trick to see if Abraham would 
                         do it.

                         and so was I. You have to go so someday 
                         you can be a big brave Jew Scout.

                         Yeah.  Actually, we saw a bear a few 
                         miles back.

                         Nothing to worry about, though. Your

                         earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend

                         We've learned a lot from you and your 
                         great friend, Kenny.
 
                                     MOSES
                          Every year we shall gather here in 
                         this special place and bring Kenny tidings 
                         of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.

                         Yes.

                                     MOSES
                         And those little shaker things where... 
                         you put beans inside of paper plates 
                         that are glued together.
 
                                     ELDER HARRIS
                         Paper-plate bean shakers.

                                     MOSES
                         And let us put patterns of glue on the 
                         outside of those paper plates so we 
                         can then pour glitter on them so they 
                         can look nice and sparkly.
 
                                     ELDER SCHWARTZ
                         You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to 
                         work!
