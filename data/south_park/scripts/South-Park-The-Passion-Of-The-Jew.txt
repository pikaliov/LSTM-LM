                         out there on the planet surface, don't 
                         hold me responsible.

                         The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in 
                         the movie, Jews are the Devil!

                         thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't 
                         seen it once! There's even one part 
                         where the Jews have a chance to save 
                         Jesus, and you know what they do? They 
                         let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free 
                         instead and laugh about it.

                         about The Passion! I'm out of here.

                         You're scared of the truth. You don't 
                         want that movie to show you just how 
                         bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates 
                         you.

                         that movie. I guess... we have to ge 
                         see it too.

                         dollars. Do you know how we can get 
                         in touch with him?

                         You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, 
                         you don't understand what Mel Gibson 
                         was trying to do! He was trying to express, 
                         through cinema, the horror and filthiness 
                         of the common Jew. It has made people 
                         the world over open their eyes.

                         bad movie, so tell us how to get in 
                         touch with Mel Gibson so we can get 
                         our money back!

                         at this very moment, sir. All I know 
                         is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now

                         Oh I agree. There are so many of us 
                         who are moved by The Passion. It's a 
                         perfect idea to have us organize so 
                         we can strengthen the Christian community.

                         an eight year old boy who was touched 
                         by the film.

                         Ah hello everyone. Achtung.  My name 
                         is Eric Cartman and I'm the President 
                         of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank 
                         you, thank you. I'm happy to see that 
                         all of you.were affected by The Passion 
                         like I was. Now, we all know why we're 
                         here, and I believe we all what needs 
                         to be done.

                         But, I think it's best we don't talk 
                         out loud about it until we have most 
                         of them on the trains heading to the 
                         camps.

                         I'm not sure, but-uh.  Folks, I just 
                         wanna interrupt for a second and say 
                         how remarkable it is that this little 
                         boy brought us all together. The Passion 
                         is causing a revolution of spirituality, 
                         and we owe Mel Gibson and this little 
                         boy our thanks.

                         in order to do what we  all know needs 
                         to be done, we are first going to need 
                         more support. I think we should all 
                         go out and take at least one other person 
                         to see The Passion.

                         And so it was that God sent his only

                         sins.

                         Right. But he can't live with the guilt 
                         anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't 
                         really the Son of God, he was still 
                         a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what 
                         happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie.

                         Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The 
                         truth is, there's not a whole lot in 
                         the Bible about the Crucifixion. The 
                         Passion was actually done as a performance 
                         piece back in the Middle Ages to incite 
                         people against the Jews.

                         friend's soul, then perhaps show him 
                         the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity 
                         is about... atonement.

                         our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, 
                         has asked if he could speak to the congragation.

                         Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United 
                         States officially issued an apology 
                         to the African American community for 
                         slavery. In 1956, Germany officially 
                         apologized for World War II AND the 
                         Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, 
                         the Jewish community needs to apologize 
                         for the death of Jesus.

                         to torture me, then just give me my 
                         eighteen dollars!
 
                                     STAN
                         It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie 
                         sucked!
 
                                     MEL
                         You can't say my movie sucked, or else 
                         you're saying Christianity sucked!
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, 
                         that's cool, but, you should follow 
                         what Jesus taught instead of how he 
                         got killed. Focusing on how he got killed 
                         is what people did in the Dark Ages 
                         and it ends up with really bad results.

                         You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't 
                         focus our faith on the torture and execution 
                         of Christ.

                         Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in 
                         those times. We shouldn't rely on violence 
                         to inspire faith.

                         Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so 
                         close to completing my final solution!
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Oh, dude, I feel so much better about 
                         being Jewish now that I see that Mel 
                         Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
 
                         
                                     MEL
                         Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo!
