                         Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for 
                         JIMMY!  Thank you! Wow. What a terrific 
                         audience.  I know what most of you are 
                         thinking. "Hey, uh-that guy stole my 
                         show..."  Wow, what a great audience. 
                         And how about this Michael Jackson guy, 
                         huh? I mean, come on...  Wow, what a 
                         great audience.  Uh... l... lights, 
                         please?

                         Hey Jimmy.

                                     JIMMY
                         Butters, w-where is everybody?

                         Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher 
                         Reeve came to town to do some kind of 
                         show, and everyone went to see him.
 
                         
                                     JIMMY
                         Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy 
                         who played Superman.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         I know who he is! But why is everyone 
                         ditching my comedy show to see him?!
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Ww-well, because he got crippled, but 
                         now he can move his finger. He is an 
                         inspiration to us all. That's why everyone 
                         ditched on your show.

                         Though it is controversial,  stem cell 
                         research is critical  in the quest for 
                         helping  the disabled.

                         more important than us that were born 
                         that way, very much.

                         All right. Chris, the whole world is 
                         waiting. Why don't you show us what 
                         stem-cell research has done for you. 
                          Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? 
                         Now, Chris, there're some people who 
                         say stem-cell research is wrong, that 
                         takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.

                         Well, it just proves that the public 
                         needs to be educated  about stem-cell 
                         research. See, the stem cells from a 
                         fetus like this one  can form into whatever 
                         cells of the body are damaged. They 
                         are the most powerful thing on the planet.
 
                         
                                     KING
                         And how does someone like yourself make 
                         use of the stem cells, Chris?

                         Well, it's very simple.  And now you 
                         can see, my arms have better movement.

                          Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher 
                         Reeve had a horrible accident and was 
                         paralyzed. The irony, of course, is 
                         that the man who played Superman could 
                         no longer walk. America watched in wonder 
                         as he managed to move one of his fingers, 
                         then his arms. And now, seen for the 
                         first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve 
                         is going to lift a truck up over his 
                         head.

                         strength.

                         I guess we could at least give havin' 
                         fun together a try. It's like  Come

                                     BUFF CRIP
                         I've gotta give you two dawgs props 
                         for puttin' an end to all this hate.
 
                         
                                     JIMMY
                         I told you, lock-ins at the rec center 
                         always work. And you know, I've learned 
                         something, too. I was player-hatin' 
                         Christopher Butthole Reeve because he 
                         got more attention than me. But just 
                         like... y-you guys, I need to learn 
                         to control my a... anger.
 
                                     BLOOD
                         Right on!

                                     CRIP
                          Hey little Roller, try some of this 
                         chronic shit.
 
                                     TIMMY
                         Timmih! 

                                     JIMMY
                         I guess we all learned that trying to 
                         get along is way better than p... player 
                         hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about 
                         it. Why don't we listen in?
 
                                     GANG MEMBERS
                         It used to be that Crips and Bloods 
                         didn't get along,
 
               But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song.

               Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love.
 
               
               Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.

                         Man! I will be back!!

                         Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of 
                         that one.

                         Mee tooo.
