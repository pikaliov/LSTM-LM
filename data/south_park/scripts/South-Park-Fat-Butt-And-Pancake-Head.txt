               [South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is speaking to the school in 
               the school gym, which is nicely decorated in the flags of many 
               nations, both on the rafters and on the small stage set up at 
               one end of the basketball court.]

                          And in conclusion, the Latino community 
                         has provided America, and indeed, the 
                         entire world with innovations that we 
                         would be lost without. And that is my 
                         presentation on the role of Hispanics 
                         in American technology. Thank you.

                          That was very good, Kyle. I think the 
                         Latino Endowment Council was very happy 
                         with your presentation. Looks like you 
                         might win.

                         All right, students, members of the 
                         school board. Our last speaker will 
                         discuss the important role of Latinos 
                         in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.

                         like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy 
                         on the outside, so super good and yummy.
