               [South Park Elementary playrgound, recess or lunch. The camera 
               pans across the playground and settles on two teams of seven 
               players each. A football lies on the ground between the two groups. 
               The group left of the football consists of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, 
               Kenny, Butters, Token, and Clyde. The second includes Craig, 
               Tweek, Kevin, Pip, and three others]

                         I'll hike the ball on the third "set 
                         hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post 
                         out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle.

                          Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I 
                         do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy 
                         for weeks.
 
                                     BEBE
                         She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. 
                         She said she still wants to be friends.

                         Just get out of our football game, you

                         breaks up!  Stan?

                          Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
                         
 
               [Stan is next seen walking onto a small red stone bridge. The 
               next scene has him walking down the middle of a two-lane road 
               in the rain. He stops to take in the moist air. The next scene 
               has him back on the bridge, looking over the creek with his head 
               on his right hand. On the water he sees a reflection of Wendy 
               walk up to him. She's smiling. He brightens as she approaches. 
               He turns to greet her, but there's no one to greet. He looks 
               back at the creek, then turns around and walks off. The next 
               scene has him at a rainy night sitting on the curb in a run-down 
               part of town, under a working street light, with his face buried 
               in his legs, crying. The last scene has him in his room, sitting 
               on the floor by his bed, looking at a picture of Wendy. He gently 
               strokes the picture, which has Wendy holding a daisy and smiling 
               broadly. On the picture are written the words "I love you forever. 
               Wendy." The image fades to black]
 
               [South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway Craig goes to a drinking 
               fountain for a drink of water. Fosse and Dog Poo walk towards 
               the camera. Stan is at the far end watching Wendy open her locker. 
               Stan looks away and walks towards Kyle, who's seated next to 
               his locker reading a book.]

                         chance to make things work. Please,

                         wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. 
                         I've been wanting to break up for a 
                         while. but it's, it's nothing against

                         It's like, you always hear songs about 
                         a broken heart and you think it's just 
                         a figure of speech? But it's true. My 
                         chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking 
                         feeling where my heart is. It's broken...

                         other girls out there. I say we take

                         Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, 
                         so I wanna go over the basics with you.

                         First of all, there's a five foot rule. 
                         If you come within five feet of a customer, 
                         you need to acknowledge them, even if 
                         they're not at your table. "Hey, cudie." 
                          When you're not serving food or talking 
                         with customers, you need to dance around 
                         and have fun.  We use things like Hula 
                         Hoops, silly strings, and water guns 
                         to play with the other girls. Be sure 
                         to giggle a lot, and be sure to show 
                         off your raisins.  Now, when you take 
                         a customer's order, you need to sit 
                         down at the table with them and make 
                         them think you're interested. Write 
                         your name down for them and make them 
                         feel special. "Oh man, I am so bored.

                         want good tips, the most important thing 
                         is physical contact. Just a simple hold 
                         of the arm can mean the difference between 
                         five and twenty dollars. "I'll be right

                         Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my 
                         girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', 
                         Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as 
                         a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked 
                         against us, but we're gonna give it 
                         our best shot! And so, if you can't 
                         be happy for us, y-you can just go to 
                         heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. 
                         I'm movin' out of my parents' house 
                         and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's 
                         blow this joint!
 
                                     LEXUS
                         What are you talking about, kid? We 
                         are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         ... What? Lexus, what are you saying? 
                         Are you saying... you don't want to 
                         be together anymore?
 
                                     LEXUS
                         I'm sorry, sweetie.

                                     BUTTERS
                         So that's it? We're broken up now?
 
                         
                                     LEXUS
                         I gotta get these curly fries to Table 
                         12. 
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't 
                         say anything more. There's nothing left 
                         to say. It's over.  Our relationship 
                         is o-over.
 
               [Run-down part of town, night. The conditions surrounding Stan's 
               presence there a week ago are present again, and Butters sobs 
               at the same spot Stan did, at the curb under a working street 
               light. Some shadows move in on him and stop when they cover most 
               of his head]

                         Look at this. Another tortured soul. 
                         Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check 
                         it out. 
 
                                     STAN
                         Butters?

                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.

                                     STAN
                         What's the matter with you?

                                     BUTTERS
                          Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up 
                         with me.
 
                                     HENRIETTA
                         Did she step on your heart with stiletto 
                         heels?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah.  It sure does hurt.

                                     GOTH 2
                         That's cool. I guess you can join up 
                         with us if you want.
 
                                     GOTH 1
                         Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard 
                         and write poems about death and how 
                         pointless life is.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.

                                     STAN
                         Huh? But you just got dumped

                                     BUTTERS
                         Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the 
                         same time I'm really happy that somethin' 
                         could make me feel that sad. It's like, 
                         ih ih, ih it makes me feel alive, you 
                         know? It makes me feel human. And the 
                         only way I could feel this sad now is 
                         if I felt somethin' really good before. 
                         So I have to take the bad with the good, 
                         so I guess what I'm feelin' is like 
                         a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds 
                         stupid...
 
                                     GOTH 1
                         Yeah.

                                     STAN
                         No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound 
                         stupid at all.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well, thanks for offerin' to let me 
                         in your clique, guys, uh but, to be 
                         honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little 
                         pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see 
                         ya, Stan. 
 
                                     STAN
                         He's right. I don't even know who I 
                         am anymore. I like liking life a whole 
                         lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, 
                         I'm goin' home. 
 
                                     GOTH 2
                         Go ahead and go back to your sunshine 
                         fairytale!
 
               [South Park Elementary, playground. The school kids are back 
               at play. The same two teams face off, except that Bill has replaced 
               Token on Stan's team, and Stan hasn't arrived yet]
 
                                     KYLE
                          Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody 
                         make a play!

                          Hey, can I join in? 

                                     KYLE
                         What happened? Aren't you still wallowing 
                         in pain?
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I 
                         just realized that there's gonna be 
                         a lot of painful times in life, so, 
                         I'd better learn to deal with it the 
                         right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. 
                         Token?  Right here, buddy.

                         Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have 
                         you back.
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah. Let's play ball.

               THE END
