               [Cartman's room, day. Cartman and Kyle stand inside watchng Stan, 
               who is peeking out the door, waiting for someone]
 
                                     STAN
                          Okay, here he comes. 

                                     KYLE
                         Who wants to tell him?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'll do it.

                                     BUTTERS
                          Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called 
                         me. There was a pie-eating contest down 
                         at the firehouse, and I thought we should 
                         all go.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Butters, could you take a seat, please?
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Wuh well, sure. 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Butters, we have to have a very difficult 
                         conversation.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Wull what is it?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, in the, in the months since our 
                         friend Kenny died, you've really stepped 
                         up as a friend and "filled the gap." 
                         
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' 
                         you guys' new friend.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working 
                         out.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Nnnot working out?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you 
                         go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Lame

                                     CARTMAN
                         Lane, yes.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Well, but ah I can get better.

                                     STAN
                         Butters, you just don't really fit in 
                         with us here. We think it's best for 
                         all of us if you for friendship opportunites 
                         elsewhere.
 
                                     KYLE
                         But we certainly want to thank you for 
                         all your hard work and attempts at being 
                         our friend, lame as they were.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' 
                         along... great. Heh ah I thought we 
                         were really havin' fun together.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes, well, we weren't.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.

                                     KYLE
                         We're sorry Butters.  Our mind is made 
                         up.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          But we certainly wanna thank you for 
                         coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
                         
 
                                     KYLE
                         Phew.

                                     STAN, CARTMAN
                         Phew.

                                     KYLE
                         Hm, I think he took that pretty well, 
                         I think.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Who cares?

                                     STAN
                         All right, so let's get started on who's 
                         gonna be the new person to take Kenny's 
                         place.
 
               [Butters' house, night. A thunderstorm hovers over the neighborhood. 
               Inside Butters' room a hamster set is seen, and beyond, Butters 
               standing on his bed, looking out his window. He has an angry 
               expression on his face]
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          The world isn't fair. I do everything 
                         people ask me to. I stand in the lunch 
                         line for them, I buy tampons at the 
                         store for them, I go on Maury Povich 
                         with balls on my chin for them.  And 
                         yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. 
                         A shadow of a man who can find no companion... 
                         ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If 
                         I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm 
                         through doin' what others tell me to 
                         do, and I am sick of this world and 
                         the stin-, and the stinky people in 
                         it!  From now on I will dedicate my 
                         life to bringing chaos to the world 
                         that has rejected me!  I will become 
                         the greatest supervillain  the world 
                         has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction 
                         will follow! 
 
               [Butters goes about making a suit for himself. He begins with 
               a sheet of aluminum foil and shapes it around a styrofoam head 
               to make a helmet. He pulls out a shirt from the closet and makes 
               it a cape using a sewing machine. Pretty soon, he's finished 
               - he's dressed as something of a knight]
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for 
                         the greatest supervillain you've ever 
                         seen! Professor Chaos! 
 
                                     LINDA
                          Butters, time for bed.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep 
                         for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
                         
 
               [South Park, morning. A small stage is shown in Cartman'ss backyard, 
               with a camera off to the side. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up 
               on stage and look out over the backyard]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          All right, we wanna thank everybody 
                         for coming. This is a great turnout. 
                          Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died 
                         a few months ago and we are still looking 
                         to fill the void with a new friend. 
                         Now, you've all been selected as possible 
                         candidates, but unfortunately, there 
                         is only room for one of you. So Stan 
                         and Kyle and I will be spending the 
                         next few days going out with each one 
                         of you and narrowing our choices down. 
                         Until we think we've found the perfect 
                         friend. Are there any questions?
 
                                     CLYDE
                          ...What if we don't want to be your 
                         friend?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing 
                         we have to do is cut the list down from 
                         twenty choices to ten. And so today 
                         we will all be going to the amusement 
                         park together to see who we want to 
                         cut. Please keep in mind that this will 
                         all be videotaped, so put on your best 
                         friend faces, and may the best friend 
                         win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten 
                         dollar per person entrance fee.
 
               [South Park, later. The camera looks at the end of Main Street, 
               and Butters comes over a bump on the street. He heads towards 
               the camera right in the middle of the street as the adults around 
               him talk or window-shop. He walks on, and a Bennigan's appears 
               to his left. He turns to look at it, then runs through the front 
               doors. He stops just inside. The diners go about eating and chatting. 
               A waitress serves a table]
 
                                     BENNIGAN'S CHEF
                         Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order 
                         twenty-four is up. 
 
               [Butters sees the dishes and walks up to them. He stares at them 
               for a few seconds, then switches them, grinning evilly. He then 
               drops down quickly as a waitress comes for the dishes. She delivers 
               them to the two diners who ordered them]
 
                                     MAN 1
                         Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered 
                         the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.
 
                         
                                     MAN 2
                         Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here. 
                         
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         I am Professor Chaos, and now, this 
                         puny world uhwill bow down to me! 
 
                         
               [Montage 1 - A Day At The Amusement Park.]

                                     STAN
                          So today we went to the amusement park 
                         with all our possible friends.  It was 
                         a really fun time. We rode all the rides 
                         and everyone got along great.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          I think the person that stood out most 
                         at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
 
                         
                                     JIMMY
                          Well, the, the reason I think I would 
                         make the perfect foreh- friend, is that 
                         I love telling jokes. You know, who 
                         doesn't like to laugh?
 
                                     KYLE
                          Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. 
                         Tweek has a lot of qualities that I 
                         look for in a friend.
 
                                     TWEEK
                          What if they don't pick me? What if 
                         they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! 
                         If they can get to the Pentagon, then 
                         they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
 
                         
                                     DOG POO
                          I think I deserve to take Kenny's place 
                         the most, because, I've been hanging 
                         around these guys for like five years 
                         and I never get to say or do anything.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         ...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in 
                         class, but he never does anything. He's 
                         more like a prop. 
 
                                     KYLE
                          Towelie is a tough choice because, 
                          even though I can see how always having 
                         a towel around can come in handy, he's 
                         just always so high.
 
                                     TOWELIE
                          Man, I really hope I win, because... 
                         wait... why is this again? I have no

                         We decided to get some one-on-one time 
                         with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The 
                         great thing was that, because Jimmy's 
                         crippled, we got to go to the front 
                         of the line.  That was definitely big 
                         points for Jimmy, you know, but, but 
                         then we got to the ride itself, and...
 
                         
                                     JIMMY
                          Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting 
                         in the log, fellas.

                          Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some 
                         points.

                         have a retard for a friend, I, I have 
                         to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't 
                         tell any jokes.
 
                                     JIMMY
                          Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we 
                         great pals or what?

                         got the wrong soup. I love bringing

                         All right, everyone. It was a tough 
                         decision, but based on our time with 
                         you all at the amusement park, we have 
                         whittled our choices down to ten.  If 
                         you receive a rose, please stay. If

                          It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear 
                         about what's been goin' on? Some horrible 
                         new supervillain made somebody get the

                         to get some breakfast.

                          Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal 
                         media! They're keeping the stories of 
                         my deads covered up, so as not to cause 
                         a panic. Well, I guess it's time to

                         All right, children, before we get started, 
                         has anybody seen the eraser for the 
                         chalkboard?  It probably got knocked 
                         on the floor somewhere. Can you all 
                         just please look around your desks for 
                         it?

                          Yes. Look around for your precious 
                         eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's 
                         in my back yard, buried three feet below 
                         the surface of the earth.  And do you 
                         even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all 
                         see how you all like your dear chalkboard 
                         without an eraser.  And information, 
                         it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, 
                         until your minuscule brains can take 
                         it no longer!

                         a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today

                         Now, whenever we multiply a number times 
                         five, the result is going to end in 
                         a zero or a five.

                         and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look 
                         at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. 
                         Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, 
                         the red mark I made myself to throw 
                         you off Professor Chaos's trail.

                         for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... 
                         flood... the world!

                         sacred building will soon be under leagues 
                         and leagues of cold and dark water. 
                         And there is nothing you can do to stop 
                         me! General Disarray, begin the flooding 
                         of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! 
                         You made the outcasts of the world!

                         Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now 
                         but watch the world die!  Boy, this 
                         sure is takin' a long time.

                         as our new friend?

                         Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned 
                         all the time. You can't really rely 
                         on him for anything.

                         take this decision lightly. Whoever 
                         we pick is going to be the person we

                          He's quiet and he takes direction well.

                         a boat? You know, like a little raft 
                         or something, so that when the world

                         live?

                         a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.
