                          And in other news, another school shooting 
                         has taken place, this time in Idaho. 
                         As these kinds of shooting increase, 
                         one thing becomes clear: Your children 
                         are not safe at school.

                          This was the second time a terrorist 
                         threat has been made on a theme park, 
                         leaving everyone to realize that children 
                         are not safe outside.

                          And it seems there's a new danger to 
                         look out for: children who are taken 
                         by strangers. The bottom line: children 
                         are not safe... in their own homes!

                         town.  The report further states that 
                         it is because the child trusts the individual

                         Oh, it's just... I was wondering if 
                         Stan's okay.
 
                                     RANDY
                          Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere 
                         safe by now.

                         Do you really think we did the right 
                         thing, Randy? Sending all the young 
                         kids in town to live on their own?

                         I know. 

                                     RANDY
                         Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan 
                         and all the other kids are somewhere 
                         safe, off in a whole new city by now, 
                         making a new life for themselves.

                         sensationalist news reports go to our

                         The Ghost of Human Kindness was right 
                         all along.

                         You mean how he said we should trust 
                         each other, or how he abducted children?

                         The uh... no no, the part about being 
                         more trusting. We should follow what 
                         he said, not what he did.
 
                                     ADULTS
                         Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.

                         No, no. You know who was right all along? 
                         The Mongolians.  They knew that you 
                         just can't wall yourself off from the 
                         outside world. Putting walls up never 
                         helps anything. Tearing them down brings 
                         us together.

                         Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.

                         now?
 
                                     RANDY
                         Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. 
                         Hoomme.

                         stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ.
