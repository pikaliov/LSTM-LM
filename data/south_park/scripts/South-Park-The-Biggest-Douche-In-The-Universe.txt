                         died in November, or Thanksgiving could 
                         have been really special for them. But

                         the oven, too.  Ain't gonna have no 
                         time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame 
                         me, a woman can't bake no roast and 
                         do everything else at the same time. 
                          Can't say that the roast is gonna be 
                         terrible, maybe just a little dry.  
                         But I suppose we can make some extra 
                         gravy to take the dryness out later.

                         Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name 
                         that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? 
                          They want me to acknowledge Pete, or 
                         Peter.

                         No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick 
                         a random name and wait for somebody 
                         in the audience to give a response. 
                         Now that I see that there's a lone woman

                         her husband. So I say, "Peter was your 
                         husband?"

                          I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! 
                         I started by saying, "They want me to 
                         acknowledge Peter." That could have 
                         meant Peter was in the audience or that 
                         Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter 
                         had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? 
                         Now, I can look at this woman and see 
                         that she's fairly young, so odds are 
                         her husband was fairly young when he 
                         died. So I can say something like, "I'm 
                         getting that Peter's death was very 
                         untimely"

                         Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know 
                         you're here to try to throw me off,

                         You see, I learned something today. 
                         At first I thought you were all stupid, 
                         listening to this douche's advice, but 
                         now I understand that you're all here 
                         because you're scared. You're scared 
                         of death and he offers you some kind 
                         of understanding. You all want to believe 
                         in it so much, I know you do. You find 
                         comfort in the thought that your loved 
                         ones are floating around trying to talk 
                         to you, but thnk about it: Is that really 
                         what you want? To just be floating around 
                         after you die, having to talk to this 
                         asshole?  We need to recognize this 
                         stuff for what it is: magic tricks. 
                         Because whatever's really going on in 
                         life and in death is much more amazing 
                         than this douche.
