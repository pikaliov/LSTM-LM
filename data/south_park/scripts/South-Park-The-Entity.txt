                         Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, 
                         but with the ability to travel at much 
                         faster speeds. The designs of our electrical

                         this won't work either!

                         It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A 
                         moped would be too dangerous at those 
                         speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet 
                         power of an aircraft could be scaled 
                         down into a personal vehicle?

                         minute. What did you say?

                          Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In 
                         my class you need to be able to concentrate.

                         Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison 
                         has apparently invented a new vehicle 
                         that will give the airlines a run for 
                         their money. Mr. Garrison is putting 
                         the final touches on his top secret 
                         device, which he simply calls "IT". 
                          So what exactly is "IT"?  Here with 
                         a report is a Hispanic man with some 
                         gravy stains on his lapel.

                         Thanks, Tom, I-oh...  Thanks, Tom. So 
                         far Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone 
                         get a look at his invention. He claims 
                         that the vehicle is sooo genius and 
                         revolutionary that it could cause one's 
                         eyes to bleed if not properly prepared 
                         to see it. But earlier today HBC News 
                         got footage of some of the country's 
                         top investors and richest people who 
                         have been invited for a first look, 
                         including: Steve Forbes , Steve Jobs 
                         , Ted Turner , Donald Trump , Bill Gates 
                         , and Yasmine Bleeth . Their curiosity 
                         is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What 
                         is "IT"? What does "IT"do? And when 
                         will IT be somewhere where I can buy 
                         one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando ,

                         in World War II, some Jewish people 
                         were sent to concentration camps.

                         But I understand now how you might've 
                         felt what I said in the classroom was 
                         a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.

                         all like, "Hey, did you know that in 
                         World War II they really HAD concentration 
                         camps?" And I was all like, "No way!"

                         it was directed at his cousin." But, 
                         but I was literally talkin' about a
