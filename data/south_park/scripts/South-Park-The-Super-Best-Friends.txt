                         magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that

                         hearts.

                         Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and 
                         I've been a Blainetologist for about 
                         three years. So, when David Blaine performed 
                         his miracles out on the street, what 
                         moved you the most?

                                     STEVEN
                         Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much 
                         more than a magician. He's a scholar, 
                         a visionary, a leader.

                         When are we gonna learn magic tricks?

                                     STEVEN
                         Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: 
                         I can show you how to make your true 
                         self appear. Let me ask you all something: 
                         Do you consider yourselves to be happy?
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         I don't think I'm very happy. I always 
                         fall asleep to the sounds of my own 
                         screams.
 
                                     STEVEN
                         ...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that 
                         you are unha-
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         And then I always get woken up in the 
                         morning by the sounds of my own screams. 
                         Do you think I'm unhappy?
 
                                     STEVEN
                         Wait, the.. the point is... that you 
                         can be happy. You see, your friends 
                         and parents have programmed you in a 
                         way that makes you feel isolated and 
                         alone. How many times have you felt 
                         like nobody knows the real... you?  
                         You're not really happy.

                         no idea how unhappy I was until today.

                         Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.

                         I read in the Bible that you did miracles, 
                         too. If you could go in front of these 
                         people and do your miracles, then, they'll 
                         all see that David Blaine isn't so special.

                         The miracle I'm most famous for is turning 
                         water into wine.

                         Very well. I shall perform the miracle. 
                         Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, 
                         clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. 
                          Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay 
                         now, turn back.  It is now wine!

                         Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little 
                         better on people 2000 years ago.

                         do that lame water-to-wine trick.

                         grows larger every day. Soon, the government

                         accident at the age of 12 made him learn

                         wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten

                         courage to leave, too.

                         don't we sleep on it? If we decide to 
                         leave the faction, we can... do it in

                         Using the wood that Krishna cut down 
                         as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry 
                         skills to make a giant mold.
 
                                     JESUS
                         That should do the trick. Now for some 
                         concrete.

                         David Blaine to tell you how to live. 
                         See, cults are dangerous because they 
                         promise you hope, happiness and, maybe 
                         even an afterlife. But in return, they 
                         demand you pay money. Any religion that 
                         requires you to pay money in order to 
                         move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. 
                         See, all religions have something valuable 
                         to teach, but, just like the Super Best 
                         Friends learned, it requires a little 
                         bit of them all.
