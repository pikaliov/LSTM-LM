               [A mountain pass. Ms. Crabtree is driving the kids somewhere 
               and is going up a hill. The kids are having a grand old time 
               running around and tossing paper airplanes. Cartman has an entire 
               two-tiered chocolate cake on his laps. And a fork]

                         SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING 
                         VIDEO!
 
                                     TRAINER
                          Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's 
                         video guidebook. What to do if you become 
                         stranded. By now you've calmed down 
                         the children and kept order by using 
                         the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' 
                         technique. Now, it's time to get help. 
                         The most important thing to remember 
                         is that the children will be safe as 
                         long as they stay on the bus. So do 
                         not, under any circumstances, let any 
                         children off the bus. The best way to 
                         achieve this is to tell them something 
                         like, 'A big scary monster will eat 
                         you if you step off the bus.'
 
                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU 
                         DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!
 
                         
                                     TRAINER
                         That's right. With the children properly 
                         subdued, you can leave the bus and go 
                         out looking for assistance. And remember 
                         your bur driver's code: 'Sit down. And 
                         shut up!'
 
                                     MS. CRABTREE

                         soon as I cane. Remember. Don't get 
                         off this bus, or a big scary monster 
                         WILL EAT YOU!
