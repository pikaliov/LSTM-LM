               [An elderly woman's home. Cartman rings her doorbell, and she 
               answers it. Cartman is dressed in an orange hazmat suit and is 
               carrying a tank of something on his back]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up 
                         the neighborhood from parasites. Do 
                         you mind if I take a quick look around 
                         your house? I'm afraid you may have 
                         hippies.
 
                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         Hippies?

                                     CARTMAN
                          Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over 
                         the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson 
                         next door had seven hippies in her basement; 
                         they usually live in colonies.  Hm, 
                         I don't like the sound of that. Could 
                         I take a look in your attic?
 
               [The attic. He opens the door and looks in. He gets out a flashlight, 
               turns it on, and looks around again. He stops after a few seconds.]
 
               
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. 
                          See that? Hippies. 
 
                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         Oh my.

                                     CARTMAN
                         These are what we call the uh giggling 
                         stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, 
                         usually found in the attics. Problem 
                         is, if you see one hippie, there's probably 
                         a whole lot more you're not seein'. 
                         Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
 
               [The backyard. The elderly lady opens the door and Cartman walks 
               out onto the back porch]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yep, that's what I thought. See that? 
                         You've got a drum circle in your backyard. 
                         
 
                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, 
                         but I didn't think they were hurting 
                         anything.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson 
                         county. He had a little drum circle 
                         in his backyard. It turned into a drum 
                         circle four miles in diameter. You get 
                         a few hippies playing drums and next 
                         thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
 
                         
                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         Oh dear.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Well, your attic could be so we can 
                         fumigate with polymerethane. The drum 
                         circle we're gonna have to gas.  Goddamnit!

                         so high.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling 
                         stoners and your drum-cricle hippies 
                         RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract

                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Kid, we're have a city council meeting.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Mayor, something very big is happening, 
                         and if you all don't give me a moment 
                         of your time, there may be no more South 
                         Park to council over!
 
                                     RANDY
                          What are you talking about?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm talking about the end of all life 
                         as we know it.  For the past several 
                         days I've been... noticing a steep rise 
                         in the number of hippies coming to town. 
                          At first I thought maybe it was just 
                         a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  
                         Three new drum circles have sprouted 
                         up here, here, and here. They're all 
                         growing in diameter, at a rate of two 
                         hippies per hour. What this means... 
                         is that the hippies are conglomerating. 
                         They'er thriving, if you will. I think 
                         that they're setting up for a... . hippie 
                         music festival.

                         A what?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ti's, it's simple science. Look: When 
                         hippies start to nest in a new area, 
                         it draws other hippies in. With the 
                         right weather conditions and topography, 
                         it can lead to a music festival. One 
                         that last for days, even weeks. Reggae 
                         on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, 
                         they will all pale in comparison to 
                         what we're looking at now. In my professional 
                         opinion... I think we're looking at 
                         a full-blown hippie jam festival the 
                         size of which we've never seen. 
 
                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Kid, what the hell are you talking about?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         I know hippies. I've hated them all 
                         my life. I've kept this town free of 
                         hippies on my own since I was five and 
                         a half. But I can't contain them on 
                         my own anymore. We have to do something, 
                         fast!

                         Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about 
                         potholes right now, m'kay.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         It's not potholes you need to worry 
                         about. It's potheads. I know what these 
                         people are capable of.
 
                                     MAYOR MCDANIELS
                         Johnson, get him out of here. 

                                     CARTMAN

                         to me! You can't sweep this problem 
                         under the rug!  The town is in serious 
                         danger!

                         Well, so my idea was this: Let's have 
                         like a weeklong music festival, draw 
                         everyone here, and then together, we 
                         can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the 
                         hell?! 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         I knew you were trying to have a hippie 
                         jam festival! All right, everyone pack 
                         up your crap, we're going to our basement!

                         time. These college know-it-all hippies 
                         were setting up for a music festival, 
                         just as I predicted.

                         their concert here. Their little "festival" 
                         should pump some money into our economy.

                         this?!

                         considered hippies back in the '60s.

                         Yeah, but when we did it we actually 
                         stood for something. I mean, remember 
                         Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something 
                         there.

               and bares her tits and Randy dances so hard he gets dizzy and

                         the seams. We don't know where this 
                         music festival came from, but, it's

                         the school parking lot where Kyle has 
                         to watch me and get super-jealous because

                         Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies 
                         anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.

                         plans for you now.
