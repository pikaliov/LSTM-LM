               [Butters' house, day. Butters is in the living room eating some 
               soup. The doorbell rings. Butters stops and looks at the door. 
               He rises and opens it, and sees a large wooden crate waiting 
               on the porch]
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package! 
                          "To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's 
                         for me! It's for me!!  Who is it from? 
                         "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow! 
                         A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, 
                         what can it be? My birthday isn't until 
                         September 11th.  Oh boy! I've never 
                         gotten a package this big! I've always 
                         wanted to have a huge package. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                          Whoa...

                                     CARTMAN
                         I have been sent from Japan to serve 
                         as your personal robot.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          You... you're my robot?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes. I will be your new best friend.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh wow!

               [Moments later, Butters has Cartman sitting on his bed. Butters 
               goes to his desk and makes a few calls.]
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Yep. That's right. He's a real live 
                         robot. He can walk and talk and everything. 
                         You're like the fourth kid I told already. 
                          Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and 
                         I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're 
                         all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came 
                         into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best 
                         friend a guy could have.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In face, 
                         you should tell AWESOM-O all your most 
                         personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not 
                         make fun of you or tell your secrets 
                         to other people and stuff.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Hey yeah! Well I can tell you anything, 
                         huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, 
                         I have what's called a heziated colon, 
                         which means I sometime can't control 
                         my sphincter.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Could be.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes 
                         I poop my pants, so I have to wear a 
                         diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well, I have to take medicine for it 
                         every day. It's a little suppository 
                         I have to ...put up my rectom.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          That, that's very interesting. Tell 
                         AWESOM-O more secrets.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents 
                         don't know, but sometimes I get picked 
                         on by this one kid at school; his name 
                         is Eric Cartman, and he always tries 
                         to play jokes on me and stuff.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, really?

                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor 
                         had hit the earth, and convinced me 
                         to stay down in a bomb shelter for three 
                         days.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Heh. Wow, that sucks.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended 
                         to be me on the phone to my dad and 
                         called him a pussy, so my dad came home 
                         and beat me.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is 
                         pretty smart.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. 
                         And he's never gonna play on me ever 
                         again! 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Really? You think so? Well, guess what, 
                         Butters. I have a surprise for you.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 
                         'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is 
                         that I know one of his secrets!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         What?

                                     BUTTERS
                         When Cartman is playing all alone in 
                         his backyard, he likes to dress up like 
                         Britney Spears and pretend he's her! 
                         Hi sings and dances around with a life-sized 
                         cutout of Justin Timberlake.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         You saw that?

                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Nuh uh.

                                     BUTTERS
                         I've got the whole thing on tape! Even 
                         him making out with the Justin Timberlake 
                         cutout!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         No way.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with 
                         me again, I'm gonna show that video 
                         to everybody! Then I'll lhave my revenge, 
                         boy howdy!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. 
                         Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O 
                         the videotape?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         How come?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, 
                         back it up for you, and make copies 
                         and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come 
                         on! I have a lot of things to teach 
                         you. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Oh, son of a bitch!

               [Montage. Butters tosses a basketball with Cartman on the front 
               lawn. Cartman, as AWESOM-O, can't catch it]
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Hey there have you heard about my robot 
                         friend?
 
               [they're walking along in a meadow. Butters is telling him a 
               story]
 
               He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.

               He's a cyberwired bundle of joy. 

               [Butters has AWESOM-O take shots at a basketball hoop. The shot 
               is good and Butters is pleased]
 
               My robot friend. 

               [Stan, Kyle and Kenny observe nearby from behind a bush. They're 
               dismayed at what they see. Stan grabs his nose and squeezes his 
               eyes shut, then walks off. Kyle and Kenny follow]
 
               I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend. 

               [jumps in a puddle, then has AWESOM-O do the same. Butters giggles]
 
               
               He's smart as can be and emotion-free 

               [washes dishes while AWESOM-O dries them, then they go see "The 
               Prince and Me." They exit, with Butters skipping beside AWESOM-O. 
               Butters loved the movie]
 
               And he's computin' his way to my heart.

               My robot friend. 

               [At a restaurant two burgers reach Butters' table. He gets one, 
               he motions to the waiter that AWESOM-O gets the other one. The 
               waiter looks confused, then walks away with the other burger]
 
               
               My robot friend. 

               [Butters has AWESOM-O pull him along in a red wagon]

               My robot friend. 

               [they walk into a sunset together]

               My robot ...friend.

                         Ohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters 
                         and his friend Eric playing Robot.

                          Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. 
                         Leave it to them to find a fun way to 
                         do the dishes. 
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry 
                         all my laundry in one trip!
 
                                     LINDA
                         Ah, Buttters, it's getting late. You 
                         should be getting ready for bed soon.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.

                         the night?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well of course he is. He's my robot, 
                         ain't he?
 
                                     LINDA
                         That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         AWESOM-O does not have a mom.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Yup! Don't you know nothin' about robot? 
                         Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry 
                         away! 
 
                                     LINDA
                         Aww, that's just adorable.

                         It's good to see Butters finally have 
                         a friend that wants to stay over.

                         I like to brush my teeth in the morning 
                         and at night. The teeth won't mind ..

                         this.  Butters, remember when you said 
                         you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed 
                         like Britney Spears?
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh. Yeah.

                         I would like to see what he looks like 
                         so I can beat him up for you. May I 
                         see the video?

                         Hey, I gotta put in my suppository. 
                          Can you help me?

                         Remember I said I put that medicinal 
                         suppository in my anus? It'll be so 
                         much easier havin' you do it from now 
                         on.

                         Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed 
                         for that function.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. 
                         You just take this little thingy out 
                         of the plastic... paper, and and I'll, 
                         I'll pull down my pants ...and just 
                         slide it up in my anus there.

                         to do whatever I tell you.

                         Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that 
                         we live in a time of uncertainty. The 
                         risk of an attack on American soil is 
                         higher than ever. Now, I believe we 
                         may be able to curb that risk. Two days 
                         ago our intelligence department came 
                         across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It 
                         is currently being used by Catamount 
                         Pictures to develop ideas for movies. 
                         Our sources say that in just one week 
                         it has come up with over one thousand 
                         movie ideas, eight hundred of which 
                         feature Adam Sandler.

                         You're thinking the robot could be used

                         No. If we got our hands on that robot, 
                         we could reprogram it and turn it into 
                         a weapon!.

                         do.

                         Hold on a second: If that robot is designed 
                         for entertainment, then, turning it 
                         into a weapon is unethical.

                         Unethical? Let me explain something 
                         to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand 
                         that the robot is from Japan! That means 
                         that the Japanese have more of them! 
                         And if the Japanese fabricates one of 
                         them into a weapon before we do...

                         this isn't humanity? Who's to judge 
                         what makes somethng human anyway?!  
                         Does this make me human?!  Or this?!

                          Perhaps... there is consciousness in 
                         this robot. Maybe we as a society need 
                         to realize that artificial intelligence... 
                         is intelligence all the same, and we 
                         can learn from the robots. I think maybe 
                         one day we can all-  Heh- wait a minute, 
                         did, did that robot just fart?

                         Oh, and it, it smells, too!

                         A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't 
                         make any sense.

                         Hang on a second here! 

               [A room somewhere. A portable screen is put up and the videotape 
               of Cartman acting strange in his backyard is being shown. The 
               sound of laughing kids is heard. On the tape, Cartman is dancing 
               around like Britney Spears]
