                         Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this 
                         is why we have hate-crime laws! This 
                         "monster" commited a crimenot against 
                         an individual, but against a race! Do 
                         the democratic thing and send his fat 
                         little butt to prison!

                         Bronco is heading east on 285. Police 
                         officers are right behind him  but as 
                         with any chase, they're keeping a safe 
                         distance to avoid any accidents here 
                         out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like 
                         the fugitive is going to make a bold 
                         move off an exit off 285. He's going 
                         into a residential neighborhood now; 
                         this is where it could get dangerous,

                          If somebody kills somebody, it's a

                         of a different color, it's a hate crime.

                         crimes. If a man beats another man because

                          Mayor, it is time to stop splitting 
                         people into groups. All hate crimes 
                         do is support the idea that blacks are 
                         different from whites, that homosexuals 
                         need to be treated differently from 
                         non-homos, that we aren't the same.
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                          But instead, we should all be treated 
                         the same, with the same laws and the 
                         same punishments for the same crimes 
                         . For in that way Cartman can be freed 
                         from prison, and we  will have a chance 
                         to win the sledding race on Thursday.

                         You know how you told me you always 
                         wanted to see Disneyland?
 
                                     ROMPER STOMPER
                         Yeah. 

                                     CARTMAN
                          Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. 
                         Ugh.
 
                                     ROMPER STOMPER
                         Whoa!
