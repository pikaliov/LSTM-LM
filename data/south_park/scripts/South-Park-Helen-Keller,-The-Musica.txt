               [A stage, rehearsal, day. Stan, Kyle, and Wendy are in costume 
               on stage. Stan is dressed in a white suit and bowtie, and a fake 
               beard and moustache. Kyle is dressed as a country doctor with 
               starched collar, and Wendy is dressed in white pants, purple 
               coat and beret, and bowtie. The stage itself has a door prop 
               and a tripod table with a bowl and jar atop it. Kyle enters through 
               the door.]

                         Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be 
                         okay?

                         I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but 
                         I'm afraid your daughter Helen still 
                         cannot see, hear, or speak.
 
                                     WENDY
                         Oh no! NO!

                         My poor little Helen.

                         She can't see or hear us, John.

                         Heh-aaaah, Timmih!

                                     STAN
                          E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an 
                         asyluh.

                         I can't understand your lines!

                         Can we take a lunch break now?

                                     CARTMAN
                         No! If we want our play to be better 
                         than the kindergartners' play, we have 
                         to rehearse as much as possible! Now 
                         let's continue the scene!

                         I believe I can teach this child to 
                         communicate.

                         The kidnergartners! I just came from 
                         their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, 
                         you guys. It's real good!

                         They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian 
                         ones, too! They've got singing and dancing 
                         and boy you've never seen such a show! 
                         Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
 
                         
               Clyde	Oh, no!

                         We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!

                         Oh yeah, we can't!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, 
                         we still got four days until the Thanksgiving 
                         festival; that's plenty of time to revamp 
                         our play!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth 
                         grade class has to perform the Helen 
                         Keller Story.
 
                                     CARRTMAN
                         Yeah, but nobody told us how we had 
                         to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff 
                         and music numbers, too.
 
                                     CLYDE
                         Well, we can add music numbers, but 
                         how do we make the Helen Keller story 
                         more Thanksgivingy?
 
                                     WENDY
                         I know! How about, instead of a dog, 
                         Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
 
                                     TOKEN
                         Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.

                         and Wendy, you go out and find some 
                         musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, 
                         take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving 
                         decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, 
                         you go out and find a turkey!

                         needs is a big opening number. Something 
                         that sets up the entire show.

                         a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these

                         I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw 
                         the turkey and wanted to get it. What 
                         do you want me to say to him?

                         we wanted, but maybe we can train it.

                         point was to make our play better than 
                         the kindergartners.

                          Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving 
                         turkey is what you require? I know of 
                         a turkey.

                          During my years on Broadway I... worked 
                         with a turkey who could do all kinds 
                         of tricks. She even jumped through a 
                         hoop of fire.

                         is like. Deprive yourself of your senses 
                         and see what plays inside your mind.

               also. What they see is a sign that reads, "Thanksgiving Turkey.

               [the turkeys leave the room and enter another one. A movie screen 
               faces them. Another worker appears and closes the door behind 
               the turkeys. The turkeys remain excited until a movie comes up 
               with sweeping views of nature. The turkeys calm down, and a view 
               of clouds zipping along the sky follows. Then waterfalls. The 
               lights come up and a giant saw comes out and chops the heads 
               off all the turkeys save one. The saw rises. Only Gobbles survives, 
               and he keeps his head low as he finds a clearing. A large board 
               appears and pushes the decapitated turkeys out an opening on 
               the opposite wall. The bodies are then lifted up and returned 
               to the truck they came in, but the building they come out of 
               is 3C. Gobbles falls off the truck and ends up on the floor.
