               'Cause he's just clinging to your sphincter

               And he won't drop out and so you ...shake you ass around

                         a little bit different tonight. Instead 
                         of our normal thing, we're just gonna 
                         sit back and enjoy some holiday songs.

                         let's start off with a festive Channukah 
                         song, sung by my favorite Jewish person 
                         in the whole world.

                         Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, 
                         so I have to show you how to celebrate 
                         a Channukah.  This is called a dreidel. 
                         You spin it and see where it lands. 
                         And you sing this song:
 
               I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.

               And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Hoh,
 
               
               Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.

               Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

               Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.

               But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.

                         Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't 
                         it? But let's not forget that for some 
                         people Christmas is about the birth 
                         of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious 
                         Christmas song sung by Eric Cartman.
 
                         
               [The town of Bethlehen. Cartman is superimpsoed on it. He's in

                         And

               O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shining

               [The Star of the Nativity appears, then the Three Wise Men]
 
               
               It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-bir-birth 

               [The Nativity and Cartman are seen in the background, Formal 
               Cartman vanishes]
 
               O Holy Night, the- something something distant. 

               [Formal Cartman before a starry sky]

               It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie. 

               [Present-day Cartman finishes decorating the tree, helps himself 
               to a pie]
 
               Jesus was born, and so I get presents. 

               [Little Drummer Cartman stands before the manger scene, 

               Present-day Cartman is seen tearing into his gifts back at home.]
 
               
               Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o) 

               [back at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman turns to look at 
               Baby Jesus.]

               On your knees (On your knees) [Cartman falls on his knees]

               And hear (Can't you hear)

               When I get presents (O-o) 

               [at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman takes the gifts meant 
               for Jesus]
 
               O night (O o-night) [loads them up on his camel, with other presents]

                         And now, let's hear from the school 
                         teacher, Mr. Garrison.
 
               [South Park Elementary. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison has 
               drawn a world map on the board.]

                         Okay, children, let's take our seats. 
                         Today we're going to learn how different 
                         cultures around the world celebrate 
                         the holiday season.

                         Now, pay attention. Ahem...

               I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East

               [points it out]

               No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious 
               beliefs
 
               They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday. 

               [shows some Arabic writing]

               And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, 

               [tosses the picture away]

               
               [In the Middle East]

               Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!

               Put down that book the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes 
 
               
               [rips the Koran out of the Muslim's hand and dresses him up as 
               a tree]
 
               In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus's birthday 

               [removes the veils of two women, who turn out ugly]

               So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. 

               [sticks a candy cane in the man's house]

               
               There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. 

               [pulls down a chart showing India's demerits.]

               They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. 
               
 
               [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]

               They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph 
               is about.

               And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,

               
               [In India, next to a swami sitting on a bed of nails]

               Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!

               Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. 
 
               
               [gives beef to one man, pours eggnog on another]

               In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus's birthday. 

               [wraps a few people in Christmas lights]

               So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. 

               [passes out wreaths]

               
               Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.

               They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin. 

               [on the chalkboard, a drawing of a Japanese man with needles 
               stuck into him]
 
               On Decemer 25th all they do is eat a cake.

               And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

               
               Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!

               God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.

               In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. 
 
               
               [throws some straw on the musicians]

               So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to 
               you.

               others in lights]
 
               
               [dressed as Santa, dances around the class]

               On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say,

               "Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!

               Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you."
