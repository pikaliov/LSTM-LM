                         Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby 
                         Jones meant when he said, "This is not 
                         a victimless crime"? Anybody?  Children, 
                         were you paying attention?!

                         Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby 
                         Jones repeats for eight days now. It's 
                         hard to keep paying attention.

                         you just forget what Barnaby Jones has 
                         to say?! Why don't you not pay attention 
                         to Barnaby Jones and then let's see 
                         how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, 
                         why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones 
                         knew the poison was in the milk?

                         Well, it is. But I have a bone disease 
                         which impedes my ability to pronounce 
                         the "t" in "plane'arium"

                         transplant.  Yes, little boy?

                         the king of rock and roll. You're a 
                         fat, stupid, worthless policeman in 
                         a small town. Mkay?

                         Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied
