                          This is shop class.  My name is Mr. 
                         Adler. For the next week, rather than 
                         your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning 
                         how to make things. Now, does anybody 
                         know WHY you're in shop class?  Yes?

                         Because we had to choose between this 
                         and home ec, and we didn't wanna be 
                         sissies?

                         Wrong! You are here because you are 
                         America's future!  You may someday be 
                         doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. 
                         Most of you, however, will be pumping 
                         gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's 
                         why we have...  shop class.

                         Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: 
                         I don't like kids that screw around! 
                         You screw around in shop class, you

                          Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should 
                         have taken home ec.

                         jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty

                         here, the fight will be happening out 
                         by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek 
                         just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig

                          On your first date, look at the man's 
                         shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much 
                         money a man has just by his shoes.  
                         When he takes you out to dinner, try 
                         to sneak a peek at his wallet while 
                         he pays for you. If he only has one 
                         credit card, BEWARE.  It means he doesn't 
                         spend a lot, and worse yet, it could 
                         be a debit card. If he has more than 
                         four credit cards, that's a little fishy. 
                          The perfect number of credit cards 
                         for a man to have is... two.
