                         it's unbelievable.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't 
                         mean we can't still hang out.  It just 
                         means that I matured faster than you. 
                          You'll get your pubes guys, someday.

                                     STAN
                         When you get old enough, you grow your 
                         own pubic hair that's attached to you, 
                         you fuckin' dumbass!

                          But then why would Scott Tenorman sell 
                         me his pubes for ten dollars?
 
                                     KYLE
                         Because, retard, you're dumb enough 
                         to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten 
                         dollars!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         You're telling me these pubes are worth 
                         nothing.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah.

                         sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."

                         when I bought these pubes from you, 
                         that you were full of shit! So you can

                         Wuh what are you gonna do?

                         Did you guys see that movie Hannibal? 
                         Where the deformed guy trained giants 
                         pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, 
                         if we find a pony , we can train it. 
                         Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's 
                         weiner.  It will be painful and humiliating! 
                         Everyone will see it happen! And then, 
                         Scott Tenorman will forever be known 
                         as the kid who had his weiner bitten 
                         off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
 
                                     KYLE
                         What's in it for us?

                                     CARTMAN
                         What?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, why should we all care about getting 
                         Scott Tenorman back for you?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, 
                         why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's 
                         just let Scott Tenorman walk away with 
                         my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. 
                         Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans 
                         of the world take what's ours and laugh 
                         in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves 
                         when you can just walk out of here right 
                         now and say, "It's not your problem." 
                         But... years from now, when you're old 
                         and have children of your own, what 
                         would you give to come back and fight 
                         this one day? This one day, when you 
                         could have made a difference! Where 
                         you could have told Scott Tenorman, 
                         "You may take our pride, but you'll 
                         naver take my Goddamned sixteen dollars 
                         and twelve cents!!"  Now who's with 
                         me?!! 
 
                                     TIMMY
                         Timmay!

                                     CARTMAN
                          Christ. Alright, I guess it's just 
                         you and me, Timmy!
 
                                     TIMMY

                         No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite 
                         someone's penis off.

                         usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers

                         the members from Radiohead, probably

                         I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. 
                         He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman 
                         too.  I think all the guys in the band

                          li'l scheme  that should put Scott 
                         in his place for good! And if you help 
                         me, I'll give each of you... two... 
                         dollars.

                         It's the brilliant combination of my 
                         last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite 
                         band is Radiohead, right?

                         to come here to South Park?" right? 
                         Then they could meet Scott Tenorman 
                          and  see him get his weiner bitten 
                         off by a pony!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Don't you see? If I can get this pony 
                         to bite off Scott's weiner in front 
                         of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. 
                         And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will 
                         say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! 
                         And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna 
                         die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the 
                         pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play 
                         here! Ready? Break!!

               Dear Radiohead,

               
               My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy 
               from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid 
               I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid 
               he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and 
               it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts 
               to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please 
               consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday 
               around 5.

                         he likes it when I tell him he just 
                         ate the pubes of every kid in town!

                         Yeah! 

               [South Park, next day. The Chili Con Carnival is in full swing. 
               People have already arrived. Stan and Kyle walk up]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming 
                         to my Chili Con Carnival!
 
                                     STAN
                         This is the dumbest thing you've ever 
                         done, Cartman.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott 
                         Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay 
                         to see the fireworks!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss 
                         this. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         What's so funny?

                                     STAN
                         Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're 
                         gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead 
                         here yet?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Not yet, but they will be.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, sure. 

                                     CHEF
                         Hello, Eric!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey, Chef.

                                     CHEF
                         I made some chili to enter into the 
                         contest.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         What contest?

                                     CHEF
                         This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, 
                         Chef, just put it over here.
 
                                     CHEF
                         It's my special recipe.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? 
                         Thanks so much for coming! 
 
                                     SCOTT
                         Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          Likewise. Well, come on, you've got 
                         to see the pony!
 
                                     SCOTT
                         Just a second: don't you- wanna taste 
                         my chili first?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special 
                         guest coming, and I want you to be near 
                         the pony when they arrive.
 
                                     SCOTT
                         Well I don't want it to get cold. I 
                         think I can win first prize.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to 
                         the judging table and we'll try the 
                         chili first.  Goddamnit!
 
               [Cartman's house, the judging table. Cartman and Scott take their 
               seats. Behind Scott stand Butters, Kyle, Stan, and Scott's friends. 
               Behind Cartman stand Bebe, Clyde, and Token]
 
                                     SCOTT
                          Alright, I guess we should taste each 
                         other's chili, huh?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Huh, this chili looks pretty good. 
                         Weh, here's mine. 
 
                                     SCOTT
                         Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is 
                         pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine 
                         is better. Try it.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Alright.  Hey, this is great! 

                                     SCOTT
                         Eh, it's a special recipe

                                     CARTMAN
                          Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
 
                         
                                     SCOTT
                         I'm glad you like it so much, because 
                         now that you're almost finished, I have 
                         some'in' to tell you.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         What? You mean about how you put pubes 
                         in your chili? 
 
                                     SCOTT
                         What?!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, 
                         Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's 
                         delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on 
                         that. What I did plan on, however, was 
                         that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would 
                         betray me and warn you that the Chili 
                         Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed 
                         that they would tell you that I had 
                         trained Denkins' pony to bite off your 
                         weiner. What they didn't tell you was 
                         that Denkins is a crazy redneck who 
                         shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing 
                         that you would try and do somethng to 
                         the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that 
                         violent pony killers were in the area. 
                          I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, 
                         for fear of having your weiner bitten 
                         off. You would most likely send your 
                         parents.  And, I'm afraid that when 
                         Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, 
                         he shot and killed both your parents. 
                         
 
                                     MR. DENKINS
                          Well, they was trespassin' and I was 
                         protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.
 
                         
                                     SCOTT
                         My... mom and dad are... dead? 

                                     CARTMAN
                         I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins 
                         giving his report to Officer Barbrady. 
                         And of course, to steal the bodies... 
                          After a night with the hacksaw, I was 
                         all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, 
                         so that I could tell you personally 
                         about your parents' demise! And of course, 
                         feed you your chili.  Do you like it? 
                         Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, "Mr. 
                         & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."

                         doesn't mean you have to be a little 
                         crybaby about it.
