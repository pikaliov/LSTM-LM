                         Coming this summer , it's the classic 
                         film that changed America. E.T.: The 
                         Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version 
                         for 2002.  All the E.T. effects have 
                         been digitally upgraded.  All the guns 
                         have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. 
                         And the word "TERRORIST" has been changed 
                         to "HIPPIE."

                         Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the 
                         same thing.

                         No, dude. They only changed "terrorist" 
                         to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.

                         and updated, until we can't even recognize

                         Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those 
                         asshole directors to keep changing their 
                         movies and making them different! Movies 
                         are art, and art shouldn't be modified!

                         Roman Coliseum every year? It would 
                         just be another big douchey stadium 
                         now.

                         We have to do something. Let's form

                         Yeah! We can form a club that takes 
                         food stamps from poor people and then 
                         sells them back to the government for 
                         a profit.

                         No, fatass! I mean a club to protect 
                         films from their directors, so they 
                         can't be messed with!

                         supposed to take it easy; just, watch 
                         the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if 
                         we form a club there'll be responsibilites.

                         just learned that George Lucas and Steven

                         in George Lucas's house. We need to 
                         find and usurp that negative.

               alternating blinking lights. The camera moves off the sign and

               Ark of the Covenant, which was in the box. The men move off. 
               The audience is seen, with the four boys in the very back. Stan

               is reaching for a golden item. Rays of light alight from the 
               screen and move out over the audience, shooting through the viewers' 
               chests and killing them. Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg are overwhelmed 
               with the energy from the rays. The men become disfigured, then 
               their faces melt away. Spielberg's head explodes. The rays diffuse, 
               then gather back into the Ark. The spirits of all killed are 
               gathered into the Ark as well. The lid lands on the Ark perfectly 
               with a final roll of thunder. A few second laters, when all is 
               quiet, Stan raises his head and looks around]

               Raiders of the Lost Ark into a large box. He nails the box shut

               down a long corridor. On each side are other boxes and crates 
               of stuff put there so as not to cause any more harm to anyone.
