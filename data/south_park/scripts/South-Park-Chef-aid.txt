                         rock business. And now it looks like 
                         some big record company has published 
                         one of my songs.

                         "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote 
                         several years ago.

                          Hmmm. I really see no resemblance between 
                         that song and "Stinky Britches" by our 
                         artist, Alanis Morissette.

                          God-damned, I hate that Cochran guy. 
                         If he was here in front of me, I'd be 
                         like, "Ay! You stupid son of a bitch, 
                         you d-. I b-. I'ma I'm gonna kick you 
                         in the nuts!"

                          And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen 
                         of the jury, you've heard the version 
                         of my client's song recorded over twenty 
                         years ago. You've heard the EXACT SAME 
                         song produced by these cheats in the 
                         past month . I'd say it's pretty much 
                         an open-and-shut case. Make the right 
                         decision. Thank you.  I've got 'em.

                          Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed 
                         jury, Chef's attorney would certainly 
                         want you to believe that his client 
                         wrote "Stinky Britches" ten years ago. 
                         And they make a good case. Hell, I almost 
                         felt pity myself. But ladies and gentlemen 
                         of this supposed jury, I have one, final, 
                         thing I want you to consider.  Ladies 
                         and gentleman, this is Chew-bacca.  
                         Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet 
                         Kashyyyk, but Chewbacca LIVES on the 
                         planet Endor. Now think about that. 
                         That does NOT MAKE SENSE.
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                          Damn it!

                                     CHEF
                          What?

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                          He's using the Chewbacca defense!
 
                         
                                     COCHRAN
                         Why would a Wookie, an eight-foot tall 
                         Wookie, want to live on Endor, with 
                         a bunch of two-foot tall Ewoks? That 
                         does NOT MAKE SENSE!  But more important, 
                         you have to ask yourself: What does 
                         this have to do with this case? Nothing. 
                          Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing 
                         to do with this case! It does NOT MAKE 
                         SENSE! Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending 
                         a major record company, and I'm talkin' 
                         about Chewbacca! Does that make sense? 
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making 
                         any sense! None of this makes sense! 
                         And so you have to remember, when you're 
                         in that jury room deliberatin' and conjugatin' 
                         the Emancipation Proclamation,  does 
                         it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen 
                         of this supposed jury, it does NOT MAKE 
                         SENSE! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, 
                         you must acquit! The defense rests.

                         past.  I remember when I was just starting 
                         out. Chef suggested I buy a pompadour 
                         hat. I thought he said, "bite the head 
                         off a bat," so I did. And the rest, 
                         oh, it's just history. Now, let's go 
                         freakeeee!

                          Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though 
                         Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm 
                         still gonna stick with you.

                         But I feel like I'd be making the wrong 
                         decision.

                         Love isn't a decision, it's a feeling. 
                         If we could decide who we love, it would 
                         be much simpler, but much less magical.

                         You will?

                                     COCHRAN
                         I will.

                                     CROWD
                         YEA!!

                                     MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
                         No!

                                     COCHRAN
                         We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer.
 
                         
                                     MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
                          Nooooooooooo!

               [Back to the courthouse. Cochran now prosecutes for Chef, and 
               the record producer has a new lawyer. The boys are now among 
               the obssrvers]
 
                                     COCHRAN
                         Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed 
                         jury, you must now decide whether or 
                         not to reverse the decision for my client, 
                         Chef.  I know he seeems guilty, but 
                         ladies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca. 
                          Now think about that for one minute: 
                         that does NOT MAKE SENSE! Why am I talkin' 
                         about Chewbacca when a man's life is 
                         on the line?  Why? I tell you why. I 
                         don't know. It doesn't make sense. If 
                         Chewbacca does not make sense, you must 
                         acquit!  Here, look at the monkey. Look 
                         at the silly monkey. 
 
               [The courthouse doors open and Chef emerges, with the four boys 
               behind him. Reporters gather around him]
 
                                     REPORTER
                         Chef? How does it feel to be a free 
                         man and finally have your name credited 
                         on the song, "Stinky Britches"?
 
                                     CHEF
                         It feels greaheet! I just can't fuhind 
                         the words to thank all the artists who 
                         put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I 
                         want to thank the children.
 
                                     REPORTER
                         So, what are you gonna do now?

                                     CHEF
                         Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday! 
                         And that means tomorrow is Tuna Casserole 
                         Day.
 
                                     THE BOYS
                         Hooray!
