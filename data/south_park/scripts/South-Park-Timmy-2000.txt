                         Yeah. But there was so much of it. I

                         homework last night, because we're goin' 
                         to talk about pages 42 through 612. 
                         First of all, who can tell me what year 
                         the Founding Fathers got together?

                         to do with you. You're getting very 
                         poor marks in school and the teachers 
                         are complaining that you aren't paying 
                         attention.

                         held back a grade, I suggest you start 
                         cooperating, m'kay?!

                         Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, 
                         Timmy, until you can learn to respect 
                         your elders!

                         Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal 
                         Victoria.  I think I may know what the 
                         problem is.

                         Yes, of course.

                         What??

                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                          I think maybe Timmy is suffering from 
                         something called, "Attention Deficit 
                         Disorder," or ADD. It's very common 
                         in kids his age.

                         Well, that certainly would explain it.

                         It should be easy enough to find out. 
                         They have tests for that kind of thing 
                         now, m'kay?

                         Alright, this is a very sinple test 
                         which should determine without a doubt 
                         whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit 
                         Disorder.

                         a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by 
                         F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the 
                         novel I'll ask you a few questions.

                          Okay, here we go.  "In my younger and 
                         more vulnerable years, my father gave 
                         me some advice that I've been turning 
                         over in my mind ever since"  "so we 
                         beat on, boats against the current,

                         that has taken the country by storm. 
                          Already playing at several large venues 
                         this month , the band prepares for its 
                         biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they 
                         will open for Phil Collins. But Phil 
                         Collins is not happy.

                          Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, 
                         idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna 
                         see Timmy for his musical skills. They're 
                         laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't 
                         laugh at people with disabilities!

                         was saying about Timmy?

                         Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. 
                         And all those bastards did was hold 
                         me back and hold me back. But then, 
                         finally, I went solo. And that's when 
                         I started writing really great songs. 
                         But look, if you happen to be on the 
                         sidelines, you know, bein' more of a 
                         cheerleader than a player, well, then 
                         I guess you should stay on as Timmy's 
                         shadow.

                         I know what it is! But now you've got 
                         a town full of zombie children from 
                         the planet Zandor.

                         doctors are giving children Ritalin! 
                         And for every one child that actually 
                         needs it, you give it to 50,000 that 
                         don't!
 
                                     CLINIC DOCTOR

                                     CHEF
                         That's right! You've made them so dull 
                         and boring that they'er actually going 
                         to go to a Phil Collins concert!

                         Well, if I had known... Phl Collins, uh, 
                         my God! 
 
                                     CHEF
                         Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!
 
                         
                                     CLINIC DOCTOR
                         We uh... have to convince them not to 
                         take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard 
                         to get it away from them.
 
                                     CHEF
                         Then we need an antidote!

                                     PHARMACIST
                         Yes, of course.

                                     CLINIC DOCTOR
                         Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?
 
                         
                                     PHARMACIST
                         I have some right here.  It's a compound 
                         called "Ritalout."
 
                                     CHEF
                         Alright. Come on, we've got to get the 
                         antidote to all the children. Quick!

                         Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 

                                     PHIL COLLINS
                         I know. I'd like to sing the complex 
                         and amazing song that won me the Oscar, 
                         a song entitlted, "You'll Be In... Me." 
                          Thanks.
 
               You're inside of me.

               Deep inside of me. [Chef hands drinks to more kids]

               So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.

                                     CHEF
                         Come on, drink it down. It's free.

                         Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off

                         I feel... different.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! 
                         Please! Hegh, hegh

                          Well, thanks! 

                                     STAN
                         Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! 
                         Boooooo!
 
                                     CHEF
                          I think it's working.

                                     AUDIENCE
                         Booooo!!

                                     PHIL COLLINS
                          Shut your filthy holes, you little 
                         bastards!
 
                                     STAN
                         Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We 
                         want Timmy!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah!

                                     PHIL COLLINS
                         You just wanna laugh at him.

                                     STAN
                         No!  You see, we learned something today. 
                         Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but 
                         what's wrong with laughter? Just because 
                         we laugh at something doesn't mean we 
                         don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, 
                         and playing made Timmy smile, so where 
                         was the harm in that? The people that 
                         are wrong are the ones that think people 
                         like Timmy should be "protected" and 
                         kept out of the public's eye. The cool 
                         thing about Timmy being in a band was 
                         that he was in your face, and you had 
                         to deal with him, whether you laughed 
                         or cried, or felt nothing. That's why 
                         Timmy rules!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!

                         Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!

                         They booed Phil Collins off the stage. 
                         Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the 
                         Lords of the Underworld.

                          Oh, so now that they want us, you think 
                         you can waltz, um, back into our lives 
                         and be in the band again? 
 
                                     SKYLER
                         I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... 
                         Well, I just wanted to say we had some 
                         pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe 
                         I let fame and Phil Collins go to my 
                         head...
