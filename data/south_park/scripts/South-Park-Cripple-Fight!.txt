               [South park, night. Randy is driving the boys, including Timmy 
               on the truck bed, through the town. Stuart is with them, but 
               Kyle is not. The boys are in Scout gear.]

                         Well, you boys must be pretty excited: 
                         your first night of Scouts.

                         It's gonna suck. There's gonna be all 
                         like, new kids there we don't know.

                         Well, now, that's part of the fun!
 
                         
                                     RANDY
                         Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in 
                         Scouts for years.
 
                                     STAN
                         Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh 
                         yeah, you don't have a dad. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         That's not funny! Jesus Christ!

                          Are you excited for your first night 
                         of Scouts, Timmy??

                         Huhboiy, am I glad to see you guys! 
                         There's lots of kids here from other 
                         schools, and I don't know anybody.

                         Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the 
                         bar. We'll be back to pick you up at 
                         nine.

                         You boys just make sure to obey the 
                         scout leader now. He's the man in charge.

                         Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you 
                         and your little friends' names on the

                          I just got transferred in.  I think 
                         everyone's here now, so we can get started. 
                          Come on, Scouts. We've got work to 
                         do! 
 
                                     BOYS
                         Hooray! 

                                     STAN
                         See ya, Dad!

                         Hey, are you parents gonna stand there 
                         all night? This meeting is for scouts 
                         only, you silly gooses.  Now, before 
                         we get started, scouts, I want to introduce 
                         you to someone very special here tonight. 
                         He's a brave little boy with disabilities 
                         who proves just by being here that Scouts 
                         are for everyone!

                         So let's all give a big round of applause 
                         to little... Jimmy! 
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Oo-well hello everyoneh.

                         Jim- Jim-mih?

               [The bar, nearby. There's some argument going on inside]

                                     STUART
                         Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's 
                         a bad person, I just don't think he 
                         should be a scout leader!
 
                                     RANDY
                         Well he got to where he is by being 
                         a good scout; maybe we should just leave 
                         him alone.
 
                                     MAN
                         Well how gay is he?

                                     STUART
                         He's really, really gay.

                                     TOKEN'S FATHER
                         Well then, I don't want my boy there, 
                         either. 
 
                                     RANDY
                         So he's a homosexual. So what?

                                     STUART
                         I have nothing against homosexuals either, 
                         Randy, but the big camping trip is next 
                         week! Are you sayin' you're fine with 
                         this guy campin' overnight, alone, with 
                         our boys??

                         You know, boys emulate authority figures. 
                         Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they 
                         could end up all talk and all femmit, 
                         prancin' around like girls. 
 
                                     RANDY
                         Aw, that's ridiculous.

                                     PRIEST MAXI
                          People, people, please! You're forgetting 
                         that homosexuality is a choice! As many 
                         of you know, I, myself, went through 
                         a... homosexual... phase. But the light 
                         of Christ showed me how to change. Just 
                         give me two hours with this man, and 
                         I can convert him back.

                          That's what you said about Peterson, 
                         and then you ended up having sex with 
                         him!
 
                                     MAN 3
                          That's right.

                         in case you were wondering, I do have 
                         a disability. I am totally happy with 
                         the way I was born, very much. I travel 
                         to different states and talk to kids 
                         about being proud of what they are.

                         know, sometimes people ask me, "Are 
                         you angry at God for making disabled 
                         people?" I say, "No, I think the world

                         I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops 
                         are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased 
                         to report that we have already raised 
                         over $600 for the event. Yippie!

                         to our attention that you are... gay.

                         Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the 
                         Scouts have a policy that openly gay 
                         men cannot belong.

                         I'm afraid you are hereby... out of 
                         Scouts.

                         Uh you must understand that Scouts is 
                         a private club. A club that follows 
                         certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs 
                         is that homosexuality is immoral.

               off overhead. Jimmy scrambles up on his crutches as Timmy tends 
               to his bitten hand, and strikes Timmy again, and again. Jimmy 
               then swings his legs into Timmy and flies off - a flying kick.

               it into the ground twice, then performing an eye gouge. Jimmy

                         Huh?

                                     BIG GAY AL
                         Look, I appreciate what you kids did; 
                         really, I really do. But this isn't 
                         what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. 
                         And I'm proud to be in a country where 
                         I'm free to express myself. But freedom 
                         is a two-way street. If I'm free to 
                         express myself, then the Scouts have 
                         to be free to express themselves, too. 
                         I know these men. They are good men. 
                         They are kind men. They do what they 
                         think is best for kids. No matter how 
                         wrong we think they might be, it isn't 
                         right for us to force them to think 
                         our way. It's up to us to persuade, 
                         and help them see the light, not extort 
                         them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' 
                         funding. The Scouts help and have always 
                         helped a lot of kids. That's why I love 
                         them. I will continue to persuade them 
                         to change their mind, but this is the 
                         wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby 
                         dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts 
                         their right to not allow gays into their 
                         private club.

                         Hooray, hey!

                                     STAN
                         So wait, did we do good?

                                     BUTTERS
                         Uh yeah, ah I think so.

                          Come on kids, let's go get some ice 
                         cream!

                         Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important 
                         lesson, too, very much. There is room 
                         for more than one handi-capable person 
                         in Scouts.
 
                                     TIMMY
                         Timmih.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm glad we're best friends now. See 
                         ya at Scouts. 
 
                                     TIMMY
                         Tim-mih.

                         Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih 
                         Timmih Timmih.  Timmih Timmih Timmih 
                         Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Aaaaah.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                          Dude, Timmy, come on! We're gonna be 
                         late for Scouts! 
 
               [Park County Community Center, day. Inside the boys are seated 
               around the table, and a new Scoutmaster, the head Scoutmaster, 
               is present]
 
                                     HEAD SCOUTMASTER
                         Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. 
                         Everything is going to be just fine. 
                         No naked pictures.
 
                                     TIMMY
                          Uh, Timmih.

                                     HEAD SCOUTMASTER
                         Yes, Timmy?  Oh dear. Jimmy?

                                     JIMMY
                         Yes?

                                     HEAD SCOUTMASTER
                         You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... 
                         out of Scouts.
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Out of Scouts? 

                                     TIMMY
                          Tim-mih.

               Jimmy	Huh w-what? [the two other Scoutmasters come up behind 
               Jimmy, pull him out of his chair, and carry him towards the entrance] 
               Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
 
                                     STAN
                         Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Me neither. 

                                     JIMMY
                         No! No! 

                                     TIMMY
                          Timmiiih!!!
