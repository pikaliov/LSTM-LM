                         TV, they're gonna say,  "Shit."

                         Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said 
                         "shit!" On television!

                         It's just a marketing ploy by the network. 
                         Like that time they had the first male-to-male 
                         kiss with Terrance and Phillip?

                         Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. 
                         What's the matter? You got some sand 
                         in your vagina?
 
                                     KYLE
                         No, I don't have sand in my vagina! 
                         I just think it's a little immature 
                         for us to be standing around talking 
                         about one dumb word being on TV!

                         Last night, the daring and bold show, 
                         Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying 
                         "SHIT" on television, making "shit" 
                         officially okay to say around the country. 
                          A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans 
                         think the show has pushed the envelope 
                         too far, while a whopping 76% say they 
                         don't really give a shit.  In other 
                         news, a strange virus which causes victims 
                         to vomit up their intestines is making 
                         life shitty for a small farming community.

                         Alright, children, in lieu of the common 
                         usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's 
                         position on the word, "shit."

                         say it on TV it's alright.
 
                                     MS. CHOKSONDIK
                         Yes, but only in the figurative noun 
                         form or the adjective form
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Huh?

                                     MS. CHOKSONDIK
                         You can only use it in the non-literal 
                         sense. For instance,  "That's a shitty 
                         picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, 
                         the literal noun form of  "This is a 
                         picture of shit." is still naughty. 
                         
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't get it.

                                     MS. CHOKSONDIK
                         The adjective form is now also acceptable. 
                         For example:  "The weather outside is 
                         shitty." However, the literal adjective 
                         is NOT appropriate. For example:  "My 
                         bad diarrhea made the inside of the 
                         toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean 
                         it with a rag, which then also became 
                         shitty."  That's right out!

                                     MS. CHOKSONDIK

                         Look, it's all about context. Well, 
                         for example, recently, I have come out 
                         and admitted that I was a homosexual. 
                         I'm gay. That means that now I can say 
                         the word, "fag." On television they 
                         usually don't allow "fag." But because 
                         I'm gay, it's alright. And with the 
                         new approval of the word, "shit," that 
                         means that finally I am free to say,

                         and that means I'm free to use the word

                         around for over 600 years. It comes 
                         from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite."

                         stopped calling it "skite" and started 
                         calling it "shit." The same year as 
                         the Black Plague.

                         the right side of the aircraft you can 
                         see some interesting shit.  And over 
                         on the left side, there's some interesting 
                         shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving 
                         in los Angeles in about two hours. Until 
                         then we invite you to sit back, relax, 
                         and enjoy our shitty service.

                         thought-provoking netertainment. How 
                         great it is that we live in a country 
                         where an artist can express himself 
                         freely. That's not only the American 
                         spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows 
                         us to make great family programs like 
                         Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's 
                         favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank 
                         you enough for bringing your concerns 
                         to our network, for it is you, the loyal 
                         HBC viewer, who makes this great network,

                         And besides, too much use of a dirty 
                         word takes away from its... impact. 
                         We believe in free speech and all that, 
                         but... keeping a few words taboo just 
                         adds to the fun of English.
