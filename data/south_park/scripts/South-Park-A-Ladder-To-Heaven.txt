                          Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's 
                         Candy Shop.

                         We're the kids whose names you called 
                         on your commercial last night. We're 
                         here to do the shopping spree!

                         Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket 
                         stub.

                         Well you know. When you entered the 
                         contest you got the other half of this 
                         ticket.

                         stub, do we?

                         Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you 
                         high?? How else do I know you're the 
                         winners?
 
                                     STAN
                         Because our names were called on the 
                         commercial last night!

                         Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy 
                         shopping spree. If you find it, you 
                         can come back, but you only have one 
                         week to claim the prize. That's called 
                         "The Ticking Clock." Works great in 
                         the movies.

                         that ticket stub. You'll need it to 
                         claim your prize.  Shign up for the 
                         five-minute shopping spree!!

                         lose it.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep 
                         track of it, Kyle.

                         responsibility. Here, you hold on to

                         Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, 
                         where last December, eight-year-old 
                         Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. 
                         But now, that little boy's three closest

                         so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's 
                         what some people had to say.

                         Well, our son just said to us that he 
                         really needed to see his little friend 
                         Kenny again and... and that he thought 
                         it would work...  if he... built the 
                         ladder to heaven.

                          They just believe in their little hearts 
                         that it will work. We can't tell them 
                         it won't, we just can't!

                         "Where Were You When the World Stopped 
                         Turning," about the tragedies on September 
                         11. And now he's here once again to 
                         capitalize on people's emotions. Let's

                         evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there 
                         building weapons of mass destruction. 
                          We have tried to communicate with Saddam 
                         through a psychic to ask him to let

                         Saddam was originally killed, his soul 
                         actually went to hell. But while in 
                         hell he began a homosexual relationship 
                         with Satan, the Prince of Darkness.

                         to be with Hussein anymore and broke 
                         up with him about August.  When Saddam 
                         became jealous and tried to kill Satan's 
                         new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent 
                         to heaven to live with Mormons as a 
                         punishment.  Question?  Yes?

                         ...I've never heard the words "only" 
                         and "candy" in the same sentence before.

                         But... what about yoru lost friend? 
                         What about your fragile innocence and 
                         believing we could all get to heaven?

                         Yeah, well people make us kids believe 
                         that heaven is this white place with 
                         fluffy clouds and angels...

                         Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven 
                         isn't a place you can get to, maybe 
                         heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind 
                         or, or something gay like that. Maybe 
                         heaven... is this moment, right now.

                         So, you're saying we should bomb this 
                         moment, right now. Right! Johnson!

                         No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These 
                         boys are right. The only heaven we can 
                         hope for is one here on earth, now. 
                         We should stop waiting to get into heaven 
                         and start trying to... create it.

                          And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam 
                         could actually be up there buildin' 
                         bombs.

                         Where were you when they decided heaven 
                         was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, 
                         you couldn't really get there?

                         Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul 
                         is still in Cartman's body.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          No no, I just drank his memories. I'm 
                         not sharing my body with that poor piece 
                         of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat 
                         dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.

                         Keep those nitrogen capsules over there 
                         by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come 
                         on!

                          Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that 
                         you're secretly building weapons of 
                         mass destruction up here.

                         Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This 
                         is a chocolate chip factory. See? 
 
                         
                                     GOD
                         It looks like a chemical weapons plant.

                         Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build 
                         a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't 
                         make it look like a chemical weapons 
                         plant, would I? I'd make it look like 
                         a chocolate chip factory or something.
 
                         
                                     GOD
                         ...Alright, just checking.
