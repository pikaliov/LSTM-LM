                         this bright blue light filled the room 
                         . Then slowly my bedroom door begin 
                         to open  and the next thing I remember 
                         I was being drug through a hallway. 
                          Then these scary hands wanted to operate 
                         on me.  And they had big heads and big 
                         black eyes...

                         And then we had a big hit with "Get 
                         Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian". But 
                         then of course, there's our signature
