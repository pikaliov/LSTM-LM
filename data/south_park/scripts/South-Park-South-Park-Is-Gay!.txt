               [South Park, school bus stop, morning. Stan, Cartman and Kenny 
               wait for the bus. Stan is dressed in fishnet tank top, artsy 
               pants, and a new, furry cap with the same colors as his old one. 
               Cartman is dressed in a Madonna fashion shirt and artsy pants. 
               His hair is tussled and brighter than usual. Kenny is dressed 
               in a purple parka with light purple sleeves. A lock of his hair 
               peeks out from under the hood.]

                         what happened to me last night.

                         So, I'm watching the season premiere 
                         of Boy Meets Boy on television, and 
                         then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy 
                         come on, right? So I fall asleep in 
                         front of the TV, and when I wake up, 
                         I see that I've spilled the Coke I was 
                         drinking all over my satin pajama top.

                         Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was 
                         the cutest top ever!

                         Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really 
                         the hot fabric this fall!

                         wear.

                         neck. Are you using any exfoliating 
                         products at all??
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         We can't let Kyle out in public like 
                         this, you guys.

                         The boys take Kyle to a clothing store 
                         and give him some suits to try out. 
                         They choose an outfit and haul him off 
                         to the next store, a barbershop. A woman 
                         styles Kyle's hair. Next is a pedicure. 
                         Kyle wears the outfit Kenny chose. Next 
                         stop: Forever 16, and finally Marcy's. 
                         Next, all four of them are getting facials. 
                         The last scene is of the four boys walking 
                         down the middle of the street, all dressed 
                         in new clothes. Cartman takes off his 
                         shades and the camera enters his eye]

                         My goodness, there certainly are a lot 
                         of gay shows on television these days.

                         Yeah. I think it's great that gays are 
                         finally being so accepted.

                         Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight,

                         times a day. This is the greatest thing

                         Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly 
                         acting like being gay was cool. I mean, 
                         maybe we're not the only gay couple 
                         in town anymore.

                         Well, like with our slang. Black people 
                         always used to say, "I'm in the house" 
                         instead of "I'm here." But then white 
                         people all started to say "in the house" 
                         so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." 
                         Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then 
                         white folk started saying that, and 
                         we had to change it to hizzie, then 
                         "in the hizzle" which we had to change 
                         to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because 
                         white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," 
                         we have to say "flippity floppity floop."

                         You see, at first we liked having our 
                         men be clean and neat. We thought that 
                         having them use product in their hair 
                         and wanting facials would make them 
                         sexier. But it doesn't.
