                         We thank God for our blessings this 
                         Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, 
                         and perfect, and nothing will ever tear 
                         us apart.  I'll get it.

                         My wife and I had a child a few years 
                         back, and, we weren't ready to have 
                         a child, so we put him up for adoption. 
                          We were told that you might be the-

                         I I'm not sure.

                         It was a tough time for us. It was a 
                         tough time for all of Canada. The whole 
                         country was devastated by the cola wars. 
                         It just seemed we couldn't take care 
                         of a baby.

                         So we put him up for adoption. But as 
                         the years passed, I, I just felt an 
                         emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good 
                         to see him.
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and 
                         Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think 
                         it would be best for Ike if you didn't 
                         come around again.
 
                                     ELISE
                         I don't think you understand. We didn't 
                         come to visit Peter, we came to take 
                         him back.
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         What?

                                     HARRY
                         We want to take Peter home, to Canada.

                         Are you crazy?!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just 
                         change your mind.
 
                                     HARRY
                         Changing your mind is a Canadian custom 
                         that we hold quite dear. And besides, 
                         the new Canadian Prime Minister has 
                         issued a decree that all adopted Canadians 
                         must be returned home.

                         He doesn't belong here. He belongs in 
                         Canada with his own kind.

                         I think you'd better leave.

                         Please, don't make things any harder 
                         for Peter.

                         Harder for Peter?! Now you two just 
                         blow in here and say you're gonna haul 
                         him back to Canada, and we're being 
                         hard on Peter?!
 
                                     HARRY
                         We're prepared to go to court! We had 
                         hoped it wouldn't come to that!

                         The new Prime Minister of Canada has 
                         authority this court cannot override.

                         that case to the new Canadian Prime 
                         Minister. What if this Christmas, instead 
                         of buyin' presents, we all use that 
                         money to give to the Broflovskis?

                         Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again 
                         trying to take over our beloved Canada 
                         like he did before.

                         Wait a minute. This means all the Prime 
                         Minister's new laws are null and void.

                         Perhaps we were wrong to try and take 
                         Peter back. He doesn't belong here. 
                         He belongs with his family.

               and throw confetti. Saddam is paraded on his own float, with 
               huge candy canes around him]
 
                                     CANADIANS

               Now Canada is free for you and you and me

               It's the best Christmas presents we ever got

               Canadian Christmas, it's the best! We drink and dance and show 
               our breasts!
