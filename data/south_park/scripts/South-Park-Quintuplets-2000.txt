                         Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted 
                         to see Cirque du Cheville.

                         No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. 
                         They get acrobats and singers from all 
                         over the world and then do very artistic

               and drop down again. The parents are still in thrall, and their 
               eyes follow the dancers' leaps. Cartman is now asleep. Some time 
               elapses, and a singer sings her song. The other three boys are 
               getting sleepy. The smiles are gone from the parents' faces. 
               The singer is shown with a two-person high-wire act overhead. 
               Little "birds" pop out from her dress and dance around. A new 
               act appears, and Stan is falling asleep on his left hand. Kyle 
               and Kenny seem more awake. An invisible man in a visible suit 
               walks on, and a clown jumps out of the floor in front of him. 
               The clown and the man shake hands, and the clown rips the man's 
               right arm off. A new act comes on, and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny 
               are really drowsy. The curtains open to reveal five girls, and 
               they come forward to dance]

                         here. Why don't you all stay here in
