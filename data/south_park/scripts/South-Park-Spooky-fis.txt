               for the western U.S. As it enters the atmosphere it begins to 
               burn. It slows down and hovers over a road, then lands gently. 
               A door opens like a camera lens, and an alien drops down. As 
               soom as he moves, a tire crushes him. Judging by the size of 
               the tire, the alien was 18 to 24 inches tall. The tire is that 
               of the South Park Elementary school bus, which stops to let the 
               boys off. Then it pulls away.]

                         I had to stay home because my mother 
                         wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, 
                         and I wanted to take care of the house 
                         so she could stay in bed.  I just wanted 
                         to catch you guys to see if we were 
                         assigned any homework tonight.

                         buy pumpkins to carve.

                         contest! I'll run home and get money 
                         from Mother. Do you guys need some,

                         at the spooky fish. After a long while, 
                         the fish turns around and starts writing 
                         something on the tank wall with his 
                         tail. Stan gets out of bed for a closer 
                         look. The fish finishes writing and 
                         turns to blow on the wall. A gray area 
                         appears and the word "KILL" appears 
                         within it.]

               growing pool of blood next ot him. The fish again looks down

                         Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering 
                         if you had seen any of them.

                         around the back yard, though?

                         Missing people usually turn up hiding 
                         in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this

                         you a lot more than in my evil, parallel

                         such a bad, little squash. It just needs 
                         some tender, loving care.
