                         Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Maybe he caught a disease and died. 
                         That'd be so awesome.
 
                                     STAN
                         Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't 
                         joke about that.

                         No. This Saturday, for my birthday, 
                         my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa 
                         Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite 
                         three friends!.

                         Dude, haven't you ever been there?! 
                         It's a big Mexican restaurant where 
                         they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black 
                         Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!

                                     CARTMAN
                         You... your Mom said you could take 
                         three friends.

                         the hell else are you gonna take besides

                         I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me 
                         to his birthday party last month, so 
                         I owe him one.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butthole?! 
                         Why?!

                         I have never been a dick to you.

                          Oh please! All you ever do is call 
                         me names and rip on me for being Jewish!

                         Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you 
                         for being a Jew?

               [in the playground. Craig is there instead of Kenny] Oh yeah?! 
               Well you're a stupid Jew!
 
               [in the playground, by the school's back doors] You're a Jew!
 
               
               [in Cartman's room. Cartman is wearing a crown] Shut your God-damned 
               Jew mouth!
 
               [at Kyle's house, on the front steps] Good job, Jew!

               [singing the Dreidl song with Kyle's family and Stan] Jew...
 
               
               [leaving his seat in class] Shutup Jew!

               [at Cartman's house, with outfits] You're Jewish!!

               [seated on a curb with the other boys] Dude, he's Jewish!

               [staking out a house] Jew!

               [on Nightline, seated next to Stan] Jew!

               [in Cartman's dining room] Jew!

               [at the side of a road, with Tweek and with their parents] Jew!
 
               
               [next to stacks of lumber, as Kyle is about to whack him] Jew!
 
               
               [at a barn, through a hole on the roof] Jew!

               [Stan's room. Kyle reads a Bible] Jew?!

               [At the Costa Rican rainforest, during practice] "I told you 
               Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman"

                          Okay, except maybe for that one time.

                         You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, 
                         and I'm not inviting you. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita 
                         is my most favorite place  in the whole 
                         world. I'll just, I'll just die if you 
                         don't take me! Please!

                          Sorry, my mind's made up.

                          Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna 
                         go to your faggy birthday party anyway! 
                         I'd much rather hang out at home than 
                         have to be around you and your Jew mom 
                         for a day!  Kiss my ball, asshole!! 
                          Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. 
                         Ah I really really wanna go to Casa 
                         Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight 
                         just now. You know, I mean, I said some 
                         things, you said some things, but, I 
                         think it was good and we we've moved 
                         past it.

                         I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.

                         I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't 
                         go.
 
                                     CARTMAN

                          That isn't it, Cartman.

                         What isn't it?

                         That's not being nice! That's just putting

                         I need your help on something.

                         Well, sure, Eric. W-w-waht seems to 
                         be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and 
                         you seem to be really good with people, 
                         so, I was wondering if you could tell 
                         me, how "do" you act nice to people?

                         Well, the best thing is not to act nice, 
                         Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely 
                         nice.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice 
                         to people?
 
                                     JIMMY
                         Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is 
                         just making people smile and laugh. 
                         The best way to do that is by telling 
                         a fan-tastic joke or a humorius anti-d- 
                         ant'duhh ...antecdote.

                         Like what?

                                     JIMMY
                         Well, like, try this one on for size: 
                         Knock knock.

                         you ever talk bad about Kyle again! 
                          Kyle is my friend! And if you say you 
                         had sex with his mom one more time, 
                         I'm gonna really let you have it! You

                         Do you really think that beating up 
                         a handicapped kid is being nice?

                         I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told 
                         Butters he could go.

                         So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never 
                         meant to make you feel like you didn't 
                         matter at all to me. I know we argue 
                         all the time and I give you tons of 
                         crap, but we've also been through a, 
                         a lot together, and... maybe that alone 
                         doesn't make us friends, but it makes 
                         us something. So, ...whatever, you know, 
                         just... ah I hope... things will be 
                         cool.

                         care that you can't go?

                         to take Butters, but... I hope things 
                         can be cool too.

                         can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take

                         out into space for a school project. 
                         This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught 
                         first sight of something terrible.

                         Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray 
                         that I'm wrong, but, I just want you 
                         to take a look and... see what you think. 
                          Do you see anything?

                         Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your 
                         eyes a minute to adjust.

                         Wyoming and it's on a collision course 
                         for Earth.

                         to tell my parents so they can come

                         We know, but... he hasn't been home 
                         since last night. The police have been 
                         looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank 
                         you. Uh, please, let us know if you 
                         find out anything.

                         Oh Butters!

                                     KYLE
                         Aw dude, weak.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. 
                          Well, let's get going, shall we?
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a 
                         birthday party while Butters is missing.

                         Yeah, it's kinda weird.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, 
                         but, on the other hand, I think Butters 
                         would want us to go. You know Butters...
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Nah, I can't. We should help look for 
                         him.
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         That's very good of you, boys. We can 
                         postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to 
                         keep Butters in the...  In the... depths 
                         of my heart for that long. I sure hope 
                         he... turns up before then.
 
                                     STAN
                         Dude, we should check over at Stark's 
                         Pond. Butters always hangs out over 
                         there. 
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. And then we can try the football 
                         field. 
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         I'll drive you boys. 

                                     CARTMAN
                          Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep 
                         Butters down in that bomb shelter for 
                         a whole week?!

                         All right, folks, this is the little 
                         boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, 
                         also known as Butters. He's been missing 
                         for two days and was last seen at the 
                         school. Let's go find him.

                                     BUTTERS
                         Wuh, wait, well, what happened??

                                     CARTMAN
                          The meteor... struck the Earth sooner 
                         than I predicted. There was no time... 
                         no time...

                                     CARTMAN
                         There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! 
                         People were crawling all over each other 
                         in the streets! It was... awful! When 
                         it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. 
                         The rest of us... walking around in 
                         a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
                         
 
                                     BUTTERS

                                     CARTMAN
                         No Butters!! If you come up, you'll 
                         get infected too! You best wait for 
                         the radiatino level to go down. Probably... 
                         next week sometime. After Saturday. 
                         Ugh...
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          How many survivors are there? You should 
                         all come down here.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         We can't come down there, or else, we'll 
                         contaminate you, Butters. No... we just 
                         have to survive the best we can. 
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough 
                         for everything you've done for me.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... 
                         rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, 
                         wait one week for the toxic levels to 
                         go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All 
                         right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.

                         Tom, it has now been three days since 
                         the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople 
                         continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.

                         All right, folks. I wanna thank you 
                         for all your efforts. Three days is 
                         a long time, but we've got to keep going 
                         if we're gonna find him.

                         until after Saturday when I go to Casa 
                         Bonita.

                         Many times in cases like these a child 
                         can trap themselves. It is important 
                         that we spread our search to duct pipes, 
                         wells, and bomb shelters.

                         ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's 
                         move out, people! Every second counts!

                         gone mad! Those of us who survived are

                         radiation! Hey wait! We can use this 
                         box!  There we go. This should keep 
                         you protected from the toxins.

                         bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings,
