               [The bus stop, morning. The boys are dreassed in Union blue. 
               Stan bears the flag, Kyle and Kenny have fifes, and Cartman carries 
               a drum.]

                         Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, 
                         I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!

                         You can't just "hit" a drum, you have 
                         to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you 
                         butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you 
                         fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, 
                         dude.

                         You're not supposed to rock, you're 
                         supposed to keep the beat!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         I ma keepin' the beat; your flute-playing

                         drummer!
 
                                     CARTMAN

                         Alrighty everyone. We just have a few 
                         things to go over before we head out 
                         to the reenactment battlefield.  First 
                         of all, I have great news. There are 
                         over 200 folks from around the state 
                         that have come to see this year's reenactment, 
                         and that's the best turnout ever!
 
                         
                                     MEN
                          Yes! Woohoo, yea!

                                     STAN
                         Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses 
                         the orientation, they're not gonna lethim 
                         in the reenactment. 
 
                                     KYLE
                         He'll show.

                         I'm also very proud to announce that 
                         this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's 
                         S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps 
                         with the delightful taste of s'mores.

                         Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.

                                     STUART
                          Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick,

                         And now, to clarify how the reenctment 
                         should unfold, let's bring up our master 
                         historian, Grnandpa Marvin Marsh,  the 
                         only man old enough to have actually 
                         seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.

                         Yes. This year, I've decided to fight 
                         for the glorious South. Screw you guys, 
                         home. And may I say that we're going

                         fire your blanks into the air, and if 
                         someone says they killed ya, you gotta 
                         play dead.

                         reenactment we've got to pretend down 
                         to the last detail that we're really 
                         in the Civil War. So when the North 
                         wins, all of us on the Confederate side 
                         should act all bummed and depressed.

                         Welcome to the South Park reenactment 
                         of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The 
                         men in gray are the Confederacy, fron 
                         the South ; in blue are the Union, from 
                         the North .

                          It was a cold morning in 1862. The 
                         Union Army had to get the bell of Appmattox 
                         down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued 
                         was a bloody battle, but after many 
                         hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here 
                         now is the reenactment of that great 
                         battle.

                         Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do 
                         the entire reenactment again, because 
                         of some confusion over the bell. Now, 
                         I know you're just trying to help, Eric, 
                         but we have to let the Union capture 
                         the bell this time.

                         lose.

                         But we don't have to lose.

                          Gentlemen, we can win this battle! 
                          Sure, we could lose, and tonight we 
                         can go back to our families and say, 
                         "We did it! We lost like we were supposed 
                         to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take 
                         that hill. We take that hill, and when 
                         we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads 
                         high, and we yell, "Not this year! This 
                         year belongs to the Confederaseh!"

                         for 22 years now. And for 22 years us 
                         Confederate reenacters have had to spend 
                         the evening being ridiculed and made 
                         fun of by the Union reenacters! Well,

                         the bet was that the South doesn't win

                         the Confederates would have just gotten 
                         their asses kicked in Topeka!

                         That ain't true! The Confederates would 
                         have shupped ass in Topeka, too!

                          Perhaps we should take Topeka.

                         They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They 
                         think the South is a joke. They don't 
                         respect our authoritah.

                         No. I say we take Topeka.

                          You know what? I'll bet we could take 
                         Topeka right now and clear them all 
                         around!

                         That's right! Maybe we should do what 
                         the Confederates would've done and march 
                         on to Topeka!

                         Dear Ms. McCormick

               
               It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your 
               son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on 
               the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. 
               This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your 
               son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share 
               your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and 
               make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate 
               them so very very much.
 
               
               Yours,

               General Cartman Lee 

               [The Confederate camp. The men relax and talk. Stan, Kyle, Grandpa,

                         and by morning they're all gonna wanna 
                         go home.

                         Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South 
                         Carolina. That's where the Civil War 
                         really escalated.

                         Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we 
                         shall go.

                         Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna 
                         get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?

                         cookies? Those frosty ones with the 
                         sprinkles on 'em.

                          That can't be.

                          Ned, I think I can say without any 
                         doubt that that was the longest drinking 
                         binge we've ever had.

                         get home before our wives leave us.

                         something today. You've learned that 
                         you can't rewrite history.  You see, 
                         history is forever,  and everything 
                         happens for a reason.  Sure, you can 
                         try and change the past, but usually 
                         you kno-

                         Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities 
                         tried to drive out the Union occupants 
                         of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham 
                         Lincoln's administration would not surrender 
                         the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson 
                         Davis decided to take action.
