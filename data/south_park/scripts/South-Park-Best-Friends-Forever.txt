                          Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game 
                         machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. 
                         I have to be the first to get one!

                         after school! We're outsmarting everyone 
                         by getting to the store right when it 
                         opens! Let's go!

                         faces when I show up to school with 
                         a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh 
                         PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!

               waiting for the PSP. The camera reaches the front of the line 
               only to find Kenny right at the front door. He's the first one 
               in line. Cartman approaches Kenny]

                         in line.

                          It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." 
                         Kenny commands the armies of heaven 
                         against the forces of Satan.  Dude, 
                         you see what Kenny got?

                         he's really good at.

               park with his family, still playing with his PSP, then in "The 
               Mine Shaft" roller coaster, where he reaches lever 45. He's seen 
               on the bus playing on his PSP while the other students are having 
               fun, then in Le Bijou playing while Stan and Kyle watch a movie, 
               then on the sidewalk passing some hot babes - he doesn't look 
               up to acknowledge them, then in his bed again at night. He reaches 
               lever 54.]

                         with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two 
                         weeks and you've done nothin' else!

                         sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny!

                         dead, but, your death was no accident. 
                         Heaven needs you.

                         Come! There is much to discuss.  Things 
                         are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan 
                         is planning a massiva attack and he 
                         knows we are too few in number to stop 
                         him! God has changed the rules here. 
                         For ages, only Mormons were allowed 
                         into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell 
                         was becoming much larger, God decided 
                         to let more people cross over so that 
                         he could build an army as well, an army 
                         that YOU must command.
 
                                     KENNY

                                     PETER
                         The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine 
                         who on Earth had the best skills to 
                         defeat the armies of Satan. You... are 
                         the best. YOU, are the only hope for 
                         the universe.

                         Satan's army grows as we speak. The 
                         Dark Lord knows that our armies are 
                         few in number, and unorgamized. So our 
                         only hope... is perfect strategy.

                                     PETER
                         He beat Satan's army in over three thousand 
                         separate simulations.
 
                                     ANGEL 4

                          The child did something none of us 
                         could: Reach lever sixty on the PSP. 
                         Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverence, 
                         but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, 
                         Kenny, let me show you what we're up 
                         against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. 
                         Satan's armies will attack the gate 
                         ...here. They are... ten billion in 
                         number. Maybe more.  Our armies are 
                         here, here, and here. Just under... 
                         ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered 
                         and in need of someone who can singlehandedly 
                         bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, 
                         Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves.

                         of Kenny's brain cells died from lack 
                         of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in

                         I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be 
                         repaied once dead. But his soul is still 
                         in here.  Almost... trapped in here, 
                         if you will. Kenny is the same as he 
                         ever was. It's just that, now, he's 
                         more like ...a tomato.

                         A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient 
                         paste directly into Kenny's stomache. 
                         With it we can actually keep Kenny the 
                         tomato alive for years.

                         be kept alive via feeding tube.
