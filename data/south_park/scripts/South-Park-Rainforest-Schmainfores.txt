               kids in yellow G.G.W.K. shirts stands next to Garrison]
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, children, we have a special guest 
                         today, a woman recruiting young people 
                          for a national choir tour. Now I know 
                         that choir tours are totally stupid 
                         and lame , but please, give her your 
                         full attention.  Go ahead.
 
                                     CHOIR TEACHER
                         Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are 
                         we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! 
                         I said, How are we all doing?! 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Eric Cartman, you say "excuse me"!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Go ahead.

                         Children, we are a national choir called, 
                         "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna 
                         do a big tour down in Central America 
                         to help save the rainforest, and you 
                         can be a part of it!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're 
                         spoken to!!  Go ahead.
 
                                     CHOIR TEACHER
                         You see, we take kids from all over 
                         the country and put them in a choir 
                          where we sing and dance to raise awareness 
                         about our vanishing rainforest.

                          Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest 
                         are bolldozed every year?
 
                                     CHOIR GIRL
                          That's right. And over 30% of the world's 
                         oxygen  is made in the rainforest. 
 
                         
                                     CHOIR TEACHER
                         So, who wants to join the fun??

                         What if you don't have any rhythm?
 
                         
                                     CHOIR TEACHER
                         Excuse me?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, 
                         so he doesn't have any rhythm.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Shut up, fatass!

                         Choirs suck.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! 
                         Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! 
                         Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! 
                         Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! 
                          Go ahead.
 
                                     CHOIR TEACHER
                         Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if 
                         anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest 
                         and joining our choir, I'll leave information 
                         packets up front.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet 
                         paper. 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         All right, that does it!!

                          I am tired of seeing you in my office, 
                         young man!  You get sent here every 
                         day, Craig!

                         I know.

                         Why can't you behave?

                         ...I don't know.

                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         What do you have to say for yourself?! 
                          Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, 
                         you're gonna be held back a grade if 
                         you don't luh-  Did you just flip me 
                         off?
 
                                     CRAIG
                         No.

                         Yes you did, you just flipped me the 
                         bird! Now, see? This is exactly what 
                         I'm talking about! If you don't shape 
                         up, mkay, and get your head straight, 
                         uh-  There! You just flipped me off 
                         again!

                         No I didn't.

                         Yes you did! And until you stop flipping 
                         people off, you can just go back to 
                         the waiting room, mkay?! Next!  Well, 
                         well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, 
                         Kenny, and Eric.

                         Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What 
                         did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? 
                         "The boys were being rude while a choir 
                         teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         It's just some dumb activist kids' choir 
                         thing.
 
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" 
                         is not dumb, mkay? It just so happens 
                         that I'm on the board of directors.

                         Dude! All those choirs are the same. 
                         They don't even really sing. They use 
                         prerecorded tapes.
 
                                     COUNSELOR MACKEY
                         Well, guess what, boys? I think that 
                         "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what 
                         you need. I'm gonna sign up all four 
                         of you.

                         You can't do that!

                         Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. 
                         Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.

                         We must take only pictures and leave 
                         only footprints.

                         are tearing down thousands of acres 
                         of rainforest every day?

                         ready to head for the Latin American 
                         nation of Costa Rica, a country filled 
                         with virgin rainforest.

               [The bus rolls along. A map pops up, showing the bus's route, 
               and Latin music plays. It croses the border at Mexicali, goes 
               down the Baja peninsula, takes a ferry to Mexico and cuts across 
               the North to the Gulf, then snakes down Central America to Costa 
               Rica. They arrive at San José.]

                         San José, which is the capital of Costa

                         Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. 
                         These people are much poorer than those 
                         in the U.S.

                          Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking 
                         off, and get a job! What's wrong with 
                         you?! Go to college!

                         people or they just slack off and be 
                         poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe 
                         that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa

                         you respect other cultures this instant!

                         makes you appreciate living in America,

                         You may think that making fun of Third-World

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't think it's funny! This place 
                         is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's 
                         not funny, that sucks!

                         Because I'll buy you some ice cream

                         Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad 
                         I say, "Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!" and 
                         I smack him on the head!

                         but I guess we should be getting back. 
                         We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't 
                         we, kids?!

                                     CHOIR TEACHER
                         The Yanogapa are gentle native people 
                         that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers 
                         are destroying their homes. Soon, they 
                         will have nowhere to go. So we must 
                         stop bulldozing the rainforest so that 
                         they can live-!

                         snake. Notice the red markings. Quite 
                         an amazing creature.

                                     PABLO
                         Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake 
                         is more afraid of us than we are of 
                         it. 
 
               Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops 
               the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls]

                         much,  I'm only going to get my heart 
                         broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends 
                         of the country.  Once this choir tour 
                         is over, we'll never see each other 
                         again.  And that would devastate me.

               world!
 
               There are over seven

               hundred things in the

               Rainforest that cause cancer.

               [Man joins her] World!

               Join the fight now and help

               stop the Rainforest before

               it's too late.

               
               [Chorus]

               Getting Gay With Kids is here!

               To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!

               [Move to E flat] Getting Gay With Kids is here!

               Let's knock down the rainforest! What do you say?!

               It's totally gay! It's totally gay!
