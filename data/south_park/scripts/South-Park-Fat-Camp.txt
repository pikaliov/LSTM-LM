                         Alright, children, as I'm sure you all 
                         remember, today we are going to continue 
                         our biology lesson... b dissecting an 
                         organism.

                         Yeah! 

                                     BEBE, NEW KUD
                         Woohoo.

                                     MS. CHOKSONDIK
                          Now, what we are going to dissect today 
                         is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees 
                         are mammals that live in the oceans 
                         and are often called the gentle clowns 
                         of the sea.
 
                                     WENDY
                         Aha, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees 
                         endangered?
 
                                     MS. CHOKSONDIK
                         They sure are, Wendy, and that's why 
                         we must learn what's inside them.  Now, 
                         we don't have quite enough  manatees 
                         to go around, so I think we're gonna 
                         have to split up into groups of four.

                         incision will be along the abdomen.

                         you had this... talent?

                         the one that does it all, but we were 
                         the masterminds of the whole thing.

                         Look at what you've done to my boy! 
                         You told Horace that he was responsible 
                         for his weight! You made him believe 
                         that with exercise and proper diet, 
                         he could be thin! When we told you it 
                         was his genetics!

                         of there.  Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe 
                         you could give him a little push. 
 
                         
                                     AUDIENCE
                         OOOOHHHHHH!

                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         He's dead. The pressure must have killed 
                         him.
 
                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         I told you I was a tight virgin flower.

                         of.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s 
                         look-alike. You bastards!
 
                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Well, he gave his life for our amusement. 
                         One little boy who dared to be different. 
                         Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. 
                          Who was that?
 
               THE END
