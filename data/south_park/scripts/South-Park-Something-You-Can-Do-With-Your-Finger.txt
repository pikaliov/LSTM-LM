                          Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign 
                         from God. That's it, isn't it? You want 
                         me to start a boy band so I can make 
                         $10 million, don't you? That's it!

                         is the beginning of a great time in 
                         our lives.  God has finally spoken to 
                         me, you guys. And he has told me how 
                         I can make $10 million.

                         music we can sing to, just like they 
                         do. All we need to do is practice our

                         cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. 
                         And I would uh, I'd hate to have to 
                         move it off to the side for a while. 
                         What?

                         No. I mean, you're just not as good 
                         as sausage and cheese.

                          Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
 
                         
                                     CHEF
                         Wellll, if you uuhh, come back in just 
                         a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can 
                         help you out.

                          Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying

                         Chef, God told me I was to start a boy 
                         band and make $10 million. The problem 
                         is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel 
                         the music burning inside me. But I just 
                         can't express it right, you know?

                         focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy 
                         bands aren't about music, Boy bands 
                         are created by corporations to make 
                         money. They're all based on the Gomlich 
                         effect.

                                     CHEF
                         The law of physics that states, "If 
                         one girl screams for something, it will 
                         make other girls scream. And then, it 
                         grows exponentiously until all girls 
                         within a five-mile radius are screaming."

                         All they do is make videos, showing 
                         tons and tons of girls screaming for 
                         the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, 
                         you can't stop 'em. They're crazih!

                         and the money, the womenÂ—all it did 
                         was build me up, so that I could be 
                         knocked down harder than anybody in 
                         the world.  That is what being in a 
                         boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's 
                         people smothering you and embracing 
                         you and loving you and then ssspitting 
                         you out and throwing you away like you 
                         were last night's pork chops! Now we

                                     RANDY
                         Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a 
                         little.
 
                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Can I get your autograph?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Ok- Okay okay

                                     VETERAN GUARD
                          Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am!
 
                         
                                     LITTLE GIRL
                          I actually don't really know who they 
                         are, I was just getting an autograph 
                         and-  A-a-aaa-a-aaah!
 
                                     VETERAN GUARD
                         Move along, ma'am.  Eh, that was pretty 
                         good, kids. Maybe you can come perform 
                         at my Elks Club sometime.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, yeah, maybe.  God. Now it's like 
                         everybody wants a piece of us.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't know if I can handle all this 
                         fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna 
                         become famous, but now that I am, I 
                         don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably 
                         can't even walk through this mall right 
                         now without people goin', "Oh my God, 
                         it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         ...Yeah. That's gonna suck.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. 
                         Have a normal life and appreciate what 
                         I have.
 
                                     RANDY
                          Well, I think you boys are very smart 
                         for your age. Come on. I'll buy you 
                         all an orange smoothie. 
 
                                     STAN
                         I don't think they sell those anymore. 
                         
 
                                     KYLE
                         Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting 
                         mad at you for not making $10 million? 
                         
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. 
                         He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', 
                         right? Heheyeah. 
 
               THE END
