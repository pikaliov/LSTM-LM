                         Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to 
                         kick off the 14th Annual South Park 
                         Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow 
                         Days is when we all get together to 
                         celebrate and thank the noble, gentle 
                         cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow 
                         Days, Jimbo Kern!
 
                                     JIMBO
                          This year is a very special Cow Days 
                         because we are revealing our all-new 
                         Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever 
                         in South Park from this day forth. Release 
                         the curtain!

                         Now, Mary, this is our only vacation 
                         for years. We have to make the best 
                         of it
 
                                     MARY
                         Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We 
                         just need to stay positive.

                         have decided to run against the cows 
                         through town do so at their own risk.

                         three people died in last year's Running 
                         of the Cows.  With that said, let's 
                         rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run? 
                          Release the cows!  They're loose!
