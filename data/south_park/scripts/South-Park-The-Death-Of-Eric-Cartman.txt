                         Now, Butters, there's no such thing 
                         as ghosts.

                         Butters, these things happen all the 
                         time. You've got a very active little 
                         brain and your mind was just playing 
                         tricks on you.

                         my ima... magination then?
 
                                     STEPHEN
                         That's right. There's no reason to be 
                         afraid of things that aren't real. There's 
                         plenty of real things to be scared of. 
                         Like super-AIDS.

                         That's right. A new form of AIDS which 
                         is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon 
                         of super-AIDS in your butt and you're 
                         dead in three years.

                         So now you feel better? Ghosts don't 
                         exist and there's nothing to be afraid 
                         of. Except the super-AIDS.

                         is trapped here on Earth. I can't find

                         go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' 
                         on him for bein' black.

                         for him.

                         He probably thinks if he apologizes 
                         to everyone, we'll think he's changed 
                         and let him back into our circle.

                          Aww, that's okay, Eric.

                                     CARTMAN
                          Well, it's all done. My soul is at 
                         peace. I think... I can go now.

                          G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better 
                         place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime!

                         Well, well, you know, the preacher says 
                         that before your soul can be at peace, 
                         sometimes, you have to atone for something 
                         bad you did.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Atone?

                         Did you ever do anything really bad?

                         Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's 
                         fence and never told him about it.

                         I took a crap in the principal's purse... 
                         seven times. Then there was the time 
                         I convinced a woman to have an abortion 
                         so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. 
                         I pretended to be retarded and joined 
                         the Special Olympics. I tried to have 
                         all the Jew exterminated last spring. 
                         Uuh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid 
                         whose parents I had killed and then 
                         made into chili which I fed to the kid.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS

                         atone for.

                         Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know 
                         how you're gonna make up for all this.

                         I know how.

               [Moments later Cartman's hands are shown placing fruits inside 
               a basket, a pair os scissors cutting away at a thick transparent 
               plastic sheet, then the whole basket sealed with a bow. He and 
               Butters grin at the accomplishment. Behind them are some more 
               baskets roady to go. The first basket goes to Principal Victoria. 
               The second goes to Ms. Claridge. The third goes to the rabbi 
               at the synagogue. The congregation there is surprised. The fourth 
               goes to Scott Tenorman, who's sobbing at his parents' graves. 
               Butters and Cartman walk to their next desitnation with another 
               basket as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look on from across the street. 
               They deliver that basket to the abortion clinic. He records the 
               song below, with Butters and a recording engineer in the booth. 
               Next, he and Butters are repairing Mr. Anderson's fence. Cartman 
               hammers the new boards in place as Butters removes the damaged 
               boards. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny appear and watch. Kyle angrily 
               rejects what he's seeing and they walk away. Cartman and Butters 
               then go to the Special Olympics stadium and present a basket 
               to the coordinators. They leave a basket at Sally Struther's 
               door. They're then back in Butters' bedroom and Butters marks 
               off the last atonement.]

                         Your son is suffering from severe dementia. 
                         He claims that the ghost of a dead friend 
                         talks to him. This is usually a sign 
                         of schizophrenia brought on by some 
                         tragic event in the child's past. I 
                         think it's best that we take him to 
                         the mental center and do some tests.

                         Well, after fourteen hours of testing, 
                         I can say Butters is definitely suffering 
                         from aggravated repressied memory syndrome. 
                         You see, Butters, when the brain wants 
                         to cover something up, it makes up images 
                         and sounds for you to hear.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get 
                         you out of here.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom 
                         is really sore.

                         I found the woman you need to talk to 
                         for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert 
                         in the paranormal. She can tell us what 
                         to do!
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Eric, ye-you're just an image in my 
                         head brought on by a traumatic event.

                                     BUTTERS
                          Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?

                                     PSYCHIC
                         Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and 
                         tell me what it is you seek.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Well, there's this ghost, see? Only 
                         it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just 
                         a delusion brought on by my trauma. 
                         Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, 
                         find out why his spirit is wanderin' 
                         the Earth, even though I know that I'm 
                         most likely just completely insane.

                         Well, many times, the reason that the 
                         sould stays Earth-bound is because God 
                         is intending to use that soul for a 
                         divine purpose, to help prevent an impending 
                         tragic event.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Of course. That's it, Butters! We had 
                         it wrong all the time!

                         crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the 
                         time.

                         A tragic event is unfolding in South 
                         Park. Three convicted murderers have 
                         escaped from jail and are holding twelve 
                         people at the Red Cross!

                         Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested 
                         when they ran inside the Red Cross behind 
                         me, and threatened to kill all the workers 
                         inside. The violent men are demanding 
                         a helicopter and two hundred thousand 
                         dollars cash.

                         is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters.

                         first. Give me thirty seconds in there, 
                         and then you go in and free the hostiages.
