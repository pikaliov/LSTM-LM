                         I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus

               Over at the park by where he lives

               I tell him all my problems [the cantor is shown at the pulpit]
 
               
               And sometimes he tells me his

               
               What a friend I have in Jesus [Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are shown]
 
               
               I can say that honestly [other townsfolk are shown]

               He's not like all my other friends

               Who really don't care about me.

               Amen.

                         m'kay. A very present help in trouble, 
                         m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear,

                         my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's 
                         obligation to stick his boneration in 
                         a woman's separation.  This sort of 
                         penetration will increase the population 
                         of the younger generation."

                         waters thereof roar and be troubled,

                         Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. 
                         Today, we're going to talk about hell. 
                          Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, 
                         searing, flames. Screaming, torture. 
                         For eternity. Once you are in hell, 
                         you cannot escape. You live forever 
                         in horrible pain, in burning agony. 
                         All sinners are there in misery, dying 
                         over and over and over.  If you be cast 
                         down into this black bog of stench, 
                         then woe is thou,  for Satan has made 
                         it the most miserable place in the universe! 
                          And he will be your ruler!  Your rulet 
                         of pain and agony!

                         check on the counter. 
 
                                     SATAN
                         Okay, Chris.

                                     SADDAM
                         Satan, look: I know our relationship 
                         wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I 
                         was too busy tryin' to take over the 
                         world to give you what you needed. But 
                         I've changed, Satan. 
 
                                     SATAN
                          Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before.
 
                         
                                     SADDAM
                         COME ON, can't we just go out for a 
                         burrito?  ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!

                         I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.
 
                         
                                     SADDAM
                         Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your 
                         ass like I can!
 
                                     SATAN
                         Good-bye, Saddam!

                                     SADDAM
                         Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, 
                         you can't deny what's between us.  You 
                         can try, but you know we belong together.

                         me well. You and I are through. Good-bye.

                         Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And 
                         I'll be teaching you so that you can 
                         all receive your First Communion.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                          Are we gonna go to hell?

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         Well, hopefully not. That's why you're 
                         gonna need to receive Communion.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         A- And as long as we get this Communion 
                         thing, we're safe?
 
                                     STAN
                         What if we haven't really done anything 
                         that horribly bad in our lives.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, what if we haven't?

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         It doesn't matter, because we are all 
                         born with Original Sin. Now, let me 
                         explain how Communion works.  The priest 
                         will give you this round cracker,  and 
                         he will say, "The Body of Christ," and 
                         then you eat it. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Jesus was made of crackers?

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         No.

                                     STAN
                         But crackers are his- body.

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         Yes.

                                     KENNY
                          (What?!)

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed 
                         bread and said, "eat this, for it is 
                         my body."
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         So wwe won't go to hell as long as we 
                         eat crackers.
 
                                     SISTER ANNE
                         Nononono!

                         Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
 
                         
                                     SISTER ANNE
                         The Body of Christ! 

                                     STAN
                         Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to 
                         eat him, but he didn't want us to be 
                         cannibals, so he turned himself into 
                         crackers, and then told people to eat 
                         him.
 
                                     SISTER ANNE
                         No!

                                     STAN
                         No??

                                     BUTTERS
                         Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many 
                         crackers.
 
                                     SISTER ANNE
                         Look: all you have to know is that when 
                         the priest gives you the cracker, you 
                         eat it! Okay?!
 
                                     KENNY, STAN, CARTMAN
                         O-kay.

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         And then, you will drink a very small 
                         amount of wine, for that, is the Blood 
                         of Christ.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Aw, come on now, this is just getting 
                         silly! 
 
                                     SISTER ANNE
                         Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!

                                     CARTMAN
                          Nno!

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         Then stop questioning me.

                                     CARTMAN
                         But now we can have Communion and not 
                         go to hell, right?
 
                                     SISTER ANNE
                         No. Because before you can take your 
                         first Communion, you have to have your 
                         first Confeesion.

                                     SISTER ANNE
                         You'll be getting in the Confession 
                         box with a priest and confessing all 
                         your sins, so that God can forgive you. 
                         You kids will all have to go to your 
                         first Confession this Tuesday, so I 
                         want you all to go home tonight and 
                         think long and hard about all your sins, 
                         so that you can tell the priest everything.

                         part of me that will always love him, 
                         I... But I also know how abusive he wasI'm 
                         much happier with you.

                         is fucking crazy.

                         thing going. But I think that's what 
                         you were attracted to. But I can be 
                         a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!

                         We're trying to remember all our sins. 
                         Sister Anne told us we have to confess 
                         all our sins or else we're gonna go 
                         to hell.

                         deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my 
                         life is so much better now with Chris. 
                          Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect 
                         in every way, but there's just something 
                         about Saddam that I'm more more attracted 
                         to.  In what way?  Yeah, you're right. 
                         Saddam would just treat me bad again. 
                         I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. 
                         Put him out of my mind and focus on 
                         Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I 
                         won't have such strong feelings for 
                         him. Thanks guys.

                         eating.

                         forgive you if he knew.

                         the sandwich that the priest was eating, 
                         took the piece of ham out of it, put 
                         it between my butt cheeks, and then 
                         put the sandwich back and watched him 
                         eat it.

                         pee-pee in the holy water thing, and 
                         the priest blessed himself on the forehead 
                         with it every day for about a week. 
                          And then this one time, I was at the 
                         park, and the priest was out walking 
                         his dog and I went-... number two on the 
                         sidewalk and then told officer Barbrady 
                         that it was the priest's dog.  And so 
                         the priest got find like a hundred dollars 
                         for not cleaning it up. And then this 
                         one time, I put super glue all over 
                         the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! 
                         Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  
                         Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me 
                         out of here!
