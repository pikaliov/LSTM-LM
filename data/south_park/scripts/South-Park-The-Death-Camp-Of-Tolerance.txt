                                     MR. GARRISON
                          You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
 
                         
                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr. 
                         Garrison, sometime ago you asked to 
                         be promoted from teachng kindergarten 
                         back to the third grade.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          I'm aware of that.

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         I wanna come clean with you and tell 
                         you that back then some of us were uncomfortable 
                         with your sexual preferences. It was 
                         wrong of us, and I want to make it up 
                         to you.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Wow, that's... really great to hear.
 
                         
                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         As you know, the position of Fourth 
                         Grade teacher has become available, 
                         and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
 
                         
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Oh, for real? You're not kidding?
 
                         
                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         We in administration see now that you 
                         are an individual with your own preferences, 
                         and we respect that.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Hoh, this is all just... this is a 
                         dream come true!  Thank you, Principal 
                         Victoria! I'll do a great jub!
 
                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         I know you will. 

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          You're sure this is for real? I mean, 
                         I'm not gonna just get fired again for 
                         being gay tomorrow.
 
                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                          It's for real, Mr. Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Oh-ho, great!

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         With all the new laws we could never 
                         fire you for being gay now. You'd be 
                         able to sue us for millions of dollars.
 
                         
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         Well, I was just saying that the policies 
                         have really changed. You know, we fire 
                         you for acting gay next time, you'd 
                         be able to sue the school district for 
                         ...lots of money.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         ...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... 
                         how much money, exactly?
 
                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                          Oh. Well, there was the case out in 
                         Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 
                         25 million, I think.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh, 
                         Principal Victoria.  Holy Moley! I've 
                         gotta find a way to get fired for being 
                         gay!

                         M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks 
                         have been really hard with the death 
                         of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik.

                         BUT... the principal has finally hired 
                         a teacher to take her place. So I want 
                         you all to give your best behavior to 
                         your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison.

                         whoare new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, I was informed that fourth graders 
                         are a little too old for Mr. Hat.

                         But it's okay because I found a new 
                         teacher's assistant. Say hello to... 
                          Mr. Slave.

                          Hi kids. Hm.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's 
                         assitant.  Or, as I like to write for 
                         short, the Teacher's Ass.
 
                                     MR. SLAVE
                          Oh Jesus Christ.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need 
                         you. 
 
                                     MR. SLAVE
                         Ugh.

                         by a...  Pakistani.

                         I'm not saying the rest of the school 
                         year will be easy. In fact, it's going 
                         to be long and hard.  Really long and 
                         really hard.

                         learning about is communist Russia.

                          Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         No, it was Kenny!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!

                                     STAN
                          Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, 
                         and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's 
                         body.

                         foolishness in my class! It's time for

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         I will  NOT put up with  TOMfoolery 
                         in my  CLASSroom, children.  Mr. Slave, 
                         put this rubber ball in your mouth. 
                          Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll 
                         get me fired for sure.

                         I really enjoyed the imagery in the 
                         last chapter of this month's book.

                         Yes, and I really saw the entire book 
                         thematically as a take on corporate 
                         America.

                         Well I think in the fourth chapter, 
                         when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody 
                         glove in the cheerleader's locker, well 
                         that uh that was just a brilliantly 
                         written passage.

                         Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant 
                         Mountain a little too easily?

                         These wax figures represent how some 
                         intolerant people have labled minorities. 
                          Here we see a black person eating chicken 
                         and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts 
                         the African-American community. What 
                         other stereotypes do you see here?

                         That's right. Not all stereotypes are 
                         negative. But even a positive one like 
                         "All Asians are good at math" is harmful 
                         to society.

                         get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're 
                         just gonna have to go on and learn more 
                         today.  Now who can tells me what happens 
                         to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen 
                         burner?

                         Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass 
                         tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also 
                         see how other things react.  Evaporation 
                         is an exothermic reaction, so let's 
                         look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, 
                         position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put 
                         the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight 
                         ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass

                         Garrison has this new assistant, and 
                         we're really uncomfortable around him.

                         Children, a lot of times the reason 
                         get uncomfortable around gay people 
                         is that they have some issues themselves. 
                         You have to ask yourself, "What is it 
                         about their behavior that, for some 
                         reason, makes me unconfortable?"

               To find his way out of a gay man's ass.

               The road ahead is filled with danger and fright

               But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might.

                         of the small intestine. Now you must 
                         seek out the Sparrow Prince.

               Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.

               Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late

               Slow down now and seal your fate.

                                     SPARROW PRINCE
                         I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my 
                         spirit been trapped within this place. 
                         Before you lies the maze of the small 
                         intestine. One path leads to the stomach, 
                         the other to certain doom. Take with 
                         you this helmet and torch.  Let them 
                         be your guide.

                         you light the way.
 
               There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.
 
               
               Ahead you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.
 
               
               Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win.

               [Outside Mr. Slave's stomach, onstage]

                                     MR. SLAVE
                         Oh! I should have never shoved all those 
                         poor animals up my ass! 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Uh...

                                     MAN 4
                          Courageous.

                                     MAN 5
                          So courageous.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          God-damnit, don't you people get it?! 
                         I'm trying to get fired here! 
 
                                     MAN 3
                          Oh, that's courageous.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Look, this kind of behavior should not 
                         be acceptable from a teacher!
 
                                     MR. SLAVE
                         Yeah, Jesus Christ.

                                     MAN 6
                         But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant
 
                         
                                     MAN 3
                          Yes. The mu-se-um.

                                     MAN 7
                          The mu-se-um tells us.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just 
                         because you have to tolerate something 
                         doesn't mean you have to approve of 
                         it! If you had to like it, it'd be called 
                         the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate" 
                         means you're just putting up with it! 
                         You tolerate a crying child sitting 
                         next to you on the airplane or, or you 
                         tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss 
                         you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!

                         He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, 
                         they just hated the way this asshole 
                         was acting.

                         We'ge gotta get our boys back! 

                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get 
                         fired and get my 25 million dollars?!

                         No, no, I think I have a better idea.
 
                         
               [Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, Saturday, day. The boys' parents 
               are at the front gate. Black-and-white fades into color, and 
               Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters are present. They are quite thin, 
               clearly undernourished, and their clothes fit loose on them]
 
               
                                     RANDY
                         We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell 
                         us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?

                         Yes. You boys don't know how much we 
                         suffered.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well this is insane!

                                     PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                         I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious 
                         you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.

                         I assure you, the next veek will be 
                         nothing but pain and suffering! 
 
                                     MR. SLAVE
                         Oooo, this could be kind of fun.
