               [Unplanned Parenthood, day. It has undergone renovation, so it 
               looks softer. It's snowing outside]
 
               [Inside, operating room. A woman is waiting on a hospital bed. 
               She's quite pregnant. A doctor enters the room with a cart housing 
               everything he needs for his work, and approaches the bed]
 
                                     DOCTOR
                         Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for 
                         your abortion? 
 
                                     MS. SANDERS
                         Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess. 
                         
 
                                     DOCTOR
                         Well, try to relax; It will all be over 
                         very soon. 
 
                                     MS. SANDERS
                         Docter, can we turn off that television? 
                         
 
                                     DOCTOR
                          Oh yes, I 'm sorry.

               Now, there is one more thing.

                                     MS. SANDERS
                         What?

                                     DOCTOR
                         Have you heard of stem-cell research?
 
                         
                                     MS. SANDERS
                         Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... 
                         I don't know what it is.
 
                                     DOCTOR
                         Well basically, a lot of amazing studies 
                         have shown that stem cells might be 
                         used to fight cancer and a myriad of 
                         other diseases. Right now, a lot of 
                         stem cells come from the tissue of aborted 
                         fetuses-  ah I'm sorry, unwanted children. 
                         And if you sign a release, that tissue 
                         can go to studies
 
                                     MS. SANDERS
                         Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.
 
                         
                                     DOCTOR
                         The hope is that someday it might. 
 
                         
                                     MS. SANDERS
                         Well okay. 

                                     DOCTOR
                         Great.  Well, here we go. 

               [Hallway outside operating room. The sounds of abortion are heard, 
               but the operation itself isn't seen. A janitor passes by with 
               a vacuuum cleaner. The OR door opens and the doctor steps out 
               with a small container]
 
                                     DOCTOR
                         Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs 
                         for stem-cell research.

                         They're cells that come from fetuses, 
                         and some research show that they could 
                         be used to treat diseases.

                         3-2-1 Contact. With all the research 
                         that's going on, stem cells are worth 
                         three times their weight in gold. What 
                         I have in my back yard is an aborted 
                         treasure chest.

                         cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in 
                         possession of somesah aborted fetuses 
                         that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how 
                         much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, 
                         ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty 
                         dollars a pound right now. ...How about 
                         a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my 
                         balls- I, I'll think about it.

               Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem 
               cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've 
               been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, 
               Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company 
               give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here.

               Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses 
               for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, 
               I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. 
               I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna 
               talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? 
               Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
 
               [later]

               I gotta unload these fetuses, you wannan do some research. Are 
               we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling 
               you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal 
               mistake. [suddenly grins and covers the receiver with his right 
               hand] That's a joke [removes his hand from the receiver] ...A 
               hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.

                                     LARRY
                          This is where the bulk of our research 
                         was being done. But due to the government 
                         ban, we're mostly just packing things 
                         up.

                         Doctor, can you tell me exactly how 
                         stem cells work?
 
                                     LARRY
                         Look, you have trillions of cells in 
                         your body: heart cells, skin cells, 
                         brain cells, and so on. But before a 
                         cell is designated as a toenail cell 
                         or a pancreas cell, it's what we call 
                         a stem cell. Sort of like a black cell. 
                         Do you understand?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Not at all, but go on.

                         Because these cells are blanks, they 
                         will often program themselves based 
                         on what cells you put around them. You 
                         see this rat? Earlier this year, we 
                         surgically removed the middle of her 
                         spine. then we injected her with some 
                         stem cells and... they became the mising 
                         part of the spine.

                         My God...

                         Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease 
                         or heart tissue of cardiac patients 
                         might ultimately be replaced by tissue 
                         grown from stem cells.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         So then, could stem cells be used on 
                         someone whose muscle tissue is wasting 
                         away? Ihin other words, if a little 
                         boy was dying from a muscular disease, 
                         the stem cells could become new muscle 
                         tissue.

                         That's the theory.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, so then, if the stem cells are 
                         placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they 
                         would become another Shakey's Pizza! 
                         And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza 
                         where you didn't have to charge yourself 
                         to eat!

                         Well, no. To build another Shake's it 
                         would be better to use lumber.

                         But, unfortunately, the government has 
                         banned stem cell research and so...

                         and that now she suddenly speaks with 
                         a British accent and she thinks she 
                         can play guitar and she should go fuck

                          Stan, sometimes God takes those closest 
                         to us, because it makes him feel better 
                         about himself. He is a very vengeful 
                         God, Stan. He's all pissed off about 
                         something we did thousands of years 
                         ago. He just can't get over it, so he 
                         doesn't care who he takes.Children, 
                         puppies, it don't matter to him, so 
                         long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         But then, why does God give us anything 
                         to start with?
 
                                     CHEF
                         Well, look at it this way: if you want 
                         to make a baby cry, first you give it 
                         a lollipop. Then you take it away. If 
                         you never give it a lollipop to begin 
                         with, then it would have nothin' to 
                         cry about. That's like God, who gives 
                         us life and love and help just so that 
                         he can tear it all away and make us 
                         cry, so he can drink the sweet milk 
                         of our tears. You see, it's our tears, 
                         Stan, that give God his great power.

                         My name is Eric Cartman and I live in 
                         Colorado. My best friend in the whole 
                         world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's 
                         sick right now. He's real sick. He's 
                         only eight years old and his doctors 
                         don't think he has very long to live. 
                         Look, I realize that using the tissue 
                         from aborted fetuses for research is 
                         a touchy subject, but... All I know 
                         is that if there's a chance, a... chance 
                         that stem-cell research could save my 
                         best friend's life, well... I guess 
                         I owe it to him to try and change your 
                         minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and... 
                          I want you to love him too.  And I 
                         uh, I'm not the best speaker in the 
                         world. Maybe I can put it best in the 
                         words of a timeless song

                                     KYLE
                         I actually hugged you. I held you in 
                         my arms and, and, cried with you.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         I think I only need a hundred or so 
                         more aborted babies,  and I can finish 
                         up the kitchen.
 
                                     KYLE
                         AAARGH! 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 

                                     STAN
                         Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend! 
                          Cartman was! 
 
               THE END
