               witha small volcano - his science experiment.]

                         ...And so, just like in nature, ah I 
                         can add the mixture into the volcano 
                         and... 
 
               O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-

               [the belching volcano draws his attention as it coughs up the 
               "lava"] Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.

                         Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.

                         Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got 
                         a check. That's like a C!

                         Okay. Whose project should we look at 
                         next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?

                         Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, 
                         I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In 
                         this way we see the duality of writing 
                         devices that occur in nature.

                         now! I'm giving you a check minus.

                         Using my laptop computer, I hooked into 
                         the Internet and found a meteorology 
                         Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and 
                         with my dad's video projector, I can 
                         show you the graph I made of predictable 
                         weather patterns over the next three 
                         months.

                         No! No, see, this is the fundamental 
                         flaw with the check check-plus check-minus 
                         system! The only reason Token was able 
                         to do all that is because his family 
                         is rich!

                         a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so!

                         have their own pool table.
