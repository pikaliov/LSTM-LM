                          And so, in her career filled with lies, 
                         backstabbing, and whoring herself for 
                         money,  she learned that the price of 
                         fame can be pleasing 65 men at once 
                         in a dark, dirty alley.  And so ends

                         in the small Canadian village of Toronto. 
                          At a very early age his parents noticed 
                         an uncanny musical ability and decided 
                         to enroll him in the Canadian School 
                         for gifted babies.  It was here that 
                         he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle 
                         , a brash young baby from Montreal. 
                          Together, they performed musical acts 
                         that stunned Canadians everywhere.  
                         At the tender age of six, Terrance and 
                         Phillip were off to the United States 
                         to perform on the Ed Sullivan show . 
                         where American audiences would be exposed 
                         to Canadians for the first time.

                         The Canadian act confused American audiences. 
                          But then something happened that would 
                         change Terrance and Phillip's act forever. 
                          It was the birth of Canadian comedy. 
                          Terrance and Phillip spent the next 
                         several years perfecting their art, 
                         and meetng some of America's most infuential

                          As they entered their late teens, Terrance 
                         and Phillip were already starting to 
                         taste the sweet milk of success.  But 
                         the price of fame was looming, as Terrance 
                         and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. 
                          The '70s and '80s were a good time 
                         for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their 
                         act on the Donny and Marie Show earned 
                         them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were 
                         oin the cover of every magazine.  And 
                         then in 1998, even a saturday morning 
                         cartoon was made, based on Terrance 
                         and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves 
                         supplied the voices.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The cartoon was such a huge success 
                         that it started to breed confusion over 
                         whether Terrance and Phillip were animated 
                         characters or real people. And so, in 
                         1998,  the comedy team started work 
                         on what they thought would be their 
                         greatest achievement: A made-for-TV 
                         movie written by and starring Terrance 
                         and Phillip, called "Not Without My 
                         Anus."  It was their biggest project 
                         to date. But it had the misfortune of 
                         being scheduled on a night when a different 
                         and more pupolar show, the John Schneider 
                         Variety Hour , was supposed to air. 
                         When fans tuned in to see John Schneider 
                         and instead were treated to the Canadian 
                         made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, 
                         bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted 
                         and burned down the network, killing 
                         six television producers and wounding 
                         twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance 
                         and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell 
                         into a deep depression and started abusing 
                         wod pulp  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old 
                         fan and was sued for six million dollars. 
                         It was the first time the duo tasted 
                         failure , and it nearly killed them 
                         both.

                          After years of depression and suicide 
                         attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally 
                         decided to get together  for one last 
                         film:  the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. 
                         It was one of the highest-grossing films 
                         of the summer.  And though the film 
                         also started the Canadian-American War 
                         of 1999 , in which eight million people 
                         lost their lives, the film was conisdered 
                         a great success.  After almost being 
                         executed by the Aemrican government 
                         , Terrance and Phillip were eventually 
                         returned to Canada , where they were 
                         touted as heroes.  They have been to 
                         hell and back, through the very best 
                         and the very worst of times, together, 
                         but they had seen it through.  And so

                          Look, Kenny, everything turned out 
                         okay!
 
                                     KENNY
                         (Oh, well now that's sweet.)

                         Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted?

                         He sure did, Phillip.

                                     PHILLIP
                         NO, I'm asking you his name!

                         And so, Terrance and Phillip got back 
                         together, proving once and for all that 
                         fame and fortune are never as important 
                         as friendship.
