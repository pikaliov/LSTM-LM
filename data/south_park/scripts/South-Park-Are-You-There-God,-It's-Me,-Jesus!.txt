                         comes a time in every child's life when 
                         they grow up and nature takes its course 
                         by having you bleed out your ass for 
                         a few days every month.

                         Well, it's when puberty hits and you 
                         bleed, you know, down there.

                         to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. 
                         I have to hang out with the older crowd 
                         because now, I'm ma-ture.  I got my 
                         period, and you guys didn't. I got my 
                         period, and you guys didn't.

                         I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding 
                         out my ass.

                         In local news, a stomach virus is going 
                         around that is causing bleeding of the 
                         colon in some small children. Doctors 
                         are telling parents that the virus is 
                         nothing to worry about and that the 
                         infections can be dealt with with simple 
                         antibiotics.  Well, it's just four days 
                         until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new 
                         millennium is almost upon us, and all 
                         over the world people have started to 
                         celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing 
                         one another.  But probably the biggest 
                         event of the millennium is one happening 
                         in South Park, Colorado, where people 
                         have gathered for a chance to see Jesus 
                         Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by.

                         Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days 
                         until the new millennium, and hundreds 
                         if not thousands of people have come 
                         from all over the world seeking Jesus, 
                         here at his house in South Park.  Everyone 
                         is giddy with anticipation for Jesus 
                         to come out, because as we all know, 
                         if Jesus comes out of his house and 
                         is not scared by his shadow, it means 
                         the next thousand years will be full 
                         of peace and love.  Oh, it looks like 
                         Jesus might be coming out!

                         like the little fellow's a bit nervous. 
                          But he has taken another step out, 
                         Tom! This is great new for us!

                         Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You 
                         got your period, so now you're a man. 
                         We can hang out together on New Year's 
                         eve.  But first you need to buy some 
                         Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your 
                         pants so you don't get blood on your 
                         underwear.

                         was going to come out of his house, 
                         but then he went back inside. But meanwhile,

                         to show their support for Jesus.

                         So this is the first meeting of our 
                         club for teens who have gotten their 
                         periods. We're supposed to talk about 
                         our periods. And boys. Let's talk about 
                         boys first. I think Craig is pretty 
                         cool, but I don't think Clyde is very 
                         cool.

                         I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig 
                         is definitely cooler than Clyde.

                         (Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand 
                         times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't 
                         really seem to be a doubt.)

                         about our periods. Kyle, you first.

                         might clear things up for you.

                         shouldn't be bummed becuase everybody 
                         has their period at a different time.

                         then by God, I'm not gonna sit around 
                         and be the only periodless 8-year old

                         I wanted?
 
                                     JESUS
                         Well, God can't just answer every prayer 
                         and suddenly give you everything you 
                         want. That takes all the living out 
                         of life.

                                     JESUS
                         If God answered all our prayers, there'd 
                         be nothing left for us to do ourselves. 
                         Life is about problems, and overcoming 
                         those problems.  A-and growing and learning 
                         from obstacles. If God just fixed everything 
                         for us, then there'd be no point in 
                         our existence.  That's why he wouldn't 
                         show up to my New Year's party.

                         all this on my own.  I was overcome

                         the meaning of life?" or "Why are we

                          My child, you are a boy. Boys do not 
                         get periods. That's only for girls.

                         bit out of their asses because of an 
                         acute colon infection. And your friend 
                         Kyle simply lied about it.

                         You will hit puberty when the time is 
                         right. But you will never have a period, 
                         because you are a man  with titties. 
                         Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return 
                         to heaven.

                         why God wasn't answering me before!

                         okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate
