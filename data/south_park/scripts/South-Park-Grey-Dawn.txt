               Maxi as he delivers a service.]

                         Friends, we gather in this place to 
                         mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: 
                         nine good people who were run over in 
                         the street by an elderly woman driver.

                         boring.

                          You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine 
                         people died!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies.

                         It is sometimes hard, in times like 
                         these, to understand God's way. Why 
                         would he allow nine innocent people 
                         to be run down in the prime of their 
                         lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, 
                         shouldn't be driving? It is then that 
                         we must understand, God's sense of humor 
                         is very different from our own. He does 
                         not laugh at the simple "man walks into 
                         a bar" joke. No, God needs complex irony 
                         and subtle farcical twists that seem 
                         macabre to you and me. All that we can 
                         hope for is that God got his good laugh 
                         and a tragedy such as this will never 
                         happen again.

                         Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens 
                         have to be dealt with very gingerly,

                         away.

                         Another death tonight by a senior citizen 
                         motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction 
                         was killed instantly when struck by 
                         a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, 
                         who were trying to find Country Kitchen 
                         Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only 
                         two days after the accident in Deer 
                         Creek, where three construction workers 
                         and a bulldozer  were run down by senior 
                         citizen Paul Thom , who was trying to 
                         find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public 
                         outcry is forcing the DMV to consider 
                         suspending the licenses of all seniors 
                         over seventy, though no decision has 
                         yet to be made.

                         All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance 
                         on the town. The old people have blockades 
                         here  and here . The old ladies are 
                         keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, 
                         and the leaders along with my grandpa 
                         are most likely in the Mayor's office.

                         No. But we can sneak into town and shut 
                         down their food supply.  Here.

                         Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, 
                         and old people won't know what to do.

                         Springs. And all the old people died

                         have to do it tonight.  We'll start 
                         by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised 
                         as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and 
                         Kyle split off and set a diversion on 
                         the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan 
                         and I sneak into the Mayor's office 
                          and steal some of the explosives the 
                         old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: 
                         we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen 
                         Buffet, where we strap the explosives 
                         and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say 
                         our triple goodbye to Kyle, and them 
                         we send him inside.

                         Buffet and lock it from the inside so 
                         the seniors can't get in.

                         Well, I think this has been a real learning 
                         experience for the Marsh family. People 
                         died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just 
                         go home.

               THE END
