               [South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. But this 
               day, a substitute teacher enters with a bag of stuff and makes 
               an announcement.]
 
                                     SUBSTITUTE
                         Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison 
                         is away today. I am your substitute 
                         teacher, Mr. Wyland.

                                     MR. WYLAND
                         Now, I understand that some students 
                         in this class like to mess with substitute 
                         teachers.  But if we all behave and 
                         respect each other, I'm sure we can 
                         make this a fun and productive day. 
                         Let's start with roll call. Let's see, 
                         mmmmm.  Eric Cartman?

                         Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?

                         Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're 
                         laughin' so hard that the milk comes 
                         out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!

                         You have to be drinking milk for that 
                         to happen.

                         Not with me, man.

                                     MR. WYLAND
                         Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll 
                         call? Here's what we're gonna do today. 
                          I've been told that one of your classmates 
                         has been ill for several days Â— Kyle 
                         Broflovski?

                                     MR. WYLAND
                         Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's 
                         absence, our activity for the day is 
                         to make a get-well card for Kyle. So 
                         I got this large piece of poster board, 
                         and we're all gonna come up and use 
                         glitter.and glue to decorate it.

                                     MR. WYLAND
                         Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well 
                         card, too.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         But I don't want Kyle to get well. I 
                         hate Kyle.
 
                                     MR. WYLAND
                         I don't care! Get down here and do it!

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Mr. Garrison, after very careful review 
                         the school board believes that you should 
                         take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.

                         What??

                                     BOARD MEMBER
                         Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat 
                         disconcerting. 
 
                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Did you know that not one of your students 
                         knew who Sam Adams was?
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well, who cares about a guy that makes 
                         beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach 
                         history!

                         ...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even 
                         your educational record that we're most 
                         concerned about.  It's your somewhat 
                         substantial police record.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON

                         Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of 
                         attempting to solicit sex from a minor 
                         wa-
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! 
 
                         
                                     BOARD MEMBER
                         All we're saying is, perhaps you should 
                         take a little hiatus from teaching until 
                         this little  "child molestation" thing 
                         dies down a bit.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. 
                         It is the air that I breathe.
 
                                     CHAIRMAN
                         We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no 
                         choice.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher 
                         anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting 
                         my badge and gun... 
 
                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry 
                         a gun!
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?

                         this as a chance to do something you've

               Chapter 18

               Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an 
               erotic thought she often fantasized about.
 
               Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!

               And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help 
               but feel aroused.
 
               "Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly 
               and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt 
               good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to 
               the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was 
               surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all 
               around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood 
               forest of penises.

                         don't know if the Harequin Romance label

                         besides, we're not actually Native Americans.

                         man. Miss Information said that.

                         from Mexicans.

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Yes, of course, but we don't have a 
                         kidney donor!
 
                                     STAN
                         That's alright. If you'll all help, 
                         I think I have a plan.

                         back right now, or there's gonna be

                         Thank you. And you'd better hope to 
                         God it still works, just like it did

                         let your friend Kyle have it?

                         No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, 
                         it belongs to me! It's MINE!

                         for surgery.  If you'll just sign this

                         kidney blocker, and then we put catchup 
                         on your bed so you'd think we took your
