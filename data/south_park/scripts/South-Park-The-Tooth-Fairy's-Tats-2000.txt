               She lowers it as Cartman screams]

                         Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something 
                         wonderful has happened!

                         Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a 
                         tooth under my pillow, and she gave 
                         me two dollars!  She's only given me 
                         a lousy quarter before!
 
                                     LIANE
                         Oh my! She must think that you are a 
                         very special little muffin.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Yeah! This is so tits!

                         Don't say "tits," Eric.

                         Oh, I mean, this is so cool!

                         Well, then, now you should take that 
                         money and open up a savings account 
                         that has compounded daily interest.

                         Heh, you can compound daily my ass with 
                         interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy 
                         store and buy me a skateboard! 
 
                                     LIANE
                         But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy 
                         wants you to use that money to learn 
                         about saving.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy 
                         wants me to do with this money, okay? 
                         You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see 
                         you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!

                         Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only 
                         got a quarter.

                         Well, that doesn't matter, because I 
                         have an idea that is totally tits.

                         being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot 
                         for me. I don't know, but if we all 
                         chip in with teeth, then I can hide 
                         them under my pillow and we could get 
                         enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.

                         a  Sega Dreamcast?

                         Kenny: because your family is poor, 
                         and therefore has bad oral hygiene, 
                         so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, 
                         anyway. If you think about it, you should 
                         actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank 
                         you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.

                         Fellow dentists: As you all know, we 
                         are still having numerous reports of 
                         missing teeth from all over the country. 
                         There are also reports of missing tooth 
                         fairy money. We believe that there can 
                         be only one logical reason for all of 
                         this.  A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel 
                          that steals either teeth or money from 
                         children as they sleep in order to build 
                         some kind of giant nest  for its genetically 
                         superior and potentially dangerous offspring! 
                         We believe also that this creature would 
                         have at least a mild understanding of 
                         algebra , and that it-

                         I think what we've got here is some 
                         kind of black-market tooth racket. Something 
                         where one group is stealing the money 
                         and teeth from another group for a profit. 
                         
 
                                     DR. ROBERTS
                         Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous 
                         that sounds.
 
                                     MR. FOLEY
                         It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. 
                         I've seen it happen before.

                          Look, I know how to handle this. All 
                         we have to do is bring down the kingpin 
                         and the rest will fall. You'll see! 
                         I'll have it taken care of in a matter 
                         of weeks!

                         go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, 
                         we'll deal with the real problems at

                          Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel 
                         would most likely be about three to 
                         four-and-a-half feet tall. His large 
                         beak is probably detachable, and works 
                         as a flotation device.

                         Light is a wave unless it's observed? 
                         That means all matter is just a wave. 
                          Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh 
                         God, it's happening!

                         Did you bastards really think you could 
                         hide from me forever? Kolovski , put

                         Aw, drat! 

                                     MR. FOLEY
                         Give it up, kids. You're surrounded 
                         by dentists.
 
                                     LOOGIE
                         It was a trap!

                                     MR. FOLEY
                         That's right. And now it's all exposed! 
                         You're through! The only thing left 
                         to do is to haul all you kids down to 
                         prison!

                         What the hell?

                         I am nothing, and everything.

                         Well, I told you! 

                                     MR. FOLEY
                         Let's get outta here! 

                                     KYLE
                         Hunh. That was pretty weird.

                         Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup 
                         all along!  How could I be so stupid?!
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         What?

                                     LOOGIE
                         I can't believe I fell for such an obvious 
                         trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN

                         dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They 
                         lie. Lie right to your face.
 
                                     LOOGIE
                         Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has 
                         fallen.
 
                                     STAN
                         Really?

                                     LOOGIE
                         Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the 
                         flag football team this year anyways.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
 
                         
                                     LOOGIE
                         Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole 
                         thing's over with.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. But you know, I've learned something 
                         today. You see, the basis of all reasoning 
                         is the mind's awareness of itself. What 
                         we think, the external objects we perceive, 
                         are all like actors that come on and 
                         off stage. But our conscioousness, the 
                         stage itself, is always present to us.

               [The Platte River, day. Kenny has turned to his left. As the 
               end credits roll, Kenny tries with great effort to make his way 
               to a bank. He hops a few times and lands in a hidden gully in 
               which he promptly drowns. A motorized chair is soon heard]
