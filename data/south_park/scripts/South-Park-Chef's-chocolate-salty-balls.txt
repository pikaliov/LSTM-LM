               [A small Western town. Bustling sounds are heard as the camera 
               slowly pans down. A crowd streams by in the background behind 
               a sports car and limo, and front and center are Robert Redford 
               and a woman]

                         Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival 
                         here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded.

                         Because. People from L.A. love to come 
                         to a quaint little mountain town for 
                         a few days, and this gives them an excuse.

                         No, this used to be a quaint little 
                         mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi 
                         restaurants, upscale clothes stores, 
                         $25 parking, Liam Neeson I tell you, 
                         Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's 
                         resource out. We must move this festival 
                         to another small mountain town and begin 
                         again.

                         That's not a bad idea. But where?

                         Okay, children. I have some very exciting 
                         news for you Oo-why don't you tell 
                         them, Mr. Twig?

                         That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First 
                         Annual South Park Film Festival begins

                         Nono, Kyle. These are independent films.

                         No, dude, independent films are those 
                         black and white hippie movies. They're 
                         always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
 
                         
                                     WENDY
                         No they're not! Independent films are 
                         produced outside the Hollywood system. 
                         They're movies about all the glitz and 
                         glamour of Hollywood.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent 
                         film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating 
                         pudding!

                         more time, I'm sending you to the principal's

                         Anyway, children, I want you all to 
                         see at least one independent film at 
                         the festival and then write a paper 
                         about it.  The first film showing is 
                         called Witness To Denial, and it's a 
                         sexual exploration piece about two women 
                         in love.

                         where citizens from Los Angeles are 
                         arriving in droves for the town's first 
                         annual film festival. This is just a 
                         small quiet mountain community where 
                         nothing out of the ordinary ever really 
                         happens,  except for the occasional 
                         complete destruction of the entire town 
                          and so the excitement level is naturally 
                         very high. Right now, the townspeople 
                         are anxiously awaiting the arrival of 
                         some of Hollywood's top celebrities.

                         until we have used it up. And then move

                         Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to 
                         announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood 
                         Planet South Park, that the festival 
                         will be back next year!  And the year 
                         after that, and the year after that, 
                         and so on! And now, release the curtain! 
                          I give you, "Hollywood in South Park!"

                         Behold! Mr. Hankey!

                         Hoooooowwwdy-ho! 

                                     ROBERT
                         Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will 
                         be the official meeting place for all-
 
                         
                                     MR. HANKEY
                         Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy 
                         Kyle was right. There's not enough room 
                         in South Park to accomodate a festival.

                         Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't 
                         hear our chairman. If you could just 
                         turn yourself down. You're at about 
                         7 right now, we need you at about, 3, 
                         okay? 
 
                                     MR. HANKEY
                         Uh, folks, please. Little towns like 
                         this simply aren't made for friggin' 
                         films. We love havin' visitors, but 
                         golly, too many of you is hurtin' our 
                         ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals 
                         shouldn't be about what celebritites 
                         are comin' or what film is gonna get 
                         sold. It should be about people gettin' 
                         together, and watchin' movies, and about 
                         people who could never get their movies 
                         seen havin' a chance to have it watched, 
                         if only once. A good film festival should 
                         be something where we all say, "Gaw, 
                         let's forget about lawyers and managers 
                         and studios and celebrities. Let's forget 
                         all those things for just a while, and 
                         just watch some new art." 
 
                                     ROBERT

                         a few independent films are great, most 
                         of them suck ass.

                         Yes. And I've learned something, too. 
                          Being a sellout is sweet. Because you 
                         make a lot of money. And when you have 
                         money, you don't have to hang out with 
                         any poor-ass losers- like you guys. 
                         Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
