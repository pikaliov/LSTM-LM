                         These commercials are all so God-damned 
                         stupid!

                         Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial 
                         break gonna be??

                         What if they don't show the Terrance 
                         & Phillip trailer at all? What if we 
                         went through all of this for nothing?

                         You guys, calm down. This is what TV 
                         shows always do. They make the last 
                         commercial break the longest.

                         to name just a few. But I sure am glad 
                         we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you??
