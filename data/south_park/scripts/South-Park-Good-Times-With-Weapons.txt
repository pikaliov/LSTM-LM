               [Park County Fair, day. South Park is more spread out these days. 
               Looking like a small city now. People mill around. The boys walk 
               along a fairway. Cartman pulls out a small firecracker and tosses 
               it on the ground before Kyle and cackles softly]

                          Stop it, Cartman!

                         Pfaha, so funny.

                         Come on and take a look, folks. We've 
                         got a lot of knives for sale here.

                         Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and 
                         then we'll be like ninjas.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah. We won't have to take crap from 
                         anybody.

                         at the stupid fair all day long. They'll 
                         never know what we bought.  I'll get 
                         the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look 
                         Kenny! There's something even you can 
                         afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar 
                         ninety nine.

                         Okay, uh, you need to have your parents 
                         here when you buy them, though. I, I 
                         can't sell to anyone under eighteen

                         Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live 
                         his life out in solitude.  And it's 
                         because of times like these I was forced 
                         to a life of evil.  Society cast me 
                         out, and so I vowed to make them all 
                         pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows 
                         that beneath this sweet eight-year-old 
                         little boy lies the most evil, the most 
                         destructive supervillain of all time! 
                          Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you 
                         like dealing with me, ninjas!

                         that pie over there to the Thomsons. 
                         I made it to thank them for babysitting 
                         you last week.

                          In our last episode the four ninjas 
                         did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer 
                         of destruction and doom. It was during 
                         that great battle that ninja master 
                         Kenny threw his star into Professor 
                         Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious 
                         trouble, because their parents might 
                         find out they had weapons if Professor 
                         Chaos told on them. While trying to 
                         get Professor Chaos some aid at the 
                         veterinarian's office, the four ninjas 
                         ran into Craig and his three friends. 
                         They challenged the four ninjas to fight, 
                         and the legendary battle of Tokutawa 
                         began. It was during this battle that 
                         Professor Chaos escaped , and so the 
                         four ninjas were forced to join forces 
                         with Craig and his friends to find Professor 
                         Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.

                         upset over what's happened.  But let's 
                         try to speak one at a time.
 
                                     MAN 1
                         Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked 
                         and appalled at what happened! I don't 
                         know if the parents are to blame or 
                         if it's the times we're living in, but 
                         something has to change!
 
                                     TOWNSFOLK
                          Yeah! I agree!

                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         This is the worst thing that's happened 
                         in this town!  The worst thing!
 
                                     MAN 2
                         Yeah! I mean, there were children watching 
                         that auction! And when that little eight-year-old 
                         boy walked up and flashed his... penis... 
                         it was an outrage! 
 
                                     STAN
                         What?

                                     CARTMAN
                         What?

                                     SKEETER
                         Not only that, the auction was televised 
                         on public access, so my little daughter 
                         watchin' at home saw the -penis! How 
                         am I suppsoed to explain that to her?!
 
                         
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         This is what happens when the moral 
                         fabric of society breaks down! 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                          You see the damage you've caused, Eric 
                         Cartman?! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction! 
                         
 
                                     KYLE
                         Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' 
                         eye out with weapons?
 
                                     STAN
                         Just run with it, dude.

                                     KYLE
                          Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh my fragile little 
                         eight-year-old mind didn't know how 
                         to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman 
                         should be punished!
 
                                     MAN
                         Yeah! 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey, fuck you, Kyle!

               [Park County Community Center, outside. The doors open and Stan, 
               Kyle, and Kenny exit onto the parking lot]
 
                                     KYLE
                         Heck, I c- I can't believe it.

                                     STAN
                         Hyeah. I guess parents don't give a 
                         crap about violence if there's sex things 
                         to worry about.
 
                                     KYLE
                          So I guess this means we get to keep 
                         our weapons.
 
                                     STAN
                          Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some 
                         more work to do.
 
                                     THE BOYS
                          Hya!

               THE END
