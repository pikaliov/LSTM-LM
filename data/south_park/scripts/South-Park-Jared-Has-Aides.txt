                         part of it. But the way that I lost 
                         so much weight was that I got aides.

                         years ago and I've been losing weight 
                         ever since. It's amazing how slim you

                         City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? 
                         Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese 
                         food, but then eat only a little tiny

                         That's my whole point. First we fatten 
                         him up, then we make the deal with City 
                         Wok, then take the weight back off.

                         He's right. If Butters is naturally 
                         skinny, he'll be able to take the weight 
                         off faster.

                         Tom, I'm standing out in front of the 
                         Mayor's office, where the big liar, 
                         Jared, is once again about to speak. 
                         Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his 
                         celebrity hero status, which was lost 
                         when he announced that it was AIDS, 
                         not sub sandwiches, that caused him 
                         to lose weight. Let's listen in.

                         didn't understand why you felt betrayed 
                         by the fact that my aides helped me 
                         to lose weight, but now I understand 
                         that it isn't fair that- I had aides 
                         and most of you don't. And so, with 
                         all the money I've made from commercials, 
                         I have decided to start the Aides for 
                         Everyone Foundation!

                         it looks like you ate, and I fed your 
                         cat.
