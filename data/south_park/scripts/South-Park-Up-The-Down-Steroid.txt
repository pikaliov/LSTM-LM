                          The Special Olympics? What's so special 
                         about them?

                         Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta 
                         get down to the training center and 
                         start working out. Word is we have a 
                         lot of ssstiff competition this year.

                         Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped 
                         people like this. I mean, making them 
                         compete against each other just for 
                         our amusement.

                         some ppppretty stiff competition this 
                         year.  All of the special athletes seem 
                         to be in tip-top condition, and I can't 
                         even get past seven ru-reps. Huhh oh 
                         well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p--p-pooped. 
                         I'll see you in the locker room.

                          Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training 
                         really hard, but I'm not improving fast 
                         enough, and the Special Olympics are 
                         a... week away.

                         Wellll, maybe I can- help you out. You 
                         know, there are shortcuts.

                         don't show up in our urine tests.

                          You just take one of these little blue 
                         babies  three times a day  and inject 
                         this directly into your bloodstream 
                          twice a day before meals.

                         How much would this cost me?

                                     NATHAN
                         Ahhh it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep 
                         vice off my back and secure shipments 
                         from overseas.

                          Well... then maybe I'll just use them 
                         a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance 
                         en...hancer.

               How I Will Spend My

               One Thousand Dollars

               By Eric Cartman

               [a knock is heard at his door] Enter! [the door opens and Kyle 
               enters, stand there for a while, closes the door, then walks 
               up to Cartman. A few moments of uneasy silence follows]
 
                                     KYLE
                         Cartman, I really, really have a problem 
                         with what you're doing. I object to 
                         it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
                         
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Go on, Kyle.

                                     KYLE
                         I know that I often have serious moral 
                         objections to the things that you do, 
                         but... this time I think you really 
                         need to reconsider, because if you do 
                         this, I believe you will go to hell. 
                         So I feel it is my responsibility, as 
                         your friend, to tell people what you're 
                         doing, and to put a stop to it!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, Kyle, I understand where you're 
                         coming from, and I appreciate you being 
                         so direct. Um, the thing is, you really 
                         have kind a warped view on morality 
                         because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you 
                         haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, 
                         The Passion but-
 
                                     KYLE
                         I didn't come here to talk about The 
                         Passion, Cartman!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion 
                         you would know that Hell is reserved 
                         for the Jews, and all those who don't 
                         accept Christ. That being the case, 
                         it is actually me who is worried about 
                         your soul.
 
                                     KYLE
                         I came here to talk about you!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes.  And instead you had to break through 
                         yourself. This is really the beginning 
                         of a whole new chapter of your life, 
                         Kyle.  Good luck.

               18.5 feet, skids a foot more, then stops and waits for the score]

                                     JIMMY

                         the bbub-best! 
 
                                     HOST
                         Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know 
                         that the Special Olympics isn't just 
                         about winning. And so, we will now give 
                         out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped 
                         person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Ah, screw you hippie!

                                     HOST
                         For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will 
                         receive this gift certificate to Shakey's 
                         for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         ...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  
                         Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
 
                                     JIMMY
                          Hey! Just what the hell do you think 
                         you're doing, Eric?!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.

                                     JIMMY
                         You ffffaked being handicapped to win?! 
                          I should k-kick your ass right here, 
                         you lousy no-good ch-ch-ch...cheater!
 
                         
                                     TIMMY
                          Timmih!

                                     JIMMY
                         What?

                                     TIMMY
                          Timmih!

                                     JIMMY
                          Oh my God. You, you're right, Timmy. 
                         You're totally right.  Everyone, can 
                         I have your attention, please?  I'm 
                         afraid I have to give back my medal. 
                         The truth is, I haven't been playing 
                         fair either. I've been using st-steroids. 
                         I was willing to do anything to be the 
                         best, and the steroids made me blind 
                         to the people I was hurting.  A good 
                         friend even tried to talk me out of 
                         it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking 
                         steroids is just like pretending to 
                         be handicapped at the Special Olympics. 
                          Because you're taking all the fairness 
                         out of the game. But I know now that 
                         even if you do win on steroids, you're 
                         really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. 
                         You're just a  big fat p-p...p...pussy, 
                         and if you take steroids, the only decent 
                         thing to do is come forward and say, 
                          "Remove me from the record books, because 
                         I am a big, stinky p-pussy-"  "-steroid-taking 
                         jackass."  That's how I feel about myself, 
                         and why I must decline this medal and 
                         my place in the history books. And if 
                         you'll let me, I'll be back next year. 
                         To compete with honor. 
 
                                     MCGUIRE
                         Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
 
                         
               [The stands. Cartman walks up to his friends]

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well guys, I guess now you see what 
                         I was up to all along. I dressed up 
                         like a handicapped person and lost the 
                         Special Olympics on purpose, so that 
                         Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. 
                          Eh, oh yeah?! Well, well you guys are 
                         assholes!  Grow up! 
 
               THE END
