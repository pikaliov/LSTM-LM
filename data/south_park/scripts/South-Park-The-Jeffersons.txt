                         Yeah, I think they already moved in. 
                         I saw moving vans in their driveway 
                         two days ago.

                         to move somewhere to get away from it 
                         all. He said he wanted piece and quiet, 
                         and to live with a bunch of hicks who 
                         don't know anything.

                         He was out all alone in the middle of 
                         the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even 
                         home.

                         your son home.
 
                                     MR. JEFFERSON
                         We can't go home. There's a ghost in 
                         our house. Me and Blanket are scared.

                         up, arrest him fast and try not to beat 
                         him. There could be neighbors with video 
                         cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?

                         framing wealthy African-Americans with 
                         crimes they didn't commit?
 
                                     HARRIS
                         Oh why? I guess I never thought about 
                         why, sir. We just do it.

                         Twenty-five years I've been on the force. 
                         I've seen every kind of sick, depraved 
                         act known to humanity and still, when 
                         I see a black man walk by who has more 
                         money than me, I... want to vomit my 
                         gizzards right in the gutter. But why? 
                         Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's 
                         just a big blue ball out there that's 
                         mostly covered with water and we're 
                         just goin' along for the ride.

                         know how I worry.

                         I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting 
                         the force. 
 
                                     MAGGIE
                         Quitting the force? You?

                                     YEATS
                         None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't 
                         even know if what we're doing is right. 
                         The last thirteen hours we've been working 
                         on a case, trying to get a real scumbag 
                         off the streets. And when he walked 
                         up to the door, I could have sworn he 
                         was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference 
                         anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because 
                         it seems like every time we frame a 
                         rich black guy, he's back out on the 
                         streets in no time. It's just like OJ. 
                         Do you know how hard those cops worked 
                         to frame him? The tireless hours they 
                         put in?? And then he just gets off because 
                         somebody messed up and said the N word 
                         out loud too many times. I guess I'm 
                         just tired. I'm jast damn tired.

                          Not another word of that kind of talk, 
                         Harrison Yeats.  Believe me I would 
                         love nothin' more than to have you quit 
                         the force and no longer have to worry 
                         about whether or not you're comin' home.

                         off their faces is the only thing that 
                         puts a smile on yours. You're a good

                         named Jefferson here. If we had, we 
                         would have framed him ourselves.

                         rich he made bail and disappeared before

                          Hang on, Blanket! 

                                     MR. JEFFERSON
                          Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!

                                     YEATS
                          Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You 
                         are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          No! I am sick and tired of people harassing 
                         Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing 
                         since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick 
                         lies! That he molests children, that 
                         he's a bad father, that he has plastic 
                         surgery!
 
                                     MR. JEFFERSON
                         It's ignorant. 

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little 
                         different. But that's because he had 
                         to work all the time when he was young 
                         and missed out on his childhood. What's 
                         wrong with wanting to have the innocence 
                         and beauty of a child.
 
                                     KYLE
                          All right, let's just say all the bad 
                         things said about Mr. Jefferson are 
                         lies! Let's say the police department 
                         does just go around spending their time 
                         framing people for crimes they didn't 
                         commit!  Let's say it's all made up, 
                         and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy 
                         who's trying to be a child because he 
                         never got to have a childhood. Well 
                         that's fine, except for that he HAS 
                         children now! And when people have children, 
                         they have to grow up!
 
                                     MR. JEFFERSON
                          You're right. I've been so obsessed 
                         with my childhood that I've forgotten 
                         about his. I thought having lots of 
                         rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket 
                         doesn't need a playmate. He needs a 
                         father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo 
                         gainuh.  Blanket, I wanna give away 
                         all my money. I I wanna get a normal 
                         job and... take a shot at raising you 
                         in a normal setting. 
 
                                     BLANKET
                         Look everybody! I'm a normal little 
                         boy.
 
                                     YEATS
                          Well, if you're gonna give away all 
                         your money, then, I guess we can drop 
                         all those charges. No point in putting 
                         another poor black man in jail.
 
                                     KYLE
                         All right! Things just might work out!
 
                         
                                     MR. JEFFERSON
                         Things can always work out, as long 
                         as we know we have the power to change. 
                         
 
               We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts
 
               
               And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays

               And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
 
               
               And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.

               Jejabee durtah!
