                         it was rough at work today. I've never

                         a bag came to the door. He just left 
                         this li'l piece of paper with a stamp

                          It's from a game show. The Mayor has 
                         invited me to compete.

                          I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned 
                         something today. You see, animal species 
                         come and go. It's all a part of natural 
                         evolution.

                         The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct 
                         if we hadn't interfered. Because their 
                         particular form of life simply wasn't 
                         practical.

                          We can't go around saving every form 
                         of life, any more than we can kill them 
                         all. We have to let nature run its course.
