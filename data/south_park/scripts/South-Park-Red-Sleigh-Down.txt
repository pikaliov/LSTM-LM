               [Cartman's house, day. In his room, Cartman has Kyle's cousin 
               Kyle tally up his good and bad deeds to see where he will end 
               up this year. Cousin Kyle is seated at Cartman's desk with piles 
               of paper to go through and an adding machine to keep it all current.]

                         Av-a-a-alright, I'm done.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You're done?

                         Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times 
                         you've been naughty and deducted the 
                         times you've been nice.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, so how's it look?

                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't 
                         look good.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         But I'll still be getting presents this 
                         year, right?
 
                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna 
                         owe Santa three hundred and six presents.

                         What?!

                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         Four thousand three hundred and twelve 
                         instances of being naughty against three 
                         deductions of being nice, is is, is 
                         bad.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice 
                         invoices! Look look! What about this 
                         one? 
 
                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde 
                         in the balls with slingshot" really 
                         counted as nice.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         It was nice for Token; he laughed for 
                         like 20 minutes.
 
                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         Ye you can't deduct things like that, 
                         Eric. Santa will know and then he'll 
                         come after you.

                          God-damnit I have to get that Haibo 
                         robot doll, you sonofabitch!
 
                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice 
                         accoutant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's 
                         like a pet, a robot pet. You have to 
                         feed it and pet it or else it dies, 
                         and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa 
                         has to bring me one!
 
                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         But what, look, aren't there any other 
                         nice things you've done recently we 
                         can write off here?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
 
                         
                                     COUSIN KYLE
                         Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty 
                         or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more 
                         into the category of... brushing your 
                         teeth.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Well there's still time before Christmas! 
                         Can't I still make up for it?

                         If you cure cancer... and AIDS next 
                         week, you would still owe two presents.

                         a way to do... the nicest, greaatest

                         Good evening, everyone. In a moment 
                         we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas 
                         Tree to kick off the holidays!

                         I'm just letting you know how special

                         But now, before we light the tree, I 
                         think we should all reflect for a moment 
                         on those who are less fortunate than 
                         us.  Right now in Iraq there are children 
                         who fear us and what we might do to 
                         their country. The threat of war touches 
                         us all, but over in Iraq, their is no 
                         Christmas. They have nothing.
