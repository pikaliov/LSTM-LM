               [Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are in the living room 
               playing video games.]

                         HA! I killed you!

                                     STAN
                         HA, I blew your head off!

                                     KENNY
                         (Aw, Goddamnit!)

                         Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! 
                         You giving birth in there, or what?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Let a man take a crap!

                         Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Hyeah, that poor, poor thing

                                     STAN
                         Come on, Cartman! You're missing the 
                         game!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm 
                         just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell 
                         is that?  You guys, look what I found 
                         in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. 
                         It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped 
                         in toilet paper.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Well, why did you pull it out of the 
                         trash?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, 
                         but look, check it out, it's all bloody.

                          Are you guys still playing that video 
                         game?
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah. Hay Mom, Cartman found a bloody 
                         cotton thing in the bathroom.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', 
                         I think it's just for lookin' through.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Why?

                                     SHARON
                         Just go put it back in the trashcan!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          Hey, it's like all bloody. It might 
                         be alive.
 
                                     SHARON
                         No that... that came from me; just put 
                         it away.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         This came out of you?? You just left 
                         it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta 
                         done that. He's just a boih. Poor little 
                         feller.

                          What is it, Mom?

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?

                                     SHARON
                         Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, 
                         it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell 
                         you what: If you'll just drop the whole 
                         thing right now, I'll buy you that new 
                         video game console you've been wanting.

                         Sure.

                         you guiys!

               hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window

                         I don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, 
                         dude, you're the luckiest kid in South 
                         Park.

                         Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one 
                         who found Stan's aborted brother in 
                         the trashcan and blackmailed his mom 
                         into getting the GameSphere. 
 
                                     STAN
                         Alright, alright, but you guys gotta 
                         see if you can sleep over for the rest 
                         of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 
                         - that means we have... 39 hours to 
                         play GameSphere until school on Monday!

                         What?

                         I'm supposed to go to the lake with 
                         my family tomorrow and swim and play 
                         in the stupid sun.

                         Dude, we got GameSphere.

                                     KYLE
                         I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay 
                         over anyway so I can play for... eighteen 
                         hours, and then I'll go to the lake.

                         Don't forget to bring a towel. 

                                     STAN
                         What?

                         When you get out of the water you need 
                         to dry off right away to avoid catchin' 
                         a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't 
                         forget to bring a towel."

                         Anyway, that will give me plenty of 
                         time playing video games.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama 
                         GameSphere.

                         as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, 
                         one day, Towelie got high and just sort 
                         of wandered off. Again.

                         return to Tynacorp, and we will launch 
                         a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well.

                         central core, and upload this encryption 
                         disk into their system, bringing them 
                         down once and for all.
