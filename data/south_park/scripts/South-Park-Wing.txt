               [South Park Elementary, day. Class is in session. The kids are 
               chattering when Mrs. Garrison gets their attention]
 
                                     MRS. GARRISON
                         Children, children, we have a very special 
                         announcement.  Your classmate, Token, 
                         has just returned from winning the Colorado 
                         Child Star Contest with his incredible 
                         singing! Well let's give him a hand! 
                         
 
                                     STAN
                         Token sings?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Of course he sings. He's black.

                                     MRS. GARRISON
                         Token is going to sing in front of a 
                         huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant 
                         in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna 
                         be paid two hundred dollars.
 
                                     CLASS
                         Whoa!

                                     STAN
                         Two hundred dollars.

                                     MRS. GARRISON
                         Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit 
                         against those chauvinistic pageants, 
                         but I hope that you children take a 
                         moment today to congratulate Token for 
                         being so special.
 
               [South Park Elementary, lunchtime. Stan and friends sit at a 
               table just outside the school kitchen. They're deep in thought]

                         You wanna know what it is, guys?

                         We're not talented?

                                     CARTMAN
                         That's right. We're not talented. See, 
                         we're not the artistic side, we're the 
                         thinking side.
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.

                          Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing 
                         idea. Token is going right to the top, 
                         right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge 
                         star.

                         Probably.

                                     CARTMAN
                         So, why shouldn't we get some of that 
                         money? We can be Token's agents. That 
                         way, we get ten percent of whatever 
                         he makes!
 
                                     STAN
                         Hey yeah! We deserve that money just 
                         as much as he does.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         We just need a really kickass office 
                         and some nice suits. A and a fountain 
                         in our lobby. All top agencies have 
                         fountains in their lobbies. We gotta 
                         make Token think he needs us, when actually 
                         he doesn't need us at all.

                         Cartman tries out his suit in front 
                         of a full-length mirror in his room. 
                         Stan and Kyle try out suits in Kyle's 
                         room. Next, the boys are in a department 
                         store purchasing cell phones at Bull's 
                         Eye. Next, Stan and Kyle carry an executive 
                         desk into the new office. Next, Cartman 
                         and Kenny steal a fountain from somebody's 
                         backyard. Next, flyers for the new agency, 
                         Super Awesome Talent Agency, are printed 
                         out. Next, the boys are at a copy center 
                         to get some business cards. Next, Cartman 
                         and Kyle set up signs around town. Next, 
                         the finished office is shown... in Cartman's 
                         basement. The four boys congratulate 
                         each other for a job well donw.]
 
               [South Park, day. Token walks by one of the signs the boys drew 
               up. He notices it and stops to read it. The boys hide around 
               the corner. Stan peaks around the corner.]

                         Perfect! All right, you guys get back 
                         to the office, I'll bring Token there.

                         Wait a minute! You guys, this is very 
                         important: when I bring Token back to 
                         the office, have Kenny hide in another 
                         room, and call the phone on my desk.

                         Because I'll answer and pretend I'm 
                         talking to somebody super famous and 
                         important. When Token sees that, maybe 
                         he'll think we're legit.

                         office, Token? Maybe I can convince 
                         the company to represent you.

                         to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why 
                         do I need an agency? Why should I give 
                         them ten percent?" Right?
