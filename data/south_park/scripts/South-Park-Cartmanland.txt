                         Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my 
                         park.  Look, I haven't been honest with 
                         you. The park hasn't been doing great 
                         business.

                         Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris.  The 
                         truth is, the park is a financial flop. 
                         I haven't turned a profit in years because 
                         I can't keep attendance up.

                         Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get 
                         people to come.

                                     CARTMAN
                         No no no! I'm buying it to keep people 
                         out!  Don't you see? Forever it has 
                         been my dream to have my very own theme 
                         park, so that I could be alone in it, 
                         all day, every day. I love theme parks. 
                          But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, 
                         crowds,  The rides are great, but... 
                          All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's 
                         one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, 
                         lines, LINES!!  And then there get to 
                         be so many people  that they make FastPass. 
                          So then there's lines for FastPass. 
                          You stand in line to get a ticket to 
                         stand in line later. Then there's lines 
                         for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks 
                         , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas 
                         Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park 
                         is for me. Nobody else will be allowed 
                         in it.

                         bad.

                          Do you know what happened to me this 
                         morning, Stan? This morning... I woke 
                         up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. 
                         I felt down there and, and found this... 
                         big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't 
                         even sit down, so... I, I had to tell 
                         my mother, which, which was humiliating. 
                         She took me to the doctor, which was 
                         more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. 
                         I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an 
                         infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm 
                         nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, 
                         Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman 
                         has his own theme park.

                         but-

                          Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all 
                         my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! 
                         To believe that we should all behave 
                         a certain way and good things will come 
                         tu us. I make mistakes, but every week 
                         I try to better myself. I'm always saying, 
                         "You know, I learned something today..." 
                         and what does this so-called God give 
                         me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't 
                         make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow.

                         be happy because he has his own amusement 
                         park, but, he's gonna find out that 
                         without other people, the rides are 
                         totally lame. I mean, who could really 
                         have fun by themselves at a theme park? 
                         I'll bet he's sick of it already.

                         for you working security, I'll let you 
                         ride two rides a day. But only two rides, 
                         and only if I'm not on them.
 
                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          But, you can ride anything you want. 
                         And you don't have to wait in line.
 
                         
                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         I'm not interested.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude, are you from Mars or something? 
                         Any ride you want. No lines.
 
                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         If you need security, I need a cash 
                         salary.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         But I don't have any cash. I spent everything 
                         on this park.
 
                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Well, look: Why don't you just let a 
                         couple of people in each day? Every 
                         day you can just let two people in, 
                         charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you 
                         can use that to pay my daily salary.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Ugh. Two people?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         This place is huge. You'll never notice 
                         two people. And then you'll have security 
                         for your park.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open 
                         the park to two people each day! But 
                         remember: anybody else you see trespassing 
                         the park...

                         You're a very lucky little boy. I've 
                         never seen a hemorrhoid so infected.

                         is here to see you.
 
                                     STAN

                         Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid 
                         trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, 
                         and it got infected. I really need to 
                         go to the bathroom, but if I do, it 
                         will pop again and the pain will make 
                         me pass out. How are you?
 
                                     STAN
                         Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman 
                         is letting a few people each day into 
                         his theme park. I wa thinking we could 
                         put on disguises and get in.

                         any amusement park rides for over a 
                         year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.

                         But it's okay, Stan, because I finally 
                         figured it out. You see, if someone 
                         like Cartman can get a million dollars 
                         and his own theme park, then there is

                                     KYLE
                          Awesome. 

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Kyle, we wanna tell you about the book 
                         of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         I've had enough of the Bible. What has 
                         it gotten me?
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Oh, I think you'll see differently after 
                         hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay. 
                          You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan 
                         a long long time ago.  Job was a great 
                         man. He was blessed with ten lovely 
                         children , a wonderful wife, and many 
                         friends. 
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                          He was godly, and a good man, and fed 
                         the poor. 
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         He was the most upright and honorable 
                         of men, and every day he praised God. 
                         
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         But one day, Satan went up to heaven 
                         and talked to God.
 
                                     KYLE
                          Satan talked to God?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Yes, in the book of Job, Satan talks 
                         to God. And God says to Satan, "Have 
                         you seen Job? He is a great man, and 
                         he praises me every day."
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises 
                         you because you gave him so much. If 
                         you didn't give him those things, he 
                         would curse your name."
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show 
                         you, Satan! I'll take those things away 
                         from Job and he will still praise my 
                         name."
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         And so, God had a bunch of barbarians 
                         come in and slaughter Job's oxen and 
                         donkeys, and murder all his workers. 
                         
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Then God sent his fireballs from the 
                         sky and killed his sheep and the rest 
                         of his employees. 
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         And then, as Job's sons and daughters 
                         were eating, God sent a mighty wind 
                         to collapse the house and crush and 
                         kill them all. 
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Job was terribly sad, but he fell to 
                         his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, 
                         and the Lord taketh away," and praised 
                         God's name. 
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         So then, Job got painful sores all over 
                         his body. 
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         He was in terrible, miserable pain all 
                         day, every day. But he still kept his 
                         faith. 
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         God said to Sata, "See? I told you. 
                         Job still praises me." 
 
                                     KYLE
                          And that's it? That's the end?

                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Basically.

                                     KYLE
                         That's the most horrible story I've 
                         ever heard. Why would God do such a 
                         horrible thing to a good person just 
                         to prove a point to Satan?
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.

                                     KYLE
                         Then I was right. Job has all his children 
                         killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep 
                         making movies. There isn't a God.

                          Welcome back to Money Quest.  In just 
                         over two weeks, young financial genius 
                         Eric Cartman  has managed to turn a 
                         theme park that was seeing less than 
                         a hundred attendees a day into a thriving 
                         park with attendance in the thousands.

                         And the way he did it is with the brilliant 
                         "You Can't Come" technique. For the 
                         first several days, the young businessman 
                         saturated the market with the claim 
                         that nobody could get into his park. 
                         It made the public crazy. So then, weeks 
                         later, when he opened the doors, they 
                         were lining up around the block. Simply 
                         amazing.

                          I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing 
                         the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid 
                         has spread to his lungs. Normally, the 
                         body would fight the infection, but 
                         he's... he's just... given up on life.

                         just... lost his will to live.
