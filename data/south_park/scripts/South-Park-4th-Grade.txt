                         He's right. We have to take a hard stance 
                         right now and establish that we're the 
                         dominant ones in this relationship!

                         all jump up on our desks and pull down 
                         our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!"

                         down,  should we stand frontways or 
                         back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, 
                         or-ar our w-wieners?

                         ...I think showing her our asses should 
                         be quite sufficient, Butters.

                         Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this 
                         , with our wieners pokin' through the 
                         back of our legs, you know, and give 
                         'er a nice fruit bowl.

                         Okay, so it's decided. When the clock 
                         hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, 
                         pull down our pants and yell, "KISS 
                         MY ASS!!!"

                         to see just how special it was.
 
               [wistfully]

               Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?

               In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons

               [Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land]

               We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue

               [Cartman makes a glitter picture of a cow's face]

               and a boy's bloody head in the other]

               go back for one minute

                         When it comes to time-traveling theory, 
                         there are basically two school of thought. 
                         The Spock Theory is that a sling shot 
                         around the sun could create a wormhole 
                         in which time could not escape. The 
                         Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, 
                         is that a nag vibration could create 
                         a rip in the time-space continuum-

                         Yes, there are times in our life that 
                         we wish we could relive, but, if we 
                         already lived them perfectly, why live 
                         them again? The adventure of life is 
                         that there's always something new. New 
                         challenges, new experiences. A fun game 
                         is a game that gets harder as it goes.

                         You know, I, I feel like I can start 
                         anew. If it's alright with you, I'd 
                         like to go back to teaching the third 
                         grade!

                         Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people.
