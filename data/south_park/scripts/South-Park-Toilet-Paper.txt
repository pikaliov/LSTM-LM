               [South Park Elementary, day. A new classroom. As the camera follows 
               a new teacher around, the following kids are seen working with 
               clay. Clyde presses the pottery wheel pedal as Bebe molds a vase 
               on the wheel. Wendy watches. Tweek, Red, and Pip work on clay 
               on the table near the wall. In the foreground, Token presses 
               the pottery wheel pedal as Jordan molds a vase. Butters, Kevin, 
               and another kid work on their own projects. Kenny, Stan, Kyle 
               and Cartman are laughing at their project, which didn't require 
               the use of the pottery wheel.]

                         Hey, uh, you guys here what happened 
                         last night? Mrs. Dreible's house got 
                         covered with toilet paper.
 
                                     CLYDE
                         Yeah. They say it's gonna take three 
                         weeks to get it all down.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Dreible probably 
                         had it comin' to her.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         I don't know. I don't think anybody 
                         deserves that kind of brutality.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, I understand the people who did 
                         it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like 
                         nobody will ever know the geniuses who 
                         masterminded that perfect crime. 
 
                         
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Okay children, let's take our seats. 
                         Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, 
                         the counselor wants to see you in his 
                         office, now.
 
                                     CARTMAN

                         us that TP'ed that house?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing 
                         on us! As long as we all stick to our 
                         story, we'll be fine.
 
                                     STAN
                         We'd better go over our story again 
                         so we don't screw it up.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay. Last night, all four of us were 
                         at the bowling alley until about 7:30, 
                         at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, 
                         the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, 
                         was bowling in the lane next to us, 
                         and we asked her for her autograph, 
                         but she didn't have a pen, so we followed 
                         her out to her car, but on the way we 
                         were accosted by five Scientologists 
                         who wanted to give us all personality 
                         tests, which were administered at the 
                         Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, 
                         at which time we accidentally boarded 
                         the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho 
                         de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, 
                         and finally got a ride home with a man 
                         who was missing his left index finger, 
                         named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 
                         11:46.
 
                                     KYLE
                         I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that 
                         personality test?
 
                                     STAN
                         Yes, dude!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Kyle, it's very simple: we followed 
                         Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the 
                         way we were accosted by five Scientologists

                         the talking, okay? He's better at being

                         in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome 
                         that becomes.

                         is it that you police such a small town. 
                         You must have had larger inspirations.

                         to the academy you had something to 
                         prove. You wanted to protect and serve, 
                         but mostly you wanted to protect yourself.

                          Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are 
                         most like males between the ages of 
                         8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents 
                         notice that much toilet paper missing, 
                         so they would have to have bought it 
                         themselves. Find out where the toilet 
                         paper came from, officer, and you just 
                         might catch your man.
