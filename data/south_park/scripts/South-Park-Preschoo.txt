                         From the test results, it would appear 
                         your child was tortured by a bully. 
                         He received a massive snuggie, his underwear 
                         pulled up so high it nearly killed him. 
                         He also received two Indian sunburns 
                         on his forearms, a charlie horse on 
                         the thigh, and a second-degree titty 
                         twister. And from the damage to his 
                         head area, it appears he was also given 
                         a swirly, a colossal one.  It also appears 
                         like he received a noogie, and, a Polish 
                         bike ride.
