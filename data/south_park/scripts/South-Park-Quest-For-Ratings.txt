                         The price of milk money will go up next 
                         Monday to 49 cents. The school claims 
                         the added money is due to the cow shortage 
                         in South Park County.

                         Parent-teacher conferences will be held 
                         this Wednesday night, from seven to 
                         nine. So kids, get a lot of playing 
                         in before you get grounded. And now, 
                         for a look at what's on the menu for 
                         school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.

                         Eric, it looks as though the school 
                         will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now 
                         that's traditionally a uh, a white meat 
                         chicken... breast, if you will, that 
                         has been breaded, and then cooked. I've 
                         been told there will also be tater-tots, 
                         and a vegetable dish. This is really 
                         shaping up to be a ah ah one fantastic 
                         lunch. Eric?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks 
                         a lot. And now, here with the celebrity 
                         watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen 
                         any celebrities?

                         Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' 
                         out in front of the school for about 
                         ...two hours now ah, and I haven't seen 
                         any celebrities. Uh about thirty minutes 
                         ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, 
                         but ih ih turn- it turns out it was 
                         a dead horse.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                          Will do.

                         More snow for South P... p-p Park. Here's 
                         Token Black with the weather.

                          Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive 
                         snow storm is headed South Park's way. 
                         I asked my dad last night and he said 
                         that he heard the snow storm is expected 
                         on Tuesday. Guys?

                         Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look 
                         at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball 
                         team just can't get it right.

                          Another devastating loss for the Cows 
                         last night, Eric. They were ahead in 
                         the game until Kelly Anderson crying 
                         because she missed her daddy, who's 
                         on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, 
                         Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, 
                         and the Cows had to forfeit.

                         Cows are on a six and O slide since 
                         Kelly's father left for that business 
                         trip.

                         Yeah, I think that was one of our best 
                         shows yet.

                          Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. 
                         The school has to cancel your show?

                         Well, the students just aren't watching 
                         ya. Your rating was only a four this 
                         whole week.

                         How many students is that?

                                     MR. MERYL
                         Four.  Four students watch your show. 
                         And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting 
                         a 57!
 
                                     STAN

                         What is that butthole doing now?!

                                     MR. MERYL
                         O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just 
                         video footage of animals close-up with 
                         a wide angle lens.

                         But that's... that's crap! That's not 
                         even TV!
 
                                     MR. MERYL
                         It's what the students want, and it's 
                         cheaper to make than yoru show. Just 
                         one person and a video camera. Craig 
                         is a genius. Uh sorry, kids.

                          But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring 
                         the news to the students. They need 
                         to know the facts, and our news team 
                         them, very much.
 
                                     MR. MERYL
                         Kids don't care about the news, boys. 
                         It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, 
                         close-up, with a wide angle lens.

                         Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is 
                         our life. Withot it, we have nothing.
 
                         
                                     MR. MERYL
                         I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud 
                         of what you've done. It's just that 
                         it's kind of gay. 
 
                                     CARTMAN

                         with the school, heh. They're paying

                         I can't believe you would betray us 
                         like that?! We've always been supercool 
                         to you!  Ah whatever, Kenny!

                         of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, 
                         we just need to figure out how to make

                         African-Americans on the news, not hearing 
                         them. That's why all African-Americans 
                         newspeople learn to talk more... wha,

                         the great African-Americans newspeople 
                         have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak

                         it'll really help our ratings.

                         reporting. I remember when we all made 
                         an oath to each other, way back when 
                         started playing news reporter, that 
                         we would never let anything jeopardize 
                         our integrity! Well our integrity is 
                         jeopardized! And if we can't report 
                         news the honest way, what good is n-news 
                         reporting?

               then a flash of plasma, then an aminated Mandelbrot design, then 
               a prize-winning dog on a pedestal. A bell sounds. Next, a tunnel 
               with blue light, which ends up at a performance of some sort, 
               a time-lapse shot of rolling clouds, another Mandelbrot animation,
