                         I'm a little concerned about some of

                         You just heard your son talking about

                         and you said "Who the heck do these 
                         people think they are?!" I I'm really, 
                         truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen

                         Randy, the last thing we want is for 
                         people to think we're pushing our religion. 
                         We know there are a lot of beliefs out 
                         there and ours just works for us.

                                     RANDY
                         Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, 
                         I've never known any Mormons. I, don't 
                         even know what you people believe. Who 
                         was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he 
                         believe that Native Americans are actually 
                         white people from Jerusalem?

                         Well, because they found ancient books 
                         they had written on gold plates, right 
                         where the angel Moroni said they would 
                         be.

                         Last night, a Native America angel told 
                         me where I could find another testament 
                         of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the 
                         woods. I dug around all morning where 
                         the angel had told me to look.

                         seer stones. Under that, I found four 
                         gold plates written in strange writing 
                         .

                         take them. You see, after I found the 
                         plates, the angel Moroni appeared to 
                         me again and said that I am not allowed 
                         to show the plates, or the seer stones, 
                         to anybody. Because first I must translate 
                         what's written on the plates into English,

                         Well, he kept them hidden from everyone 
                         like he was told. And then he translated 
                         what was written on the plates into 
                         the Book of Mormon.

                         All right, here. I'm gonna hide these 
                         pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating 
                         off of golden plates, then he'll be 
                         able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith 
                         is making it all up, then the new translations 
                         will be different from these.

                         Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.

               Martin Harris dumb.

               So Martin went on back to Smith

               Said the pages had gone away

               Smith got mad and told Martin

               He needed to go pray

                         pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready 
                         to write it all down again if you translate 
                         from the plates.
 
                                     SMITH
                         I would love to, Martin, except, I just 
                         had a vision. And the Lord said he's 
                         very angry with me for letting you take 
                         those pages.

                         Yes. He is so mad that he will never 
                         let me translate from the plate of Lehi 
                         again. He's... we must now translate 
                         from the plate of Nephi. So it will 
                         be the same basic story, but written 
                         a little differently.
 
                                     HARRIS
                         Wow! If God got angry with you, then 
                         you must be tellin' the truth.

                         ...Wait. Mormons actually know this 
                         story and they still believe Joseph 
                         Smith was a prophet?
 
                                     GARY SR.
                         Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't 
                         it?
 
                                     STAN
                         No, it proves he DID make it all up. 
                         Are you blind?

                         Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         No, it's a matter of logic! If you're 
                         gonna say things that have been proven 
                         wrong, like that the first man and woman 
                         lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans 
                         came from Jerusalem, then you'd better 
                         have something to back it up. All you've 
                         got are a bunch of stories about some 
                         asswipe who read plates nobody ever 
                         saw out of a hat, and then couldn't 
                         do it again when the translatios were 
                         hidden!

                         to be your friend anymore.

                         Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in 
                         crazy stories that make absolutely no 
                         sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make 
                         it all up, but I have a great life. 
                         and a great family, and I have the Book 
                         of Mormon to thank for that. The truth 
                         is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made 
                         it all up, because what the church teaches 
                         now is loving your family, being nice 
                         and helping people. And even though 
                         people in this town might think that's 
                         stupid, I still choose to believe in 
                         it. All I ever did was try to be your 
                         friend, Stan, but you're so high and 
                         mighty you couldn't look past my religion 
                         and just be my friend back. You've got 
                         a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck 
                         my balls.
