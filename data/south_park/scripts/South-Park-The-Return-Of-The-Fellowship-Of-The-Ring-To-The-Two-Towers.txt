                         O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest 
                         do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Only one thing can save our kingdom. 
                         You must bring me: a piece of pecan 
                         pie with toffee ice cream and magic 
                         shell. Hurry now!

                         That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of 
                         another one!

                          Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to 
                         borrow the Lord of the Rings video we 
                         rented. Could you take it over to them?
 
                         
                                     STAN
                         You're sending us on... a quest? You 
                         ask of us to take the one video to the 
                         House of Butters?
 
                                     RANDY
                         Yeah, whatever.

                                     CARTMAN
                         It shall be a long journey with many 
                         dangers on the way.
 
                                     KYLE
                         But if the tape must be brought to the 
                         House of Butters, who else can do it?
 
                         
                                     STAN
                          Very well, we shall embark on this 
                         quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!

                          Hmmm, that gets rid of them.

                         you?
 
                                     RANDY
                         Yeah, well uh, the Lord of the Rings 
                         wasn't the only thing I rented from 
                         the video store.  I also rented... a 
                         porno.
 
                                     SHARON
                         Oho, you little devil.

                                     RANDY
                          Youuu wanna go watch?

               [The neighborhood streets, night. The boys are well into their 
               quest]

                         How shall we journey to the house of 
                         Butters? Through the mines of Endor 
                         or over the mountains of Grog?
 
                                     KYLE
                          Look out! Here comes the great dragon 
                         of Perengraph!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. 
                         I can shield us from the dragon's fire.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And so the party journeyed onward: the 
                         great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and 
                         the covetous Jew.

                         Jews can't be Paladins.

               [Stan's house, night. As the kid journey, Randy and Sharon are 
               in their room getting ready for a night of porno. Sharon appears

               the master bathroom and runs her finger along the bedroom wall.

                         The guys at the office told me I had 
                         to rent this porno. They said "this 
                         is without a doubt thee hottest porno

                         This is awful! I just know with every 
                         passing minute, little Kyle is seeing 
                         more and more depraved sex acts!

                         Oh hey guys, uh. We were just about 
                         to come home. We had to return the video.

                         A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's 
                         some things we need to put into context 
                         for you. You see, a man puts his penis 
                         into a woman's vagina for both love 
                         and pleasure. But sometimes the woman 
                         lays on top of the man facing the other 
                         way so that they can put each other's 
                         genitals in their mouths.  Uh this is 
                         called "sixty-nining" and it's normal.
 
                         
                                     SHARON
                         See boys, a woman is sensitive in her 
                         vagina and it... feels good to have 
                         a man's penis inside of it.
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         That's right, but sometimes a woman 
                         chooses to use other things. Telephones, 
                         staplers, magazines. It's because the 
                         nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, 
                         it's like a fun tickle.
 
                                     KYLE'S FATHER
                         Now, on to double penetration, boys. 
                         You see, sometimes when a woman has 
                         sex with more than one man, each man 
                         makes love to a different orifice.
 
                         
                                     RANDY
                         That's right. It's something adults 
                         can do with really good friends in a 
                         comfortable setting.

                         It's also important that you understand 
                         why some people choose to urinate on 
                         each other.

                         Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover 
                         is something people might do, but you 
                         must make sure your partner is okay 
                         with it before you start doing it.
