                         You see, son, fads come and go. And 
                         this "Chin-po-ko Mon" is obviously nothing 
                         more than a fad. You don't have to be 
                         a part of it. In fact, you can make 
                         an even stronger statement by saying 
                         to your peers, "I'm not going to be 
                         a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."

                         you how it works in the real world. 
                         In the real world, I can either get 
                         a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only 
                         kid without one, which singles me out, 
                         and causes the other kids to make fun

                         that could be worse on a child's mind

                         And now, for a special annoucement from 
                         the President of the United States.

                          My fellow Americans, I wish to address 
                         the concerns many of us have over the 
                         growing number of Japanese military 
                         bases forming in the United States. 
                         The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, 
                         has made our own children into fighter 
                         pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and 
                         attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. 
                         Hirohito this morning, and he assured 
                         me that I have a very large penis. He 
                         said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and 
                         absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, 
                         he assured me, was nearly microscopic 
                         in size. My penis, he said, was most 
                         likely one of the biggest on the planet. 
                         I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. 
                         Thank you.

                          Isn't that cool?
 
                                     STAN
                          No.  Screw this, dude.

                         Where are you going, Stan?

                                     STAN
                         Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just 
                         doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm 
                         gonna go kill some ants or something.

                         Wait for me, I wanna get out of these 
                         stupid clothes.

                         Well, you were right, Sharon. The best 
                         way to make our kids not like something 
                         is to like it ourselves.
 
                                     SHARON
                         That's right. Anything we like is instantly 
                         not cool.  We know how to take them 
                         out, Mr. Garrison! Spread the word! 
                         Get on the wire to every parent around 
                         the country and tell them how to bring 
                         those sons of bitches down!

                         Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little 
                         nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can 
                         I have $5 to buy a football?
 
                                     SHARON
                         You bet, Stanley!

                          Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.

                         Yeah, dude, that's way over.

                         Dude, you're just jealous because I'm 
                         Chinpoko Master!
 
                                     STAN
                         No, Kyle. You see, we learned something 
                         today. This whole Chinpokomon thing 
                         happened because we all followed the 
                         group. We only liked Chinpokomon because 
                         everyone else did. And look at the damage 
                         it caused.
 
                                     KYLE
                         So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman 
                         because you all don't?
 
                                     STAN
                         ...Ye-eah.

                                     KYLE
                         But if I stop now, I'll just be going 
                         with the group again. So, to be an individual, 
                         I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
                         
 
                                     STAN
                         Oh. Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You 
                         see, Kyle, I learned something, just 
                         now. It is good to go with the group. 
                         A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
