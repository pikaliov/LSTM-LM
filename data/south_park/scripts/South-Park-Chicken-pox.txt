                         It's a good thing we got her to the 
                         hospital in time.

                         But what's wrong with her?

                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         It's chicken pox. There seems to be 
                         a small epidemic going around. Your 
                         daughter never had the chicken pox as 
                         a little child, I take it?
 
                                     SHARON
                         No, uh-no, she's been perfectly healthy.
 
                         
                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         Well, that's the problem. You see, chicken 
                         pox is a pretty normal thing for young 
                         children. But as you get older it becomes 
                         more and more a- ferocious disease.

                         your little brother, Stan.

                          Oh, whoo-peee!

                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         You know, most people don't realize 
                         that chicken pox is actually a form 
                         of herpes.
 
                                     STAN
                         Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
 
                         
                                     SHELLEY
                         Shut up, brat!

                                     SHARON
                          Will my daughter be okay?

                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         She'll be fine.

                                     SHELLEY
                          Stop it!

                                     DR. DOCTOR
                         We just want to be cautious and monitor 
                         her here.
 
                                     STAN
                          OOOWWW! 

                                     SHARON
                         Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a 
                         kiss and then we have to go.

                         Â…and then the doctor said that it's 
                         much worse as you get older. My daughter 
                         is in pretty bad shape now, but if she 
                         were in her twenties, she could die.

                         My God, I never knew chicken pox was 
                         such a dangerous illness.
 
                                     LIANE
                         I guess it's much better to get it when 
                         you're young.
 
                                     SHARON
                         So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started 
                         thinking that we should intentionally 
                         have our boys play with a child who 
                         has the chicken pox. Let them get it 
                         now, while they're young.
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers 
                         do it all the time.
 
                                     LIANE
                         Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother 
                         had me go over to a little girl's house 
                         who had the chicken pox, just so I would 
                         get it.
 
                                     SHARON
                         So it's not such a crazy idea after 
                         all?
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange 
                         little boy Kenny has the chicken pox 
                         right now.

                         slumber party at your friend Kenny's 
                         house tonight?

                         No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; 
                         they live in the ghetto.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party 
                         here.

                         Kenny's, and that's final!

                         over at Kenny's so bad.

                         have Nintendo!  Well, here's Kenny's 
                         house.

                         payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed 
                         upon us. Andn since we have been faithful

                         waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the 
                         toaster and you cook 'em!

                         seems silly that they don't even talk

                         It's impossible!

               live in a world of only gods, so my idea to make Ameica better 
               is put all the poor people into camps.

               If we get rid of them, there will be nothing but rich people. 
               And there won't be any hunger, poverty, or homeless people. 'Cause 
               they'll all be dead. The end.

                       Last stop: Cartman's house. She 
                       goes into Liane's room and pulls out 
                       some panties, then rubs them all over 
                       her face. Cartman jumps for joy. They 
                       all return to Stan's house, and she 
                       licks away at some wine glasses and 
                       the phone receiver. Stan and Kyle high-five 
                       each other again. Finally, they pay 
                       her and she leaves. ]

                         sick! You have to get back to the hospital

                          The doctor says that maybe you can 
                         go home tomorrow.

                         Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?

                         We gave you guys herpes.

                         We got you back for getting us sick. 
                         We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes 
                         and stuff.

                         I can't believe you gave us herpes. 
                         You little rascals!

                          Well, I guess it serves us right.  
                         Kids, we should have honest about wanting 
                         you to get chicken pox.
 
                                     KYLE'S MOTHER
                         It's true. We were wrong for deceiving 
                         you about it.

                         Anduh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. 
                         I realize that I shouldn't be so cold 
                         towards people that are less fortunate 
                         than me.
 
                                     STUART
                         Waww hell, I'm sorry, too.

                         turned out for the better.
