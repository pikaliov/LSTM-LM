                                     A BRITISH PERSON
                          Aaah.  Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone 
                         streets, cragging London buildings, 
                         and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. 
                          Hello, I'm a British person. For years 
                         now, the character Pip has been featured 
                         prominently in the American show, South 
                         Park. However, many Americans don't 
                         realize where Pip came from. He's the 
                         prowling little adorable Englishman 
                         from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, 
                         "Great Expectations"  And so tonight, 
                         the makers of South Park have agreed 
                         to take a break from their regular show, 
                         and instead present the prestigious 
                         Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning 
                         to end. Indeed, after watching this 
                         show, you'll know the timeless classic 
                         as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. 
                         Our story is set in England, in the 
                         small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, 
                          where a young blond-haired boy named 
                         Pip was on his way to see his parents.
 
                         
               [Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, day. Pip leaves the town, crosses 
               an open field, enters an enclosed lot and stops right in front 
               of the camera]

                         is nice to see you again.  Don't worry. 
                         Sister is still taking very good care 
                         of me. She just loves to smack me in 
                         the face and tell me I'm worthless. 
                         O, we have such fun together.  But it's 
                         getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see 
                         you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!

                         sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite

                         I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look!

                         they would play, sometimes they would 
                         talk. But every single day Pip's love

                         Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He 
                         was hired to be the friend of the very 
                         harsh and beautiful Estella. And although 
                         she treated him like dirt, or perhaps 
                         because she treated him like dirt, Pip 
                         found himself more in love with the 
                         little girl each and every day.  Oh, 
                         bless him! Isn't he lovely??  But, isn't 
                         it sad? Because Pip knew that someone 
                         as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella 
                         could never love him, for he was just 
                         a simple blacksmith's apprentice.

                         You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. 
                         Now on to Ms. Havesham: She was raised 
                         by a wealthy father and grew up to be 
                         a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now 
                         I might mention, Pip, that in London 
                         it is not the custom to put the knife 
                         in the mouth.
 
                                     PIP
                          Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! 

                                     POCKET
                          Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. 
                         Havesham grew up to be a lovely young 
                         lady, and soon a man came along, which 
                         gets me to the cruel part of the story, 
                         merely breaking off, Pip , to remark 
                         that a dinner napkin should never be 
                         placed into the tumbler.
 
                                     PIP
                          Sorry! Sorry!

                          Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man 
                         pursued Ms. Havesham closely and professed 
                         to be devoted to her. She passionately 
                         loved him back. The marriage day was 
                         fixed, the wedding dress was bought, 
                         the wedding guests were all invited, 
                         and finally the day came. But not the 
                         groom.  And I break from the tale now 
                         only to mention that one should never 
                         pass gas at the dinner table!
 
                                     PIP
                         Oh. Excuse me.

                         Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never 
                         showed. He simply wrote a letter, a 
                         letter that Ms. Havesham received 20 
                         minutes before the wedding.

                         At half nine, the time when she stopped 
                         all the clocks in the house.

                         But afterward she laid waste to the 
                         entire house, as you have seen it, and 
                         has never since looked upon the light 
                         of day. And the story ends, Pip, with 
                         me suggesting that one should never 
                         pull out the wee wee and check it for 
                         scabs whilst at the table.

                         And so Pip spent the next several months 
                         learning how to be a gentleman. He was 
                         schooled in several languages. He was 
                         taught fencing and marksmanship, and 
                         he was shown how to dance and eat box. 
                         And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks 
                         of intense schooling, Pip was finally 
                         a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, 
                         Pip decided to pay Ms. Havesham a visit, 
                         to thank her for her generosity, and 
                         to see if he was indeed, now, good enough 
                         for Estella.

                         Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite 
                         the gentleman now, aren't you?

                         Perhaps. Estella's been off to school 
                         as well.  She's become quite the lady.

                         Do you know what love is, Pip? It is 
                         blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, 
                         utter submission, trust and belief against 
                         yourself and against the whole world, 
                         giving up your whole heart and soul 
                         to snip it.

                         Love her, Pip. I developed her into 
                         what she is so that she might... be loved.

                         tears your heart into pieces. And as 
                         you get older it will tear deeper.  
                         Lover her.

                         Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. 
                         From the apprentice of a blacksmith 
                         to a fine young gentleman of great expectations.

                         Estella again at a Grand Ball held by 
                         the King of England, Tony Blair. It 
                         was here that Pip would finally and 
                         formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend.

                         away to become a gentleman so that I 
                         could be with Estalla.

                         to break my heart, you did a very good 
                         job of it. Because it certainly does 
                         hurt.
