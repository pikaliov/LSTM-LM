               [The Mayor's office, day. The mayor is at her desk, flanked by 
               her assistants. Before her are Chef and Jimbo. The meeting starts]
 
               
                                     MAYOR
                         Gentlemen, I understand you are here 
                         to present both sides of an issue. I 
                         wanna hear you both out and do this 
                         in a civil and constructive manner so 
                         that I can give you both the time and 
                         attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't 
                         you begin?
 
                                     JIMBO
                         Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.
 
                         
                                     MAYOR
                          Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!
 
                         
                                     JIMBO
                         We cannot change the South Park flag, 
                         Mayor!
 
                                     CHEF
                         Mayor, as I've said before, I find that 
                         flag to be racist and insensitive!
 
                         
                                     JIMBO
                         Chef, I respect you very much, but you 
                         have to understand that this has been 
                         the South Park flag since some of our 
                         ancestors, like my great-grandfather, 
                         founded this land!
 
                                     CHEF
                         That flag represents a time when blacks 
                         were persecuted by whites! How can a 
                         black man not be bothered by it?!
 
                         
                                     MAYOR
                         Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants 
                         hold up the flag.  and you tell me what 
                         exactly you find racist about it. 
 
                         
                                     CHEF
                         You don't see anything wrong with that 
                         flag?!
 
                                     JIMBO
                         Chef, what about the baseball team, 
                         the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they 
                         change their name because it's racist?
 
                         
                                     CHEF
                         Yeah!

                                     JIMBO
                         No, because it's their history!

                                     CHEF
                         Look, I have gone to every quiet protest 
                         I could! I have written everyone; I've 
                         put up signs! But now I'm telling you 
                         , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!
 
                                     JIMBO
                         And I'm telling you it WON'T!

                                     MAYOR
                          Oh, boy.

               [South Park Elementary, day. The class bell rings and the kids 
               are in their seats. Timmy is now shown with the class.]
 
                                     MR. WYLAND
                         Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, 
                         I would like to turn the class's attention 
                         to current issues. Some people think 
                         the South Park flag should be changed, 
                         while others believe that changing the 
                         flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect 
                         subject for your debate club.
 
                                     CLASS

                                     MR. WYLAND
                         I see that you've already had a lot 
                         of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice 
                         vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, 
                         a-and People Against the Clubbing of 
                         Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, 
                         the winner of all your debates so far 
                         has been... Cartman.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Thaaat's ri-ight.

                         Cartman doesn't always win! He just 
                         gets pissed off and goes home so we 
                         can't debate anymore!
 
                                     CLASS
                          Yeah.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than 
                         you guys!

                         about half the time!
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yes I do!

                         Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm 
                         going home!

                         Told ya.

                                     MR. WYLAND
                         Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. 
                         Garrison, I want you all to go out and 
                         research this debate before we pick 
                         teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose 
                         which side of this poignant debate you 
                         are on.

                         This is about history, kids.  If you 
                         don't have respect for your past, then 
                         you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then 
                         you can never expect to have a future. 
                         Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots 
                         and flags because they're not  "politically 
                         correct." Well, where does it end? I 
                         mean, people are gonna start sayin' 
                         that the Denver Broncos are offensive 
                         to horses. And then we'll have to- a 
                         SQUIRREL!  Aand then we'll have to change 
                         everything, and pretty soon all our 
                         history will be forgotten. But to REALLY 
                         understand the South Park's flag's importance, 
                         you need to know about South Park's 
                         history. Ned here's a big history buff, 
                         and he can tell you the whole story.

                         the flag.

               Mr. Wyland	Alright. Stan and Kyle, [turns and writes on the board] 
               you can both be the team leaders for the "Flag should stay the

                         Park flag racist, and we certainly understand 
                         your case.  We have been diligently 
                         working on this problem, put in a lot 
                         of hours, and we have finally altered 
                         the flag in a way that we think will 
                         make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There.

                         Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals 
                         to the history argument.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
 
                         
                                     WENDY
                         Huh?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I mean, Germany was united under the 
                         swastika, right? But,... obviously history 
                         wasn't as important as changing the 
                         views after the war and stuff, so hey 
                         changed it.
 
                                     WENDY
                          Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     WENDY
                         Not bad at all. I may make that our 
                         first argument. 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Cool.

                                     WENDY
                         Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. 
                         
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Really? Mine too. What I really like 
                         to do, is I like to take the tops off 
                         of two cookies, and then put them together 
                         and make "quadruple stuffs."
 
                                     WENDY
                         Hey, that's what I always do, too!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         No way!

                                     WENDY
                         Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have 
                         anything in common with you, Cartman.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Me neither.

                                     WENDY
                         Aha ha.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh.

                                     WENDY, CARTMAN
                         Well, anyway, let's get back to work. 
                         
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Whoa.

                                     WENDY
                         Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say 
                         that first we talk about the history 
                         of the flag.  We can show that the- 
                         
 
                                     CARTMAN
                          Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.

                                     WENDY
                         No.  You go ahead.

                         of business tonight is to have Brother 
                         Anderson update us on last week's minutes.

                         Last week we decided we hate blacks 
                         and Jews. A lot!

                         know, this fine city is holding a vote 
                         on whether or or not to change their

                         Look, we have to accept the fact that 
                         most people in the world hate us, right?

                         So, whatever side we're on is the side 
                         that's gonna lose, right?

                         So why don't we all say that we want 
                         the flag changed. That way, most folks'll 
                         vote to keep it the way it is.

                         tell everyone that we want the flag 
                         changed, so that they will all vote 
                         against us!

                         that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate 
                         tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes!

                         history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.

                          Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have 
                         something to tell you.

                         Why would you tell me this? Why would 
                         you tell anyone this?

                         Because I don't know what to do. I can't 
                         concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, 
                         then I can't win the debate tomorrow.

                         Alright, look. When two people work 
                         closely for a long time, sometimes they 
                         feel what's called, "sexual tension." 
                         Sometimes you just have to act on impulse 
                         and get it over with.

                         all the parents for their support of 
                         our debate club.  I r-realize that many 
                         of you are torn by the issues as well, 
                         so, perhaps the children can shed some 
                         light on us. We'll start with Wendy

                          Yes. Now, the main point we would like 
                         to make is oftentimes it is prudent 
                         to change history. As times change we 
                         hope to grow, and as we grow our rules 
                         must change. It is a natural part of 
                         evolution. Thank you.

                         Our main point is that the flag shouldn't 
                         offend anyone, because killing has been 
                         around since the bieginning of time. 
                         All animals kill.  And the animals that 
                         don't kill are stupid ones, like cows 
                         and turtles and stuff. So people should 
                         not be so upset about killing.

                         that they didn't even make a separation 
                         of black and white to begin with. All 
                         they saw when they looked at that flag

                         South Park. We've all done a lot of 
                         growing this week.  Everyone was afraid 
                         to take a stand on this issue. But now 
                         we have learned once again that black, 
                         white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we 
                         are all just people. And so, I am very
