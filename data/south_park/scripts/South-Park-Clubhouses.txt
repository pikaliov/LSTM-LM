                         Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind 
                         enemy lines. His only chance of survival 
                         is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who 
                         stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's 
                         now or never. He must make a run for 
                         it.  American base is only a few feet 
                         away.

                         If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then 
                         we can invite them over to your clubhouse 
                         for dinner and play parlor games and

                         Stanley, I I know all this change must 
                         be tough on you, but you know, your- 
                         your mother and I thought it'd be best 
                         for all of us if we'd split up.

                          Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's 
                         Bar tonight.

                          I'm already there.  What were we talking 
                         about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and 
                         I still care about you and your sister. 
                         But we just don't like being around 
                         each other any more.
 
                                     STAN
                         Well, I don't like being around my sister 
                         anymore; does that mean I can leave 
                         her, too?

                         just can't leave family; you have to 
                         stick with family, no matter what.

                         But you and Mom are family; how come 
                         you can just split up?  You know what 
                         I think? I think that when you and Mom 
                         got married, you became family. And 
                         now that you are, you shouldn't be able 
                         to leave her anymore than I can leave 
                         my sister.

                         nice day.

                         I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.
