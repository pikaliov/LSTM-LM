               [Kyle's house, day. Stan and Kyle are happily preparing a snowman, 
               which now has twigs, buttons, a hat and scarf. Tweek stands behind 
               Stan holding a carrot.]
 
                                     STAN
                         Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek.

                         I can't.  You do it.

                                     KYLE
                         Just stick it on.

                                     TWEEK
                         But what if I put it in the wrong place? 
                         
 
                                     STAN
                         Just put it between his eyes.

                                     TWEEK
                         GARH. But what if, while I'm putting 
                         on the nose, the snowman comes to life 
                         and tries to kill me?
 
                                     STAN
                         Tweek, when has that ever happened, 
                         except for that one time?
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yeah.

                         No! I was looking in this magazine, 
                         and I found an ad for little ocean creatures 
                         that you can buy and raise in your room!

                         Look!  Sea people. You keep them under 
                         a big tank of water and they like, build 
                         castles and play basketball and stuff.

                         Yeah! And look! They ride around on 
                         turtles and they play games with fish.

                          Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative 
                         Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want 
                         everyone to call you Negative Nancy 
                         from now on.  Now, what we need is to 
                         all chip in four dollars, and we can 
                         have them here tonorrow!
 
                                     KYLE
                         Only sixteen dollars? They can't be 
                         cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
                          If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then 
                         it will be $5.35 per person!
 
                                     STAN
                         Alright, I'll chip in.

                                     TWEEK
                         Gah! Me too.

                         innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows 
                         that he actually has a dark underside... 
                          Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak 
                         havoc on the world that shunned me!

                         Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, 
                         General Disarray.
 
                                     DOUGIE
                         I have done as you asked and brought 
                         the first load of scrap wood.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Excellent, General Disarray! Now we 
                         can begin my most horrible evil plan 
                         yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
 
                                     DOUGIE
                         What dastardly deed are we doing now?
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Simple, my dear general.  We are going 
                         to block out the sun!
 
                                     DOUGIE
                          Oh. 

                                     BUTTERS
                         Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and 
                         figured that if we build a huge ...wooden 
                         shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty 
                         feet wide , precisely on this hill, 
                         South Park ...will forever be cast in 
                         a great shadow.
 
                                     DOUGIE
                         Oh, awesome!

                                     BUTTERS
                         Soon, all people will have to live like 
                         moles! They will love only to remember 
                         with sorrow how great the sun used to 
                         be! 
 
                                     DOUGIE
                         Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. 
                         
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          Huh?

                                     DOUGIE
                         They did that on the Simpsons. I think 
                         it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried 
                         to block Springfield from the sun.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was 
                         bein' original.
 
                                     DOUGIE
                         So how do we build it?

                                     BUTTERS
                         Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if 
                         they already did it on the Simpsons. 
                          I have to think of something else. 
                          Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I 
                         think of something clever, the Simpsons 
                         already did it?
 
               [Cartman's house, night. The living room light is on. Cartman 
               is sleeping, dreaming...]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... 
                          Yesss... Yeesss...
 
               [The dream sequence]

                                     CARTMAN
                         

               Look at me, livin' free

               Free and clean amongst the Sea People

               [the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take 
               him into the castle]
 
               We look for pirates and search for gold.

               Life is an adventure with the Sea People

               [A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As 
               a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.]
 
               
               They don't ever conplain, they don't call me fat.

               They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.

               [he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins 
               at the camera]
 
               This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
 
               
               [Shown walking with the sea couple again.]

               Sea people and me.

               Sea people and me, you guys.

               [The dream ends and the bubbles fade away. Cartman wakes up, 
               smiling]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. 
                          Only three hours and you can take me 
                         away from this crappy goddamned planet 
                         full of hippies. 
 
               [Cartman's house, day. He's at his desk with the new kit while 
               Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand behind him. His dressed as a monarch, 
               in suit, crown and cape.]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay. I've added the water purifier 
                         tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. 
                         Now it says  "Step 2.  Add the Sea People 
                         eggs to the water; you will see sea 
                         life spring instantly."  Okay, let's 
                         just run through this one more time: 
                         when the sea people arrive I will welcome 
                         them to South Park as Ambassador of 
                         Earth. Tweek, you give them the key 
                         to the city, and we'll all engage them 
                         in simple conversation. We've gotta 
                         make sea people feel comfortable, okay? 
                         Ready?

                         of the time that Bart Simpson  took 
                         the head of the Springfield statue in 
                         one of their classic episodes. Here's

                         was... really just doing an homage to 
                         the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.

                         yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!

                         Hey Butters.

                                     BUTTERS
                          Haaa!

                                     STAN
                         Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman 
                         says he has something really cool to 
                         show everybody. You've gotta come.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                          Ha ha! 

               [Cartman's house, whick now looks like a typical Springfield 
               house, day. In Cartman's room, everyone but Butters is shown 
               Simpsons-style. Present are Chef, Mr. Garrison, Liane, Tweek, 
               Timmy, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, and Butters. Cartman displays 
               his new sea ciety]
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Behold! You all see my tiny minions 
                         groveling at my likeness! I am Eric 
                         Cartman, god.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Hey. We paid for the sea people too. 
                         How come they're not making statues 
                         of us? 
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator 
                         of all things, yea.
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         That is very impressive, Eric. What 
                         do you intend to do with your underwater 
                         society?
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm gonna send a message to my people 
                         and tell 'em to develop a great machine 
                         that will shrink me down to their size, 
                         so I can live amongst them forever.
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                          Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!

                                     CARTMAN
                         What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
 
                         
                                     BUTTERS
                         They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse 
                         of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis 
                         tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria 
                         on it start to grow, and makes a little 
                         society, and they build a statue of 
                         her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                          ...So?

                                     KYLE
                         ...Yeah. So?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Dude, the Simpsons have done everything 
                         already. Who cares?
 
                                     STAN
                         Yeah, and they've been on the air for 
                         like, thirteen years. Of course they've 
                         done everything.
 
                                     MR .GARRISON
                         Every idea's been done, Butters, even 
                         before the Simpsons.
 
                                     CHEF
                         Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off 
                         of a Twilight Zone episode.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                         Really? So I shouldn't care if I come 
                         up with an idea, and the Simpsons already 
                         did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. 
                          Everything is back to normal, a, I 
                         think... I think I can go back to tryin' 
                         to destroy the world again.
 
                                     CHEF
                         Good for you!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get 
                         the hell out of my room.
 
                                     BUTTERS
                          I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready 
                         to wreak havoc once again! 
 
                                     STAN
                         Hey, look everybody! The other side 
                         of the aquarium is building another 
                         statue! 
 
                                     KYLE
                         Hey! It's Tweek.

                                     TWEEK
                         Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. 
                         That is waaay too much pressure.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         That is bullcrap! You'd better stop 
                         worshiping him, sea people! 
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         What's going on now?

                                     KYLE
                         The sea people from Cartman's side are 
                         suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's 
                         side.
 
                                     TWEEK
                         Gaaa-hah!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah! Go! 

                                     TWEEK
                         NOW what's happening?

                                     STAN
                         The sea people on Tweek's side just 
                         suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
 
                         
                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh God-damnit! 

                                     CARTMAN
                          Oh no! Oh the humanity!

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Well it was a nice project while it 
                         lasted, boys.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Yep. But I guess this proves that war 
                         is the natural order of life.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Why can't societies just live in peace?
 
                         
               THE END
