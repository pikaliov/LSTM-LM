                          Okay, children, let's take our seats. 
                          My name is Mr. Garrison. And I'm the 
                         new kindergarten teacher. I used to 
                         be the third grade teacher, but I had 
                         a little  "nervous breakdown" and went 
                         into the mountains where I lived off 
                         of  "rat carcasses"  But I'm all better 
                         now, and the school was nice enough 
                         to let me g n teaching, as long as it 
                         was for kindergarten.  But it's not 
                         a demotion. No. I mean, just because 
                         a teacher was teaching third grade and 
                         now is teaching kindergarten, that's 
                         not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, 
                         it's not. Well, let's start with role 
                         call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?

                         Broflovski --- I had your older brother 
                         Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a

                          Well that's bad news for everybody 
                         else, because I will be grading you

                         Keeper, because it was the Dawson's 
                         Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to 
                         an Eric Cartman in South Park which

                         and four a hybrid-assimilating computer 
                         linked with a satellite uplink computer. 
                         From there it was able to slowly take 
                         over every computer in the world.  It 
                         became stronger and stronger! Until, 
                         by the year 2018 it broke away from 
                         mankind  and there was nothing the humons 
                         could do.  It wasn't long before Mighty 
                         Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything 
                         as useless, including humons.  The nations 
                         tried everything to stop it.  Nuclear 
                         devices, seismic missiles. But nothng 
                         worked.  The humons built robots of 
                         their own, whole armies of them  But 
                         nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper 
                         Keeper.  And so finally, the humons 
                         decided to send one of their robots 
                         into the past to destroy the Trapper 
                         Keeper before it even got started.

                         class together. We have to respect one 
                         another or else we're in for a terrible 
                         school year.

                         You don't give a crap about them because 
                         they're not on your side! People like 
                         you preach tolerance and open-mindedness 
                         all the time, but when it comes to Middle

                         stupid country yokels who need your 
                         political enlightenment!! WELL, JUST

                         RESPECT THIS CLASS'S RIGHT TO MAKE UP
