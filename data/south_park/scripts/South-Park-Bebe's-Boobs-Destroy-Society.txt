                         Hi. Uh, the school called and said we 
                         all have to start going to class again.

                         At first I thought they were just mosquito

                          I know this has been a difficult couple 
                         o'weeks for you all with the untimely 
                         death of your teacher, but it's time 
                         for us to try to move on and learn,

                         teacher's tragic death yet. I need more 
                         time. It's just... it still hurts, you 
                         know? Can I go home?

                         to hide our emotions with math problems. 
                          M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication 
                         tables over here, m'kay. First we'll 
                         do uh, four time four, m'kay?

                         different about her.

                         Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get 
                         a haircut or something?
 
                                     KYLE

                         someone you could hang out with.

                         that Bebe chick always wears?

                         awesome shirt.

                         you chuck a rock at it. It's all about

                         I remember when I was a little girl 
                         the boys didn't think I was very smart 
                         at all. But then one day, they all started 
                         thinking I was really smart. I guess 
                         big smarts just run in our family.
 
                         
                                     BEBE
                         Well if the girls don't wanna be my 
                         friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, 
                         anyways.

                          You... guys wanted me to meet you here?

                         to have a talk

                          Alright guys, now that we're all here, 
                         I think... we need to have a difficult 
                         conversation. It's obvious that Bebe 
                         is the like the coolest, smartest, most 
                         awesome person we've ever met.
 
                                     STAN, KYLE
                         True.

                                     STAN
                         Yeah.

                                     KYLE
                         Yep.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And, you know, we've been trying to 
                         fill the gap for the fourth friend ever 
                         since Kenny died, God rest his soul, 
                         and it hasn't been an easy process.
 
                         
                                     KYLE
                         Right.

                                     STAN
                         Uh huh.

                                     CARTMAN
                         And so, even though I think it's a tough 
                         thing to do right now, I think maybe 
                         it's best for everyone if we make room 
                         to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.

                         Yeah.

                                     STAN
                         That would be best.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And 
                         so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's 
                         been really great, and we're gonna miss 
                         you.
 
                                     KYLE
                         Huh??

                         out, I'm sure you'll find other friends 
                         down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch 
                         for you, and some peanuts.

                         Let's give a big round of applause for 
                         Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.

                         have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. 
                         But we want you to know that its been 
                         really fun. Here's a watch, and some

                         Well hello there, little girl. My name 
                         is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you 
                         today? 
 
                                     BEBE
                         I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. 
                         
 
                                     DR. HALLIS
                         You?

                                     BEBE
                         Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars 
                         in nickels and a gold bracelet.
 
                                     DR. HALLIS
                         Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we 
                         don't offer breast reduction surgery 
                         to girls of your age.
 
                                     BEBE
                         Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones 
                         when she was a teenager. Why can't I 
                         have mine taken off?
 
                                     DR. HALLIS
                         Because making breasts larger is a beautiful 
                         and wonderful thing. Making them smaller 
                         is... insane.

                         I think it's insane to want them bigger.

                         Ever since I got these stupid things 
                         everyone treats me differently. I feel

                         I was saying?

                         Please, you have to help me. I think 
                         that if my breasts keep growing this 
                         way, boys will give me whatever I want.

                                     BEBE
                         No it's not, because if I grow up getting 
                         everything I want, having things made 
                         easy for me because I have hot knockers, 
                         then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame 
                         person. If I'm handed everything in 
                         life, then my chances of becoming a 
                         lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
 
                         
                                     DR. HALLIS
                         That may be true, but I'm afraid I just 
                         cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction 
                         surgery on an eight-year-old girl.

                         make them a little bigger, I think now 
                         might be the right time to size up, 
                         hm?

                         in the way of your friends. There are 
                         a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're

                         I know you think this set of boobs is 
                         important now, but those boobs will 
                         be replaced by another set of boobs. 
                         Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, 
                          you'll meet a pair of boobs that you 
                         want to marry. And those become the 
                         boobs that matter the most.

                         If you can just understand that, Stanley, 
                         you'll see that boobs hold no real power 
                         at all.

                         Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a 
                         very simple procedure.  What we do is 
                         make a small incision in the armpit 
                         where it won't be seen. Then we take 
                         this little plastic bag and gently place 
                         it in the chest where we fill it with 
                         salt water.

                         If we can help someone's self-esteem 
                         a little, then why not do it if they 
                         have to be a thousand dollars?
