                         All right, children, I have just been 
                         informed that since our school has been 
                         attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th 
                         time, we are going to change our school 
                         mascot.

                         Buh, Mr. Garrision, if we change our 
                         mascot, that means the eco-terrorists 
                         win!

                         That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists 
                         win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection 
                         sheet. Every student is supposed to 
                         check the box next to the mascot they 
                         like the most. And the most popular 
                         selection will be the school's new mascot.

                         from??  Go on, get outta here.

                         Now children, it's not that bad. There's 
                         plenty of great new mascots on the sheet 
                         to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, 
                         the Redskins, the Indians...
 
                                     WENDY
                         But aren't Indians and Redskins just 
                         as offensive?
 
                                     MR. GARRISON
                         No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care 
                         about people.

                         Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! 
                         We should secretly go around and tell 
                         all the students we can to not check 
                         any of the mascots on this election

                         better idea you guys. What we should 
                         do is we should secretly go around and 
                         tell all the students we can to not 
                         check any of the mascots on this election

                         Douche.

                         Butters, which is funnier? A stupid 
                         not-funny giant douche or a super funny

                         guess I'll have to go with giant douche, 
                         simply because the fact that it's a 
                         giant renders it useless, adding a parody 
                         slant to the satire.

                         I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna 
                         ride it.

                         I don't know if you can stay. We'll 
                         have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We 
                         don't normally allow outsiders. See, 
                         here we live in harmony with animals. 
                         They're not our pets but our fellow 
                         living beings. We work with the animals 
                         and try to live as they do.  We make 
                         friends with the animals. We coexist, 
                         and we... intermarry.  This is my wife, 
                         Janice.  The outside world looks down 
                         on a man marrying a llama, but our love 
                         knows no boundaries.

                         Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond 
                         his year. Here's your PETA shirt and

                         This is Debate 2004 with your host, 
                         Jim Lehrer.
 
                                     JIM LEHRER
                         Welcome to the cable-access televised 
                         debate between a giant douche  and a 
                         turd sandwich  We'll start with Giant 
                         Douche. Sir, some students and parents 
                         are reluctant to have a... giant douche 
                         represent them. What do you say to those 
                         people?
 
                                     GIANT DOUCHE
                         Jim, first of all I would like to thank 
                         you for monitoring this debate. And 
                         I would like to thank all of the students 
                         and their parents for coming.
 
                                     CARTMAN
                         Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! It's 
                         an obvious suck-up move.
 
                                     GIANT DOUCHE
                         But I would hope that those students 
                         and their parents who question my qualities 
                         would simply look at my opponent. He 
                         is a turd sandwich
 
                                     TURD SANDWICH
                          You're a turd sandwich.

                                     GIANT DOUCHE
                         ... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you 
                         are in fact, the turd sandwich.
 
                                     TURD SANDWICH
                          You're a turd sandwich.

                                     GIANT DOUCHE
                         ... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.

                                     TURD SANDWICH
                          You're a turd sandwich.

                                     JIM LEHRER
                         Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not 
                         to speak out of turn.
 
                                     TURD SANDWICH
                         I I'm sorry, Jim.

                                     GIANT DOUCHE
                         Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, 
                         I I forgot what I was saying.
 
                                     TURD SANDWICH
                         Ha. Wha-hat a douche.

                                     JIM LEHRER
                         All right, Turd Sandwich, this next 
                         question is for you. How should South 
                         Park Elementary enforce its laws of 
                         conduct for young athletes during sporting 
                         events.
 
                                     TURD SANDWICH
                          ... Uh you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't 
                         even know the answer to that question. 
                         If you ask him the same question, he 
                         would not answer it.  He would stand 
                         around and just babble on and on about 
                         nothing until he was finally saved by 
                         the buzzer sound. 
 
                                     JIM LEHRER
                         Your time is up, Turd.

                         stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to 
                         have taken a liking to you.  And she's

                         Stan, some PETA members are growing 
                         concerned that maybe you don't love 
                         animals.

                         you guys do.

                         should return home.

                         I think voting is great. I just didn't 
                         care this time because it was between 
                         a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

                         between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. 
                         Nearly every election since the beginning 
                         of time has been between some douche 
                         and some turd. They're the only people 
                         who suck up enough to make it that far 
                         in politics.
