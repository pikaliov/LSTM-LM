ACT I

EXT. BUSSTOP - DAY

Stan, Kyle and Kenny are waiting for the bus.

STAN
Dude, the bus will be here any minute
and Cartman didn't show up for school.

KYLE
Yeah, this is like the third day in
a row. I wonder what's wrong.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.

The boys all laugh.

KYLE
Yeah!

STAN
Hey, maybe we should ditch school
and go check on him.

But just then, the school bus pulls up.

MS. CRABTREE
COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!!!

STAN
We're not getting on, you fat, ugly
bitch.

MS. CRABTREE
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

STAN
I said 'We're not getting on, you
fat ugly bitch'.

MS. CRABTREE
Oh, alright then.

Ms. Crabtree closes the door and drives away.

KYLE
Woa, dude!!

STAN
I always wondered if that would work.

EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

The boys walk up to Cartman's door and knock. Cartman's mother
answers.

MS. CARTMAN
Hello, boys!

KYLE
Hi, we were wondering why fat ass --
I mean, Cartman -- hasn't been showing
up for school.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh, he's just been feeling under the
weather. Maybe you boys can cheer
him up. He's in the back yard.

The boys look at each other suspiciously.

STAN
In the back yard?

EXT. CARTMAN'S BACK YARD

It's a nice little yard. Cartman is sitting at a small,
rectangular table covered with a white tablecloth. Cartman
is at the head of the table, serving tea with an adorable
little plastic tea set.

Also seated at the table, are five of Cartman's stuffed
animals, one in each chair, and each with a little teacup
and saucer in front of them.

CARTMAN
Would you like some more tea, Polly
Prissy Pants?

CARTMAN
(Polly voice)
Yes, Eric, I would love some tea,
thank you.

CARTMAN
You're very welcome, Polly
Prissypants.

Unbeknownst to Cartman, the boys sneak in from behind some
bushes. They can't believe what they see.

CARTMAN
Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?

CARTMAN
(Frog voice)
Yes, please. Eric, why are you so
cool?

CARTMAN
Oh, I don't know, Clyde Frog, I just
am.

CARTMAN
(Polly voice)
You are so strong and smart, Eric.
Everybody likes you.

CARTMAN
Why thank you, Polly Prissypants,
how nice of you.

The boys stay hidden in the bushes.

STAN
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right
here.

KENNY
(Laughing)
Mph rm rmph rm rm!

KYLE
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!!

Stan grabs Kyle, stopping him.

STAN
No, dude... This looks really serious.
I think we better get help.

KYLE
Really?

Cartman pours tea for a large, stuffed Panda.

CARTMAN
(Panda voice)
Wow, Eric, you are the coolest guy
in the world. This is tremendous
tea!

CARTMAN
Why thank you, Peter Panda, It's a
distinctive Earl Grey.

CARTMAN
(Polly voice)
Eric is the best!

CARTMAN
(Frog voice)
Hooray for Eric!

CARTMAN
(Panda voice)
Eric Kicks ass!

EXT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Establishing.

INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The boys are gathered around the counselor's desk. Behind
them is a LARGE poster that reads 'FATHER & SON DAY IS
COMING'.

KYLE
Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong
with Cartman.

COUNSELOR
Oh, well there's a news flash.

STAN
No, no. We saw him having a tea party
with his stuffed animals.

KYLE
Yeah, he was doing their voices and
pouring tea for them.

COUNSELOR
Oh okay... Eric is obviously suffering
from some kind of emotional distress,
okay?

KYLE
What do you mean?

COUNSELOR
Have you boys noticed anything
recently that troubled Eric?

STAN
No.

*Note - the poster should be very visible in this shot.

COUNSELOR
Well, obviously something is bothering
him, okay?

Finally the Counselor looks up at the wall.

COUNSELOR
Oh, of course!

The counselor walks over, right in front of the poster, then
reaches past it and grabs a video camera.

COUNSELOR
My video camera! Boys, if you could
videotape Eric's behavior, then I
can study him psychologically and
find out what's wrong, okay?

STAN
Is that legal?

COUNSELOR
Oh, hell yes.

EXT. CARTMAN'S BACK YARD

Cartman is sitting at his cute little table.

CARTMAN
My goodness that's a lovely dress
you are wearing, Polly Prissypants.

CARTMAN
(Polly voice)
Oh, thank you, Eric, you are a perfect
gentleman. And you are smart and
cool.

CARTMAN
(Panda voice)
Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart
and cool. Everybody likes you very
much.

CARTMAN
That' nice, Peter Panda...

Meanwhile, the boys are in the distance, with the camcorder
on a tripod, trying hard not to laugh.

STAN
Dude, this is gonna be the funniest
tape ever made!

KYLE
How much do you think Mr. Mackey
needs?

STAN
I dunno, just keep rolling.

Cartman continues, unaware of the video camera.

CARTMAN
More tea, Rumper Tumpskin?

CARTMAN
(Tumpskin voice)
Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and
handsome.

CARTMAN
Thank you, Rumper Tumpskin. And what
do you think about me, Clyde Frog?

CARTMAN
(Frog voice)
I think you're a big, fat piece of
crap.

Cartman thinks for a minute.

CARTMAN
HEY!!!

EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The sun goes down in South Park. Passage of time.

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

Cartman and his mom are sitting at the dinner table.

Kitty walks up and meows.

CARTMAN
No, Kitty this is MY corned beef
cabbage.

KITTY
Meow.

CARTMAN
No, kitty!! That's a BAD KITTY!!!

Kitty hisses.

MS. CARTMAN
How is your beefy roast, snookums?

CARTMAN
Mom... Can I ask you a question?

MS. CARTMAN
Sure, hon.

CARTMAN
You know how my friend Stan has,
like, a DAD?

MS. CARTMAN
Uh-huh.

CARTMAN
And my friend Kyle has a DAD... And
my friend Kenny has a DAD?

MS. CARTMAN
Yes...

The two just sit there in silence for a LONG TIME.

MS. CARTMAN
Well what's your question, hon?

CARTMAN
(Pissed)
GODDAMMIT!! Do I have a dad?!?!

MS. CARTMAN
Oh...

CARTMAN
I wanna know where I came from.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh... Hmmm... Well, you see, Eric,
sometimes when a man and a woman are
attracted to each other, they want
to be... CLOSE to each other.

CARTMAN
Uh-huh...

MS. CARTMAN
And, sometimes, the man puts his Hoo-
Hoo Dilly in the woman's Cha-Cha.

Cartman tries to understand.

CARTMAN
So, WHO put his Hoo-Hoo Dilly in
your Cha-Cha?

Cartman's mother thinks.

MS. CARTMAN
Eric, the day I met your father, it
was like magic... It was a beautiful
autumn night, when the aspen trees
were turning; At the twelfth annual
drunken barn dance...

EXT. LARGE BARN - NIGHT - 8 YEARS AGO

A large barn with a banner that reads 'Twelfth Annual Drunken
Barn Dance'.

From inside, music, screaming, laughing and crashing can be
heard.

INT. LARGE BARN - NIGHT

Inside the barn is absolute chaos. People are singing,
dancing, fighting... but most of all, drinking.

Beer flows from huge steins, steel kegs, and glass bottles.
Everyone is absolutely bombed.

MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
I was young and naïve then...

Now we see the younger Ms. Cartman. She looks pretty much
the same except that her hair is longer. She is chugging a
yard of Beer.

MAN
Wow! I've never seen a woman drink
that much!! You're amazing, Ms.
Cartman!!

MS. CARTMAN
(totally drunk)
Oh, heck, I haven't even started
yet! I baked cookies... would anybody
like one?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I wouldn't mind gettin' a hold of
YOUR cookies, Ms. Cartman!

MS. CARTMAN
(Sexy)
Well... Go right ahead, Officer
Barbrady...

Barbrady leans into Ms. Cartman... Then grabs a cookie, bites
into it and walks away.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Mmm, that's a good cookie7!

Square Dancing MUSIC kicks in.

JIMBO
Come on everybody, let's do the
drunken barn dance!!

Ms. Cartman stumbles over to the dance floor.

MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
And then I saw him... He was the
most beautiful, charming piece of
ass I'd ever seen in South Park.

The camera settles on Jimbo for a moment... Was Jimbo
Cartman's dad?! No, just then, the crowd parts, and standing
there... Is a large, buff Native American Ute man. He and
Ms. Cartman stare at each other.

MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
His name was Chief Running Water.

As the camera ZOOMS IN on their faces, that gay 'Near/Far'
song from Titanic plays.

Ms. Cartman walks over to the Chief and starts to mosh with
him, vulgarly.

Finally, Ms. Cartman trips, falls down, gets back up, vomits,
and keeps dancing.

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - PRESENT DAY

Cartman is sitting, listening to the story.

MS. CARTMAN
I don't recall exactly how the rest
of the night went, but the next
morning, I was pregnant with you, my
little blueberry muffin.

CARTMAN
So where is Chief Running Water -- I
mean, DAD, now?

MS. CARTMAN
Oh, I never saw him after that. I
wasn't really that interested in
him.

Cartman sits there and thinks for a moment.

CARTMAN
That isn't a very romantic story,
mom!

Ms. Cartman goes back to eating.

MS. CARTMAN
I heard he still lives on the Ute
reservation just outside of town.

CARTMAN
Wow... To think all this time I'm
actually a naïve American.

Kitty walks up and meows.

CARTMAN
NO KITTY! That's a BAD KITTY!!!

EXT. STAN'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

Stan, Kyle and Kenny are on the couch watching television.
Grandpa is watching the T.V. too, but he has the remote
control.

ANGLE - TV

NARRATOR
Coming this Sunday... A major
television event that will blow you
away.

Explosions on the T.V. screen. The boys perk up.

NARRATOR
Terrance...

Zoom in on Terrance's face.

NARRATOR
Phillip...

Zoom in on Phillip's face.

NARRATOR
In the harrowing made for T.V. drama,
'Not Without My Anus'. Based on a
true story.

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, I have to go to Iraq
and find my kidnapped daughter!

PHILLIP
Then I'm going to go with you,
Terrance!

Phillip farts, they both laugh merrily.

NARRATOR
See Canada's hottest stars in the
HBC movie of the week.

STAN
Wow! Kick ass, dude! We have to
remember to tape Not Without My Anus
next week.

KYLE
Yeah, dude, it looks riveting.

STAN
C'mon grandpa?! We wanna watch
Terrance and Phillip!

GRANDPA
No, Billy, we're gonna watch the Bob
Saget show.

The boys MOAN.

ANGLE - TV

NARRATOR
And now back to America's Stupidest
Home Videos. Here's your host, Bob
Saget!!!

A clean shaven Bob Saget takes the stage.

BOB SAGET
Hey, I just flew into the studio,
boy are my arms tired.

The audience doesn't react, but Grandpa laughs.

BOB SAGET
Why didn't the skeleton cross the
road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts.

The audience again remains silent. Grandpa slaps his knee,
laughing. The boys just sit there.

BOB SAGET
Knock, Knock.

BOB SAGET
Bob.

BOB SAGET
Bob Saget.

The audience is stumped for a moment. Silence...

Suddenly they ERUPT with laughter. They roll around on the
floor, laughing uncontrollably.

So is grandpa. Stan can't believe it.

STAN
This guy sucks!

KYLE
Yeah, he's almost as bad as that guy
on Full House.

Suddenly, the doorbell rings. The boys walk over to answer
it.

When Stan opens the door, he finds Cartman dressed in all
Indian garb.

STAN
Cartman? What the hell are you doing
dressed up like an Indian with a
bear necklace?

CARTMAN
Naive American, Stan. And the bear
is very important to my people.

STAN
What?

Kyle and Kenny walk up behind Stan and check Cartman out.
Kenny immediately starts laughing uncontrollably.

CARTMAN
HEY! THE WHITE MAN HAS MOCKED MY
PEOPLE LONG ENOUGH! YOU KEEP YOUR
GODDAMNED MOUTH SHUT!!!
(Back to normal)
Stan, I need to borrow your bike to
ride over to the reservation.

STAN
What are you talking about, Cartman?

CARTMAN
My name isn't Eric Cartman. It's
Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow
your bike, or do I have to kick you
in the nuts and steal it?

STAN
Go ahead, dude.

Cartman leaves, closing the door behind him. The boys head
back to the couch.

KYLE
Man, Cartman's more screwed up than
I thought.

STAN
(holding out VHS tape)
Yeah, we better get this video tape
over to Mr. Mackey quick.

ANGLE - TV

BOB SAGET
Just a friendly reminder to all of
you out there, send us your stupidest
home videos! The grand prize this
month will be for ten thousand
dollars!!

GRANDPA
Ten thousand dollars!! Holy smokes!!

KYLE
Wow! I wish WE had a stupidest
homevideo!

Suddenly, the boys all seem to get the same idea. The camera
PANS along each kid's face as MUSIC kicks in. They look at
their tape with wide eyes.

EXT. UTE INDIAN RESERVATION - DAY

A NATIVE AMERICAN man walks up to a campfire, where several
other Utes are sitting.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
...And Bear cried to Eagle...

NATIVE AMERICAN
Running Water, there's some kid here
to see you.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
What kid?

NATIVE AMERICAN
He claims to be YOUR kid.

Just then, Cartman walks up, wearing all kinds of Indian
garb.

CARTMAN
Hi, dad!

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Who the hell are you?

CARTMAN
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you
put your Who-Who Dilly in her Cha-
Cha at the drunken barn dance.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Your mother?

CARTMAN
Liane Cartman.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
CARTMAN?!
(Laughing)
Oh, boy I was worried there for a
second!! Look, kid, I'm not your
father.

CARTMAN
But my mom said YOU were the guy she
was with.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Kid, I hate to break this to you,
but your mother is what we Native
Americans refer to as 'Bear with
wide canyon'.

CARTMAN
What do you mean?

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
She is 'Doe who cannot keep legs
together'.

CARTMAN
Huh?

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Your mom's a slut.

CARTMAN
HEY!

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Don't feel too bad, your mom was
just too drunk to remember what
happened. Let me tell you...

EXT. LARGE BARN - NIGHT

We are again outside the drunken barn dance.

INT. LARGE BARN - NIGHT

The younger Chief Running Water and Ms. Cartman laugh and
dance into the hay loft, a few yards away from the party.

Ms. Cartman giggles as she and the Chief fall into the hay,
embracing each other.

They look into each other's eyes for a beat...

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
We got tired of dancing, so we went
off to find a private spot. I knew
that she wanted me because she kept
saying romantic things.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh Chief, I want your hot manchowder.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Woa! Hello!

The two start going at it, as random townspeople dance and
vomit past them.

MS. CARTMAN
Wait, wait!!

Ms. Cartman sits up.

MS. CARTMAN
Who is THAT?!

Again the crowd parts, and this time we see a younger CHEF
standing in the crowd with a big afro.

Again, the Near/Far faggot song from Titanic plays as the
camera zooms in on Ms. Cartman's and Chef's faces.

MS. CARTMAN
Chief... Could you excuse me for a
minute?

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
Huh?

Ms. Cartman gets up and walks over to Chef.

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
You gotta be kidding me!!

MS. CARTMAN
Why, hello there... I don't think
I've seen you around before.

CHEF
Naw, I'm new in town.

MS. CARTMAN
Well, what's a nice, handsome,
(looking down)
BLACK... man like yourself doing in
a pit like South Park?

CHEF
I'm gonna open up my own restaurant
here!

MS. CARTMAN
My, how exciting! Would you... Care
to put your tongue in my mouth?

CHEF
Damn, baby, you cut right to the
chase, don't you.

MS. CARTMAN
I'm plastered.

Ms. Cartman grabs Chef and starts violently French kissing
him.

EXT. UTE INDIAN RESERVATION - PRESENT DAY

CARTMAN
His TONGUE?! CHEF?! Chef is my dad?!

CHIEF RUNNING WATER
He's the last person I saw with your
mom that night.

CARTMAN
Oh my God! I'm a black African
American!!

ACT II

EXT. BUSSTOP -DAY

Stan, Kyle and Kenny are hanging out at the busstop with a
little go-cart.

Kenny is pulling at the lawn-mower type engine, trying to
get it to start.

STAN
Come on, Kenny. Get the go-cart going.
I wanna ride it!!

KYLE
Did you send the videotape to
America's Stupidest Home Videos?

STAN
Yeah, I mailed it last night. What
sucks it that now we'll have to
actually watch that Bob Saget guy to
find out if we won.

KYLE
If we win, we can buy a NEW go-cart
that actually RUNS!

STAN
Shh! Here comes Cartman!

Cartman walks up, wearing all kinds of black hip hop street
garb and sporting a large afro.

CARTMAN
Ssup, homies?

STAN
Cartman?

CARTMAN
I was just down in the SPC kicking
it with some G's on the west side.

KYLE
You live on the EAST side, Cartman!

STAN
Dude, I thought you said you were
Native American.

CARTMAN
Oh, right. Like I'm some hippy Indian!
You know what I'm sayin'? Check you
later, I'm gonna go chill with my
dad.

Cartman walks off.

STAN
Dude, we should be videotaping THIS!
We could make ANOTHER ten thousand
dollars!

Just then, Kenny manages to get the go cart running. It takes
off at an amazing speed! Kenny is dragged behind it, holding
desperately onto the cord.

STAN AND KYLE
HOLD ON KENNY!!!

The go-cart runs wild up and down the street, though the
trees, Kenny being dragged and beaten to a bloody pulp.
Finally, after horrible bounces and bumps, the go-cart comes
to a stop.

Kenny manages to slowly sit up. He waves to Stan and Kyle.
He appears okay.

KENNY
Mrph mfrr mphr.

Until a train runs him over going seventy.

STAN
Oh my God!! They've killed Kenny!!

KYLE
YOU BASTARDS!!!

EXT. CHEF'S HOUSE - DAY

Cartman knocks on the door. Chef answers.

CHEF
Hello?

CARTMAN
Yo, pops.

Cartman is standing there with his afro.

CHEF
Boy, what the fudge are you doing?!

CARTMAN
You know, just laying down some rhymes
for my G-folk. You know what I'm
saying?

CHEF
Get in here!

CARTMAN
West side!

Chef grabs Cartman by the arm and yanks him into his house.

INT. CHEF'S HOUSE - DAY

CHEF
(Grabbing the afro)
Take off that wig!! Now what's gotten
into you?

CARTMAN
YOU'RE my dad, Chef! Chief Running
Water said you got together with my
mom at the drunken barn dance.

CHEF
What? No...
(Thinking to himself)
Uh... Did I?

CARTMAN
He said you kissed her with your
tongue.

CHEF
Oh! Oh, that's different! Women don't
get pregnant from tongue kissing,
children!

Cartman just stands there, blinking.

CARTMAN
(Looking sad)
So, you're not my dad?

CHEF
Of course not. Here,
(Helping Cartman onto
a stool)
You children sit down and let me
explain something to you about where
babies come from. Then you'll see
why I can't be your dad.

Music kicks in. Chef gets ready to sing.

CHEF
(Singing)
When a man loves a woman and a woman
loves a man (Actually, sometimes the
man doesn't love the woman, but he
acts like he does in order to get
some action.) The magic starts to
happen and the two take off their
clothes -- that's right. They caress
and touch each other until a part of
the man grows. Oooh, they roll around
and now things are really starting
to get hot. And the man say, "I love
you" and the woman says, "Hold on a
second, I gotta go to the bathroom."
So you wait and you wait and you
wait and you wait and... You wait
and you wait and you wait. You wait
and you're cooling down and she's
still going to the bathroom. Finally
she comes back and she says, "Baby
I'm getting hot." And that's when
you gotta jump her butt and pump her
full of...

Cartman is tremendously confused.

CARTMAN
WHAT?! So who the hell did that to
my mom at the drunken barn dance?!?!

Chef thinks.

CHEF
Oh, children, that was a long time
ago... But I'll tell you what I
remember...

EXT. LARGE BARN - NIGHT

Same old establishing shot. Loud noises and music inside.

INT. LARGE BARN - NIGHT

Chef and Ms. Cartman are rolling around in the hay, with
their tongues in each other's mouths. Ms. Cartman is on her
back, Chef is on top of her.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh, Chef! You're so strong!!

JIMBO
Hey everybody! Look who's here!! The
AFC champion Denver Broncos!!!

Sure enough the entire Denver Bronco team walks in.

BRONCOS
(Ad libbing)
Are we too late for the party? Where's
the beer. etc.

Ms. Cartman, still on top of Chef, turns to look at the Denver
Broncos.

Once again, the gay Near/Far Titanic song starts, this time
the camera ZOOMS in on Ms. Cartman's face and then ZOOMS in
on the entire 1991 Denver Broncos team.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh, Chef! OH, CHEF!!

Chef looks surprised.

CHEF
Damn woman, what's gotten into to
you?

MS. CARTMAN
WHOOPEE!!!

Suddenly, a hand emerges from beneath Ms. Cartman. Chef pulls
the hay away to reveal... MR. GARRISON!!

CHEF
Garrison!! What the hell are you
doing?!

Garrison looks at his hand.

MR. GARRISON
You're DRUNK, Mr. HAT!!

As Ms. Cartman looks at Garrison, that gay Near/Far song
from Titanic swells up yet again. ZOOM IN on Ms. Cartman's
and Garrison's faces.

CHEF
Ah, MAN!! I'm outta here!

MS. CARTMAN
Come on, Chef. Haven't you ever heard
of a manage' au three?

CHEF
Yeah, when two women are involved!

Chef gets up and leaves.

MR. GARRISON
Damn! Damn, Damn! Oh well, guess
It'll just have to be you and me,
Ms. Cartman.

They roll around in the hay.

INT. CHEF'S HOUSE - DAY

CHEF
And THAT'S who she was with last...
Mr. Garrison.

CARTMAN
No! NOOOO!!!! NO GOD NO!!!!!!

CARTMAN

'Why thank you Polly Prissypants,

The audience begins to laugh.

CARTMAN
(on the monitor/as
Polly)
'I think you are one of the coolest

are not fat at all!'

CARTMAN
Really? You don't think so?

CARTMAN

No you're not fat.

The audience goes apeshit. They are hysterical.

Stan and Kyle are laughing. Just then, Stan's mother and

STAN'S MOTHER
Oh, Stanly, we just heard the news

Huh? Oh, yeah.

STAN'S FATHER

INT. SOUTH PARK BAR - NIGHT

Garrison is drinking at the local bar with most of the
townspeople of South Park.

MR. GARRISON
Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat...

MR. HAT
Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan Mr.
Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat you need to admit you have a
drinking problem... Another Cosmo
please!

Just then, Cartman slams the door open. He's standing in the
doorway, eyes fixed on Garrison, looking pissed off.

CARTMAN
All this time... Why didn't you tell
me, father?

MR. GARRISON
What the hell are you talking about,
Eric?

CARTMAN
It was YOU all along!!

Garrison doesn't answer... Perhaps he IS Eric's father!

CARTMAN
YOU were with my mother the night of
the drunken barn dance!

JIMBO
Garrison?! That's impossible! He's
gay!

MR. GARRISON
I am NOT GAY!!

CARTMAN
Then you DID sleep with my mom?

MR. GARRISON
No!

JIMBO
He's gay!

Garrison thinks. He doesn't know what to say.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, okay! I admit it!! I might
have made love to your mother at the
Drunken Barn Dance!!

Cartman's face lights up.

MR. GARRISON
But Who here DIDN'T?!?!

The room is silent.

MR. GARRISON
Now come on! Honestly, who has NEVER
had sex with Mrs. Cartman?

Everybody looks to one another. Nobody speaks up... Not even
the preacher or Jesus.

MAN
I haven't!

MR. GARRISON
You don't count, halfie! You don't
have any legs!

MAN
Oh, yeah.

Cartman can't believe it.

MR. GARRISON
So you see, Eric. Anyone here could
be your father. I'm afraid you're
never going to know...

Cartman puts his head down.

JIMBO
Don't feel too bad there, kid. I
never knew who my father was either...
(Pause)
I mean, I DID know who he was, and,
well, we had great times together
and huntin' and fishin', but -- well,
hell, you know what I mean.

Cartman slowly walks out of the bar very sad violin music
begins to play.

Everyone looks like they genuinely feel bad for Eric.

MEPHESTO
Wait! Wait! I know a way to find
out!

CARTMAN
How?

MEPHESTO
At my laboratory! We can do DNA
genetic testing! I'll take some of
your blood, along with the blood of
everyone here and we can determine
who your father is!!

Cartman looks happy! Everybody else looks worried.

CARTMAN
REALLY! YOU CAN?!

MEPHESTO
Yes! Of course... I mean, that much
testing will cost a pretty penny...
but...

CARTMAN
How much?

MEPHESTO
Three thousand should cover it!

CARTMAN
I don't have three thousand dollars!

Everyone just turns around and starts drinking.

ACT III

EXT. BUSSTOP - DAY

STAN
Dude, I can't wait to win that ten
thousand dollars on America's
stupidest home videos! I'm gonna buy
the coolest go-cart ever!

KYLE
I'm gonna buy a walkman with MY half!

Cartman walks up, with his head down.

CARTMAN
(Very slow and sad)
Hey guys.

STAN
How's it going, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Oh... Fine. How are you guys?

The boys can't believe how mellow and normal Cartman is.

KYLE
Dude, what the hell is wrong with
you?

CARTMAN
Oh, nothing, it's just -- Nothing...

STAN
Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Well, I want to know who my dad is.
But to find out, they have to do
these DNA tests, and that costs three
thousand dollars. I don't have three
thousand dollars...

Stan and Kyle look at each other.

STAN
Wow, We're sorry your mom's a whore,
dude!

CARTMAN
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who
my father is. I just have to. Maybe
I could work at a sweat shop for a
while... Well, see you guys, I'm
gonna go play in my back yard for a
while...

Now Stan and Kyle look really guilty.

KYLE
Uh... Cartman, we know how we can
get you three thousand dollars.

CARTMAN
You do?

STAN
Yeah... We have a videotape that's
in the finals for America's Stupidest
Home Videos... And... And if we win,
we'll GIVE you three thousand of our
ten thousand dollar prize!

Applause.

ANGLE - VIDEO SCREEN

We see a lame video clip of a little dog.

BOB SAGET
(High voice)
Oh, I'm a little dog. I'm just a
little dog. Oh, oh!

The dog puts a hat on a bald guy's head.

BOB SAGET
(High voice)
Oh, I've got to put a hat on my
master's head, ha, ha!

Back in the studio, the audience is laughing wildly. CLOSE
UP on one woman in a 3/4 view laughing so hard, she's crying.

BOB SAGET
And now our second finalist... LITTLE
BOY HAS A TEA PARTY!!

Applause.

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

Cartman's eyes widen.

ANGLE - VIDEO SCREEN

The tape of Cartman comes up, he's pouring tea for Polly
Prissypants.

CARTMAN
(on the monitor)
'Why thank you Polly Prissypants,
you are my best friend.'

CARTMAN
(in Polly voice)
Oh thank you Eric.

The audience howls with laughter.

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

Cartman can't believe it.

BOB SAGET
Boy, it looks like THIS kid needs
some therapy!!

Cartman's eyes are HUGE his teeth are clenched.

ANGLE - VIDEO SCREEN

The audience erupts with laughter as little Eric pours tea
for his stuffed animals.

STAN
We're sure to win Cartman! Then you
get your DNA money!

CARTMAN
(Shaking violently)
I... AM... SO... PISSED... OFF...
RIGHT... NAAAAA!!!!

KYLE
They laughed hardest at our video!
We're gonna win! We're gonna win!!

INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

BOB SAGET
And finally, our third contestant,
'Young child gets hit by a train'!!

ANGLE - VIDEO SCREEN

The image comes up. Sure enough, it's Kenny, somebody
videotaped him trying to get the go-cart started.

BOB SAGET
(High voice)
Oh, I'm such a cute little kid.
Hmmm... I wonder if I can get this
go-cart started?

ANGLE - CARTMAN'S

The boys watch on in disbelief.

ANGLE - VIDEO SCREEN

We again see the horrific dragging of Kenny. He stops on the
train tracks, checks his head, then gets pummeled by the
train.

In the TV studio, the audience is laughing hardily.

STAN
Oh my God! They've videotaped killing
Kenny!!!

KYLE
YOU BASTARDS!!!

The audience is still laughing.

BOB SAGET

INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

BOB SAGET
Our other finalists will have to

time!

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

KYLE

enough for you to get your DNA tests!!

CARTMAN IS CATATONIC

CARTMAN
KILL... YOU GUYS... KILL YOU
GUUUYYYYSSSS!!!!!

ACT IV

EXT. MEPHESTO'S LAB

Establishing.

INT. MEPHESTO'S LAB

Cartman and his mother are in Mephesto's laboratory, along
with most of the men of South Park.

MEPHESTO
Alright, from everyone's accounts, I
have narrowed down Eric's possible
father to the people in this room...

As Mephesto lists off the names, we see their worried
expressions.

MEPHESTO
Officer Barbrady, Chef, Jimbo, Mr.
Garrison, Ned, Chief Running Water,
Gerald BROVLOFSKI, Myself, my friend
Kevin, or the 1989 Denver Broncos.

The little monkey guy looks worried.

The Broncos all look worried, too.

STAN
Wow, I always knew Cartman's mom was
a slut, but goddamn!

MEPHESTO
The test results are in this
envelope... Shall I open it?

MR. GARRISON
Yes! For God's sake get on with it!!

Mephesto opens the envelope and reads the paper inside. His
expression grows huge.

MEPHESTO
The father of Eric Cartman is INDEED
someone in this room!!

Everybody looks around nervously.

MEPHESTO
The father is...

A drum roll starts. The camera starts to focus on different
people in the room.

NARRATOR
Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is
it... Chief Running Water?!

Chief looks around nervously.

NARRATOR
Or is it... Chef?! Is it Mephesto?
Or that little monkey guy that follows
him around?

The little monkey guy raises his eyebrows.

NARRATOR
Or is it Mr. Garrison?!

JIMBO
No, he's gay!

MR. GARRISON
You go to hell! You go to hell and
you die!!

NARRATOR
Is it Jimbo?

JIMBO
Agh!

NARRATOR
Or is it Officer Barbrady?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Huh, where?

NARRATOR
Or could it be Ned.

NED
Could be.

NARRATOR
Or Mr. BROVLOFSKI?

KYLE
Dad! How could you?

NARRATOR
Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos?
THE ANSWER IS COMING ON AN ALL NEW
SOUTH PARK IN JUST FOUR WEEKS!!!

CARTMAN
What? Son of a bitch!

Episode 715


"IT'S CHRISTMAS IN CANADA"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Kyle's house, night. "Happy Chanukah" The Broflovski family
sings as Gerald lights the first candle on the Chanukah menorah]


THE BROFLOVSKIS
Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov


IKE
I gotta go tinkle.

KYLE
No Ike! Shh!

THE BROFLOVSKIS
Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim
vi-tov.

KYLE'S FATHER
We thank God for our blessings this
Chanukah. Our little family is so loving,
and perfect, and nothing will ever tear
us apart.  I'll get it.

MAN
Gerald Broflovski?

KYLE'S FATHER
Yes?

MAN
My name is Harry Gints and this is my
wife Elise. We're from Canada.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yes, I can tell.

HARRY
My wife and I had a child a few years
back, and, we weren't ready to have
a child, so we put him up for adoption.
We were told that you might be the-


ELISE
Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son!
Peter, it's Mommy.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, what the hell is going on?


KYLE'S FATHER
I I'm not sure.

[Moments later, both couples are at the dining room table]

HARRY
It was a tough time for us. It was a
tough time for all of Canada. The whole
country was devastated by the cola wars.
It just seemed we couldn't take care
of a baby.

ELISE
So we put him up for adoption. But as
the years passed, I, I just felt an
emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good
to see him.

KYLE'S FATHER
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and
Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think
it would be best for Ike if you didn't
come around again.

ELISE
I don't think you understand. We didn't
come to visit Peter, we came to take
him back.

KYLE'S FATHER
What?

HARRY
We want to take Peter home, to Canada.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Are you crazy?!

KYLE'S FATHER
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just
change your mind.

HARRY
Changing your mind is a Canadian custom
that we hold quite dear. And besides,
the new Canadian Prime Minister has
issued a decree that all adopted Canadians
must be returned home.

KYLE'S MOTHER
The new Canadian Prime Minister?

KYLE'S FATHER
Look, Ike is our son now!

HARRY
He doesn't belong here. He belongs in
Canada with his own kind.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I think you'd better leave.

HARRY
Please, don't make things any harder
for Peter.

KYLE'S FATHER
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just
blow in here and say you're gonna haul
him back to Canada, and we're being
hard on Peter?!

HARRY
We're prepared to go to court! We had
hoped it wouldn't come to that!

KYLE'S FATHER
Well you bet your ass it'll come to
that!

[Park County courtroom, day]

JUDGE
I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied.
The new Prime Minister of Canada has
authority this court cannot override.
By Canadian law I must award custody
of the child to his birth parents.


THE GINTSES
Yes!

ELISE
Yes!

KYLE'S MOTHER
No!

KYLE
Ike's not my little brother anymore?


KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, do something!

KYLE'S FATHER
There's nothing I can do.

[Kyle's house, day. Sheila cries as Gerald sends Ike off]

KYLE'S FATHER
Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye,
huh? You... remember all the things
we taught you.

KYLE
Ike, you'll always be my little brother,
okay?

HARRY
Come on, Peter, we should get going.


IKE
No!

ELISE
Peter, you must come with Mommy and
Daddy.

IKE
No no no no no!

HARRY
I have some chocolate.

IKE
Chocolate!

HARRY
We're going to take good care of him.


KYLE
You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to
this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif
he knew the situation, he might e-


KYLE'S FATHER
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister
of Canada would take... time and money
we don't have.

[Luau's Toys, night. It's dressed for Christmas. Stan, Cartman,
and Kenny look inside the shop through the window]

CARTMAN
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make
Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely
asking for that for Christmas.

STAN
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get
me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop
action.

KYLE
Guys.  Guys, I need your help.

STAN
Sure dude.

KYLE
It's been a week since Ike's been gone,
and every day my parents seem worse.
I have to try to go to Canada and speak
with the new Canadian Prime Minister,
but I can't do it alone.

CARTMAN
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's
Christmas!

STAN
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some
great Christmas adventure?

KYLE
Please, you guys, you don't understand.
My family is devastated. My mom just
walks around the house like a zombie,
and my dad can't stop crying.

CARTMAN
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle,
but I think this is what your family
gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.


STAN
Dude, Cartman.

CARTMAN
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having
a little revenge, that's all.

KYLE
I found the number for a really cheap
airline to Canada. If we go as soon
as possible, then-

STAN
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada.
Look, they're about to light the Christmas
tree. Maybe you can get your brother
back some other way.

CARTMAN
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it
were any other time of the year, I still
wouldn't help you.

[South Park City Hall, night. The town Christmas tree is up,
City Hall is decked out in Christmas decorations.]

CROWD
Three! Two! One!  Yaaaaay!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
As we celebrate this glorious time,
we can't forget those families who are
suffering. As many of you know, the
Broflovski family has recently had their
child torn away from them. As a community,
we must do all we can to ease their
pain. Are there any suggestions how
we might help?

MR. GARRISON
How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans?


MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest
we get rid of all the Mexicans, and
every Christmas we tell you "NO!"


MR. GARRISON
Rats!

CHEF
The Broflovskis need money to appeal
that case to the new Canadian Prime
Minister. What if this Christmas, instead
of buyin' presents, we all use that
money to give to the Broflovskis?


CARTMAN
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't
gonna buy us presents for Christmas!


LIANE
That's a great idea, Chef.

CARTMAN
What?

RANDY
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway?
This Christmas we can do somethin' that
really matters!

STAN
Dad, don't get carried away.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Then it's settled: This year we'll give
all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis,
in hopes that they may someday have
their child returned to them.

CARTMAN
No! No, this can't be happening!

[Kyle walks down the street still depressed. Cartman bounds in
before him]

CARTMAN
You fucking asshole!! This is all your
fault!!

KYLE
What?

CARTMAN
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give
money to your family instead of buying
Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews
ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!!


STAN
Whoa whoa, Cartman.

CARTMAN
It wasn't enough for you people to kill
Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas
too, huh?!

STAN
Cartman, calm down!

KYLE
Is that true?

STAN
It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.


CARTMAN
This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're
throwin' down. Right now.

KYLE
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something
we can do. We can go to Canada and see
the Prime Minister like I said. If we
can change his mind before Christmas,
then your parents won't have to give
my family money.

CARTMAN
You really think if we go to Canada
we might still get Christmas presents?


KYLE
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys,
we can do this.

STAN
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss
out on great Christmas adventures.


KYLE
We'll get back in time for a Christmas
adventure.

CARTMAN
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and
me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once
and for all.

MR. KIM
No business... Christmastime come anda
nobody wanna eata Chinese food. Looks
like I might as well close.  Oh boy!
Some business!  Finally!  Herro? Shitty
Wok, take ur orda prease!

KYLE
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We
were trying to reach City Airlines.


MR. KIM
Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease.  Herro,
Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take
ur orda prease?

KYLE
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon
as possible.

MR. KIM
Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty
far. Gonna cost ya a rot of money...
hmlet's she. How many people?

KYLE
Four.

MR. KIM
Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a rot
of money, that uh gonna be about ah
six thousand five hundred daura.

KYLE
How about fifty daura?

MR. KIM
Fifty daura?! You flighn to Canada cost
at reast three thousand daura!

KYLE
Fifty-five daura.

MR. KIM
Hey! Stop wasting my time wa fifty-five
daura! No way I take my plane to Canada
for less than a thousand daura!

KYLE
Okay. Sixty daura.

MR. KIM
Sixty-two daura.

KYLE
Okay.

MR. KIM
Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield,
yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.

KYLE
Got it.

MR. KIM
Hehehehe, never try to barter with
a Chinese man.

[Park County Airfield, night. A plane comes in for a landing
in the background as the boys approach the yellow Cessna]

CARTMAN
We have exactly fifty-two hours before
Christmas.  That means we have to be
back in twenty-eight hours to still
give our patents twenty-four hours to
buy us presents. Synchronize watches
on my mark. Mark.

MR. KIM
Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine.

CARTMAN
Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying
in that thing!

KENNY
(Me neither!)

KYLE
Why not?

KENNY
('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)

KYLE
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be
stupid.

CARTMAN
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will
stay here and watch the fort.

STAN
No, you're both coming. Do you care
about Christmas or not?

CARTMAN
Of course I care about Christmas- Doh,
Christ on a stick!

[Cessna 432G, inside]

CARTMAN
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken
in here!

MR. KIM
Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines.
This is your captain speaking. Rooking
about a two hour fright. I'll be turning
on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats
have seatbelts, this is the time you
will fasten them. Please sit back, relax,
and enjoy your Shitty fright.

KYLE
All right! We're going to Canada!

CARTMAN
Sweet.

[Cessna 432G, day. The flight has taken longer than two hours.
The boys are sleeping in their seats - and so is Mr. Kim. The
plane begins to hit turbulence and lose power]

MR. KIM
Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh!


STAN
What's going on??

MR. KIM
Herro from the cockpit, this is your
captain speaking. As you can see, it
appears that we are goin' down. Now
would be a good time to refrect on your
rife, and pray to whatever deity you
bereive in. Thank you for flying Shitty
Airlines. We know you have a choice
in airlines, and it looks like you made
the wrong one.

KYLE
Hey, where the hell are you going??


STAN
Do something, Kyle!

KYLE
I'm trying!

STAN
Look out!

KENNY
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!)

[Now begins the "Wizard of Oz" sequence. The boys look around
in wonder. A pair of legs is seen at a bench, but no head is
shown]

STAN
You guys, I don't think we're in America
anymore.

CANADIAN MAN
Eh-xcuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion?


KYLE
No.

CANADIAN MAN
Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone,
it's not an invasion!

KYLE
Hey! We're in Canada!

DOCTOR
Well of course you are! And Canada Friends
welcomes you!

CANADIANS
Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends
loves you!

We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!

SAILOR
We greet thee with pleasure, but one
question, if we may?

BUSINESSMAN
What brings you folks to Canada? Why
are you here today?

KYLE
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back
here to Canada? So, we want to talk
to the new Canadian Prime Minister about
getting him back?

CANADIANS
His brother is our quest. The question
is, is what? You must talk to the new
Prime Minister if you think his brother's
home's back there.

CARTMAN
Oh Jesus Christ.

SCOTT
Hey! What the hell is going on?!

CANADIANS
It's Scott! AAAAHHHH!

SCOTT
Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!


KYLE
Who's that?

DOCTOR
That's Scott! He's a dick!

SCOTT
A-ha! Americans! I should've known!
You think you're the police of the world!
You think you own Canada! Well, you
aren't welcome here! Get out now!


DOCTOR
Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these
boys alone!

SCOTT
This isn't over, you American scum!
I swear to God: you'll rue this day!!


MAN IN BARREL
God, what a dick!

KYLE
Look, we don't have a lot of time here,
okay? Can you just tell us where the
new Prime Minister is?

DOCTOR
The new Prime Minister doesn't live
in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa.


KYLE
So how do we get to Ottawa?

WRESTLER
Oh that's easy. You just have to follow
the road.

CARTMAN
Which road?!

FIREFIGHTER
This is Canada. We only have one road.


PRIEST
Follow the only road.

MAN
Follow the only road.

CANADIANS
To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow
the only road.

There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only
road.

Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.

ROAD WORKERS
And it's paved and wide and up to code.


STAN
All right dude, let's get the hell out
of here!

KYLE
Word!

CANADIANS
You're off to see the Prime Minister,
the Prime Minister of Canada!

DOCTOR
Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the
new Prime Minister! And remember to
watch out for Scott! He's a dick!


CANADIANS
Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.


[The Road, day.]

CARTMAN
Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents
still have time to buy us presents IF
we hurry.

MOUNTIE
Ahoy there, travelers.

KYLE
Who are you?

MOUNTIE
I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie.


SHEEP
Baaaah.

STAN
I thought mounties were supposed to
ride horses.

RICK
Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has
been cut and now we're forced to ride...


SHEEP
Baaaah.

CARTMAN
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush
to see the new Prime Minister.

RICK
You're going to see the new Prime Minister.
Oh, I would so like to meet him myself.
It's his strange new laws that took
our horses away. Perhaps I will go with
you.

KYLE
That's okay, we'd rather just go by
ourselves.

RICK
Follow me this way! We're going to see
the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister
of Canada!

SCOTT
Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!


[Further down the Road, Rick and the boys pass through another
town]

CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running
out of time!

RICK
All right boys, prepare yourselves.
We're about to enter... French Canada.


KYLE

RICK
Oh my! This certainly is a desolate

It reminds me of death and fear.

CARTMAN
How much further to Ottawa! Christmas

We must be very close now.

KYLE
God-damnit, we need to get to the new
Prime Minister! NOW!

STEVE
Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He
sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland.
Life just hasn't been the same since
he made sodomy illegal.

MIME
Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask
him to take his sodomy ban away.

KYLE
Can we just get going, please?

STEVE
Yeah, sure, except there's just one
problem.

STAN
What?

STEVE
You folks are goin' the wrong way.


STAN
What?? But I thought there was one road
in Canada.

STEVE
Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction
on it.

RICK
Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way.


MIME
Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland
right!

STAN
Oh no!

CARTMAN
How could you be so stupid!

KYLE
There's no way we can go all the way

RICK
It's okay, boys. The power is inside

there!

MIME
Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there.


RICK
Is it working?

CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle!
I told you if I missed Christmas we
were gonna throw down!  Well it's on!
We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW!


STEVE
Of course, we could always take my
boat, eh?

RICK
Oh yes! On the river we could travel
to Ottawa in no time!

KYLE
Well come on!

STEVE
Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister.


KYLE
Do you think we can still make it in
time?

CARTMAN
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.


[The Parliament building, dawn. Steve and the rest of the party
pull up to the small dock at one end of the grounds]

STEVE
Here we are at the Parliament buildin'.


MIME
Ze Prime Minister is inside.

CARTMAN
Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost
Christmas!

[The Parliament building, entrance. Kyle knocks on the heavy
wooden doors. A wooden panel opens up to reveal a window. A doorman
looks out through it]

DOORMAN
Yes?

KYLE
We need to see the new Prime Minister.


DOORMAN
Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister
isn't seeing anybody!

MIME
Oh well, zo much for zat.

STEVE
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best
wasn't good enough, eh?

KYLE
No. No!!

DOORMAN
Yes?

KYLE
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to
get here. He's the only person who can
help me.

DOORMAN
The Prime Minister isn't here. He's
in China on official business. So you
might as well go home. Good-bye!

KYLE
Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going
to get my brother back.

CARTMAN
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas
presents.

STAN
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas
adventure.

KENNY
(And I'm not gonna have a ...)

DOORMAN
Oh please! Please stop crying.

CARTMAN
I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.

DOORMAN
All right all right, I was lying. The
Prime Minister IS here.

KYLE
Really?

DOORMAN
Yes yes. Come in.

[The Parliament building, inside. The group walks down a long
hallway and approach a large sanctum with three fire pits. Two
small ones burn before and on each side of the huge one, which
sits at the center and has a holograph of the Prime Minister
hovering over it]

PRIME MINISTER
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What
do you guys want?

KYLE
Sir, you recently passed a new law
allowing parents who have given their
children up for adoption to change their
minds. My little brother was-

SCOTT
Not so fast!

KYLE
Ike!

IKE
Kyle!

SCOTT
Prime Minister, these are the child's
Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood
pumps through his veins! Would you send
him back to America with those world-hungry
scum?!

KYLE
Please, sir. I came because I don't
think Ike belongs here. Family isn't
about whose blood you have in you, family
is about the people who cared about
you and took care of you. We're not
the same blood, but I love my little
brother. We've taken care of him because
he needed us to, and that makes us more
family than anything.

PRIME MINISTER
That is a great speech, guy. But the
answer is no! All of my new laws will
stay in effect forever!

SCOTT
Haha, you lose, Americans!

RICK
Then, I suppose us mounties will never
get our horses.

MIME
And we won't get our wine.

STEVE
And we can't perform sodomy, eh?

KYLE
But why are you making such strange
laws??

PRIME MINISTER
I SAID GO!

KENNY
(Gah!)

STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

KYLE
You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell
is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime
Minister bases his decisions on hatred?
And, and takes away mounties' horses?
And French people's wine? What the
hell kind of Prime Minister are you,
anyway?!

PRIME MINISTER
I am the Prime Minister of Canada.
I can do whatever I-  Uh oh. Uh, don't
mind that guy hiding in the spider hole,
he's just my friend.

KYLE
What the hell??

RICK
Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!


SADDAM HUSSEIN
Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, baby. I'm
not him.

MIME
Zat explains everything! Za new Prime
Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again
trying to take over our beloved Canada
like he did before.

SOLDIER 1
Saddam Hussein?

SOLDIER 2
He was fooling us?

BUSINESSMAN
Get him!

SADDAM HUSSEIN
Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate.
Hey, relax!  Gah!

RICK
Wait a minute. This means all the Prime
Minister's new laws are null and void.
We can have our horses back!

MIME
And we can drink our wine.

STEVE
And I can sodomize me boys again

HARRY
Young man, you... must really care
for Peter to have come all this way.


ELISE
Perhaps we were wrong to try and take
Peter back. He doesn't belong here.
He belongs with his family.

HARRY
Peter, would you like to go back to
your home in Colorado?

STAN
What is that?

CARTMAN
It's Christmas. We officially missed
it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in
Canada.

KYLE
Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.


CARTMAN
Yeah! You got your brother back, but
I didn't get any presents!  And what
did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that
if we didn't make it back in time for
Christmas I was gonna whup your ass,
didn't I?!

KYLE
Dude, come on.

CARTMAN
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker!
That's right! You and me! Right now!
We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come
on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!


RICK
Ey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas
with us, Canada style!

[Ottawa, day. A Christmas parade goes by and the crowds cheer
and throw confetti. Saddam is paraded on his own float, with
huge candy canes around him]

CANADIANS
Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry
Christmas to the world!

Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam!

[Santa's sleigh passes by and the boys are hoisted into it]


Now Canada is free for you and you and me

It's the best Christmas presents we ever got

Canadian Christmas, it's the best! We drink and dance and show
our breasts!

Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!

STAN
Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a
Christmas adventure next year.

"ALL ABOUT THE MORMONS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. In Mr. Garrison's classroom the
kids enter and go for their desks]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats.
We have a new student joining us today
who has just moved here from Utah. I
want you all to say hi to Gary.

GARY
Hello everybody. It's relly great to
meet you all.

MR. GARRISON
Gary was state champion in wrestling
AND in tennis.  He also maintained a
4.0 grade point average at his old school
AND has been on two national commercials
for toothpaste.

GARY
I'm really excited to live in this town
and share all kinds of great experiences
with you, my new friends!

KYLE
Oh, dude, what a little asshole!

STAN
Yeah, screw that kid!

MR. GARRISON
All right, Gary, why don't you take
that empty seat and we'll get started
with the lesson?

GARY
Hey. My name's Gary.

CARTMAN
Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.

GARY
That's funny. You're cool, man.

MR. GARRISON
Okay now, who can tell me what year
the first astronauts landed on the moon?


GARY
Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!


MR. GARRISON
Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't
have a class full of retards anymore,
doesn't it, children?

[The playground. Gary is kicking a soccer ball around. The other
fourth grade boys approach and look. Shown are Craig, Butters,
Kyle, Clyde, Stan, Cartman, Token, Kevin, and another boy]


KYLE
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!


CARTMAN
Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him
place!

BUTTERS
He's a peckerface, that's what he is!


CARTMAN
Go kick his ass, Stan.

CLYDE
Yeah, go kick his ass.

STAN
Wull, maybe he won't fight.

CARTMAN
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.


KYLE
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe
that fuckin' smirk off his face!

CRAIG
Yeah, little bitch!

STAN
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass.


CARTMAN
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right,
I've got five bucks on the other kid.
Who wants in?

GARY
Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball
around with me?

STAN
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.


GARY
'Scuse me?

STAN
I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.


GARY
How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh,
I get it. I'm the new kid.  Yeah, I
guess maybe I deserve it.

STAN
Huh?

GARY
It's really tough being in a totally
new place, but I think all you guys
are really cool so... I understand if
there's initiation rites.

STAN
Dude, stop it.

BUTTERS
Let him have it, Stan!

STAN
Shut up, Butters!

GARY
The other kids are watching. Look, do
what you gotta do. I won't fight back.
I just hope that maybe afterwards we
can... try to be friends someday.


KYLE
What are they doing?

CARTMAN
They're just standing there, talking.


KYLE
What happened?

STAN
I'm...  going over to his house for
dinenr tonight.

TOKEN
What?! How did that happen?

STAN
He's a really nice kid.

CARTMAN
You were supposed to kick his ass, not
lick his butthole!

KYLE
You're having dinenr with his family?
What kind of family has a kid like that?


[Gary's house. His family is enjoying itself at the dinner table,
playing a board game, "LIVING", and laughing]

DAD
Okay, my turn.  Ooo, five!  One two

STAN
No.

DAD
Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments

JENNY
Oh yeah!

MARK
Woohoo! OOWW!

STAN
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?


GARY
You know... the book that Joseph Smith
found.

STAN
Who's Joseph Smith?

MARK
Only the most important person in the
world.

JENNY
You've never heard of him?

STAN
No!

GARY
Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.


THE OTHER KIDS
Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.


DAD
All right, you rascals. Gather round.
Joseph Smith lived in a little American
town in the early 1800s.

[A little American town in the early 1800s. A man rides by in
a small carriage pulled by one horse. In the distance, Joseph
Smith strolls into town]

SINGERS
Joseph Smith was called a prophet

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

He started the Mormon religion

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

BLACKSMITH
There goes that kooky Joseph Smith


CUSTOMER
You know, he claims he spoke with God
and Jesus.

WOMAN
Well, how do you know he didn't?

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Joseph Smith was called a prophet-

BUTLER
Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you
spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't
believe it.

SMITH
Well it's true. I did.

WIFE
Where?

SMITH
I was out in the woods, praying  I was
asking God if I should be a Protestant,
or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly
God and Jesus appeared before me.  And
they said I should start my own church,
because none of the others had it right.
And that's exactly how it happened.


BUTLER
You see? You believe it now?

WIFE
Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that
up?

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Many people believed Joseph

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

And that night he-ee saw an angel

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

SMITH
And please bless Mother and Father,
and please keep our bellies full of
yum-yums and luscious goodies.  AAAHH!
Oh my gosh!

ANGEL
I am Moroni. I am a Native American.


SMITH
A...  Native American?  But your skin
is white.

MORONI
Yes. Long ago all Native American were
white. We all came to America from Jerusalem.
And while we were here we were visited
by Christ.

SMITH
Jesus live here in America?

MORONI
Yes. Eventually, my people were all
killed by the other tribe of Israel,
and as punishment, God turned their
skin red. These are the Native Americans
you know today.

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

MORONI
There is an ancient book buried near
here, written on gold plates that account
my people's lives. Also buried with
the book are two seer stones, the Urim
and Thummim, which will allow you to
translate the writings. Find it, and
fulfill your destiny.

SMITH
Wooww...

SINGERS
Joseph Smith was called a prophet

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

[back to the present]

DAD
And we all know what happened then,
don't we?

KIDS
Yeah! I know!

STAN
What happened then?

MOM
Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done!


KIDS
Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right!
Rice Crispy squares!

DAD

DAD
Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really
nice meeting you, Stan.

MARK, JENNY
Bye Stan!

MOM
Great to meet you!

GARY
Bye!

[Stan's house, night. What a contrast. Randy watches TV on the
couch with beer in hand, Shelley watches it on the floor, Sharon
watches it from the dining table solving crossword puzzles. Stan
enters upon this desolate scene]

STAN
...Hello?

SHARON
Oh, hi Stan.

STAN
Hey Dad, how come you never told me
about Joseph Smith?

RANDY
Who?

SHELLEY
Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!


STAN
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.


SHARON
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually
speak to people.

STAN
That's not what the Harrisons said.


RANDY
Who are the Harrisons?

STAN
The new people that moved in down the
street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph
Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they
told him none of the religions were
right.

RANDY
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious
kooks?!

STAN
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean,
how come we never have a night where
we don't watch any TV and we just...
do stuff together and eat and drink?


RANDY
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday
Night Kegger.

STAN
But that's just you and your friends.


SHELLEY
I said shut up, turd!

STAN
Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng
Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't
even know what that is.

RANDY
All right, that does it!

SHARON
Where are you going?

RANDY
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr.
Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill
my son's head with wacko religious crap,
he's wrong!

SHARON
Randy, don't cause trouble.

RANDY
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta
put these cult people in their place
or else they never stop! I'm gonna go
kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This,
Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?


STAN
Yeah.

RANDY
Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass!


[The neighborhood, night. Randy walks down the street.]

RANDY
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my
son what to believe, will you?! We'll
see how you like my fist in your ass!


MR. HARRISON
Hello!

RANDY
Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?

MR. HARRISON
I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.

RANDY
Well, look, my kid was just over at
your house and he a-

GARY SR.
Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice
to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh
is here!

RANDY
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that


KAREN
Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so
nice to meet you!

RANDY
Well, thanks. Uh...

GARY SR
Karen just finished baking the most
amazing Rice Crispy squares.

KAREN
With chocolate frosting

GARY SR
Come on out of the cold. You've gotta
try one. Or six.

[The coffee table in the living room.]

GARY SR.
I cannot tell you how wonderful it is
to have you over.

KAREN
I hear you're a geologist. That is
so amazing.

RANDY
Look, uh, I actually came over because
I'm a little concerned about some of
the things you told my son.

GARY SR., KAREN
Uh huh?

RANDY
You know. About... God, and stuff.


GARY SR.
Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were
trying to convert him.

RANDY
Well, I-

GARY SR.
Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.

KAREN
We just moved here from Utah and we're
so used to everyone being Mormon that
we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants
to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be
furious!

RANDY
Well, no, no, I just-

GARY SR.
You just heard your son talking about
religious ideals that aren't your own
and you said "Who the heck do these
people think they are?!" I I'm really,
truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen
again.

RANDY
Y-you can call me... Randy.

KAREN
Randy, the last thing we want is for
people to think we're pushing our religion.
We know there are a lot of beliefs out
there and ours just works for us.


GARY SR.
To each his own, right?

RANDY
Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist,
I've never known any Mormons. I, don't
even know what you people believe. Who
was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he
believe that Native Americans are actually
white people from Jerusalem?

GARY SR.
Well, because they found ancient books
they had written on gold plates, right
where the angel Moroni said they would
be.

[The Early 1800s, day, a small town. People mill around]

SMITH
I found them! I found them!  You're
not gonne believe it, everybody! I found
them!

BUTLER
Found what?

SMITH
Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!


PEOPLE
What? What did he say? Are you crazy?


SMITH
Last night, a Native America angel told
me where I could find another testament
of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the
woods. I dug around all morning where
the angel had told me to look.

SMITH
Maybe there isn't anything out here.
Wait a tick!  What's this?  Wow...


SMITH
Inside the stone box, I found the magical
seer stones. Under that, I found four
gold plates written in strange writing
.

SMITH
This must be the Gospel that Jesus told
the Nephites!

SMITH
Well, they were the most amazing things
I'd ever gazed upon.

MAN
Well, so where are they?

SMITH
Where are what?

WOMAN
The gold plates and the seer stones.
Where are they?

SMITH
Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to
take them. You see, after I found the
plates, the angel Moroni appeared to
me again and said that I am not allowed
to show the plates, or the seer stones,
to anybody. Because first I must translate
what's written on the plates into English,
so you can all read it!

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

PEOPLE
Wow, amazing!

SINGERS
He found the stones and golden plates


Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Even though nobody else ever saw them

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

[The Marsh house. Sharon and Shelley are at their spots, Stan
sits on the couch, all three watch TV. Randy returns with a Book
of Mormon in hand]

STAN
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You
kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?

RANDY
Not exactly. We're uh, having their
family over for dinner tomorrow night.


STAN
See? That's what happened to me!

RANDY
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph
Smith found a new testament to the Bible
buried here in America?

SHARON
What are you talking about?

RANDY
Well it's just that... the Harrisons
are really nice people and... you should
see how loving and together their family
is. I, I think there's something to
that religion.

STAN
That's what they made me think, too!


RANDY
All right, that does it. From now on,
our family is Mormon!

[The neighborhood, day. In front of Kyle's house Kyle, Kenny
and Cartman are tossing a football around. Stan arrives. Cartman
catches the football and approaches Stan]

CARTMAN
Hey Stan, how was your date last night
with the new kid?

STAN
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family
and... Gary is actually really smart
and talented.

CARTMAN
Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.


KYLE
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?


STAN
What's the big deal? Can't I have other
friends? You guys should give Gary a
chance.

GARY
Hey Stan.

CARTMAN
Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend
now.

GARY
Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said
last night that you'd lost your wallet,
so I made you a new one.  I carved a
picture of John Elway into the leather
on the front.

STAN
Wow, you made this?

CARTMAN
Awww, look at them. Aren't they so
cute together?

GARY
Hey! My family's on their way over to
the fire station to donate blood. You
wanna come along?

STAN
Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to
uh...

GARY
Oh here comes my family now!

THE HARRISONS
Hey you guys!

KAREN
Look, we painted our faces!

MARK
I'm a lion.

JENNY
I'm an alien.

GARY SR.
Hey, just what the heck am I supposed
to be?

CARTMAN
Oh my God...

DAVE
You gonna come with us to the fire
station, Stan?

STAN
Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.

GARY SR.
Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out
with your friend Stan?

GARY
Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man,
I would miss you guys so much!

MARK
We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.

KAREN
Aw, we'll all see each other tonight
when we go to Stan's house for dinner.
Stay and play with your friend, Gary.


GARY SR.
Yeah. Have a good time, boys.

MARK
Let's go.  Our faces are painted.


KYLE
Wow!

GARY
So what do you guys wanna do?

CARTMAN
Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave
you two lovebirds alone. The three of
us have to go put in some volunteer
work at the homeless shelter.

GARY
Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.


CARTMAN
Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.

GARY
So hey, I heard your dad came over last
night and he and my dad talked about
Joseph Smith. That's great!

STAN
Yyeah. I had a question about that
Joseph Smith guy.

GARY
Sure.

STAN
What happened after he found the golden
plates buried in the ground?

GARY
Well, he kept them hidden from everyone
like he was told. And then he translated
what was written on the plates into
the Book of Mormon.

STAN
Yeah, but... how?

[Back to the 1800s, night. Joseph Smith and another man walk
up into the attic of a large building]

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

MAN
What's this all about, Mr. Smith?

SMITH
Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?


HARRIS
Well, sure I can.

SMITH
I have, in my possession, an ancient
book written on gold plates that tells
of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here,
in America.

HARRIS
In America?  Really? That sounds kind
of...

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

SMITH
It's true. And I'm going to translate
the plates and publish it into a book
for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I
know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris,
and I'm just gonna need a little bit
to pay for the publishing costs.

HARRIS
Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect
to translate it?

SMITH
With these.

HARRIS
Rocks?

SMITH
They're not rocks. They're seer stones,
given to me by an angel. With them,
God allowed me to translate the plates
into English. Watch. You take this quill
and paper and write down what I say.
Sit here.  I have the golden plates
here in this hat. I need to have them
somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual
light.

HARRIS
Really?

SMITH
Now, when I put the seer stones into
the hat, the ancient letter light up
and change into English, which I can
then read to you.

HARRIS
Wow!

SMITH
Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay.
Write this down. "And... so... it...
was... that... Christ... appeared before...
the... Nephites."

SINGERS
And that's how the Book of Mormon was
written

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.

RANDY
One two three four. "Pay one thousand
dollars property tax."  Isn't this great,
you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.


SHELLEY
I wanna watch TV.

RANDY
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons
now and we're having Family Home Evening!


STAN
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith
guy read the Book of Mormon out of a
hat?

RANDY
And?  Your turn, Sharon.

STAN
It's just that... the Book of Mormon
says a lot of strange stuff, like that
Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County,
Missouri.

RANDY
Yes.

STAN
But school taught me that the first
man and woman lived in Africa.

RANDY
Well you can't believe everything school
tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelley.
Oooo, that must be the Harrisons!


GARY
Hey everybody.

MARK
Wow, what a great house!

KAREN
You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice
to meet youuu!

JENNY
And you must be Stan's sister. Oh,
I think your brother's the greatest.


SHELLEY
My brother is a stupid turd.

GARY
Hey Stan.

STAN
Hey Gary.

RANDY
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.
You're here just in time. My son was
having a little problem with our new
religion.

STAN
Dad!

GARY SR.
Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because
he hasn't heard the best part about
the Joseph Smith story! The one that
proves he was for real!

THE HARRISONS
Yeah! Woohoo!

RANDY
Ooo, what's that?

GARY SR.
Well, you remember Martin Harris, the
rich man who wrote down what Joseph
Smith read out of the hat?

STAN
Yeah.

GARY SR.
See, after he was done, he took some
of the pages of what would become the
Book of Mormon home.

[Back to the 1800s, night, the large building]

SINGERS
Martin went home to his wife

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

HARRIS
A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into
a hat, a-and read to me what the golden
plates said. I wrote it all down and
we're gonna publish it into a book.


MRS. HARRIS
Martin, how do you know he isn't just
making stuff up and pretending he's
translating off golden plates?

SINGERS
Lucy Harris smart smart smart

Smart smart smart smart smart

HARRIS
Why would he make it up?

SINGERS
Martin Harris dumb dadumb-

LUCY
All right, here. I'm gonna hide these
pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating
off of golden plates, then he'll be
able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith
is making it all up, then the new translations
will be different from these.

HARRIS
Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.


SINGERS
Lucy Harris smart smart smart

Martin Harris dumb.

So Martin went on back to Smith

Said the pages had gone away

Smith got mad and told Martin

He needed to go pray

Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

HARRIS
Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the
pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready
to write it all down again if you translate
from the plates.

SMITH
I would love to, Martin, except, I just
had a vision. And the Lord said he's
very angry with me for letting you take
those pages.

HARRIS
He is??

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

SMITH
Yes. He is so mad that he will never
let me translate from the plate of Lehi
again. He's... we must now translate
from the plate of Nephi. So it will
be the same basic story, but written
a little differently.

HARRIS
Wow! If God got angry with you, then
you must be tellin' the truth.

SINGERS
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.


HARRIS
All right, Martin. Let's get to work!


[Back to the present, the Marsh house]

GARY SR.
And that's how it happened.

KIDS
Yeah! All right!

STAN
...Wait. Mormons actually know this
story and they still believe Joseph
Smith was a prophet?

GARY SR.
Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't
it?

STAN
No, it proves he DID make it all up.
Are you blind?

MARK
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.


STAN
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're
gonna say things that have been proven
wrong, like that the first man and woman
lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans
came from Jerusalem, then you'd better
have something to back it up. All you've
got are a bunch of stories about some
asswipe who read plates nobody ever
saw out of a hat, and then couldn't
do it again when the translatios were
hidden!

RANDY
Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.


STAN
I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!

SHELLEY
Me neither.

GARY
Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can
believe whatever you want!

GARY SR.
Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.


GARY
Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!

STAN
Oh, stop it!  That's another thing!
Why do you have to be so freakin' nice
all the time?! It isn't normal! You
just weasel people into your way of
thinking by acting like the happiest
family in the world and being so nice
to everyone that you just blindside
dumb people like my Dad!

RANDY
Yeah!

GARY SR.
Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon
fight?!

KIDS
Yeah! All right!

[The bus stop, next day. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wait for the
bus, Stan walks up somewhat somberly]

KYLE
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy,
Gary?

STAN
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.


CARTMAN
Oh no! You guys broke up?

STAN
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's
a douche. Now I just gotta find a way
to keep him away from me.

GARY
Hey Stan.

STAN
Oh brother.

CARTMAN
Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.

GARY
Listen, I just wanted to let you know
you don't have to worry about me tryin'
to be your friend anymore.

STAN
I don't?

GARY
Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in
crazy stories that make absolutely no
sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make
it all up, but I have a great life.
and a great family, and I have the Book
of Mormon to thank for that. The truth
is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made
it all up, because what the church teaches
now is loving your family, being nice
and helping people. And even though
people in this town might think that's
stupid, I still choose to believe in
it. All I ever did was try to be your
friend, Stan, but you're so high and
mighty you couldn't look past my religion
and just be my friend back. You've got
a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck
my balls.

CARTMAN
Damn, that kid is cool, huh?

"THE DEATH OF ERIC CARTMAN"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Stan's house, night. The boys are in the kitchen at the breakfast
table anticipating something. Next to Kenny is a stack of dishes]


STAN
Dude, where is she? We can't wait.


KYLE
God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.

CARTMAN
Stan, you said your mom was bringing
Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner!
Now is she or isn't she?!

SHARON
Hi boys.

STAN
Mom!

KYLE
She's here!

CARTMAN
She's got Colonel!

KYLE
I want some!

CARTMAN
Oh boy!

STAN
I want a breast!

CARTMAN
Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?


SHARON
Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can
help bring in the other groceries in
the car, then have your chicken.

THE BOYS
Awww!

STAN
But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!


SHARON
It won't take a minute.

CARTMAN
Come on guys. If we all help out, we
can do it super-fast.

STAN
All right.

KYLE
Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good.


STAN
Okay, this is everything, mom.

KYLE
All right, let's eat Colonel!

STAN
Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off
of every piece of chicken!

CARTMAN
Well, I saved you all the chicken part.


KYLE
The skin's the best part...

CARTMAN
Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna
sit on the toilet and read comic books.
See you at the bus stop tomorrow.


[The next morning the boys are waiting at the bus stop. Cartman
hasn't arrived]

STAN
I can't believe that fat asshole!

KYLE
You can't believe it?? He does this
shit all the time!

STAN
Well this time he's gone too far!

KENNY
(Yeah, fuck him!)

STAN
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?


KYLE
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!


STAN
Well it's not like we're nice to him.
I mean, we rip on him all the time!


KYLE
Yes, but he thrives on that.

STAN
All right. Then let's just ignore him.
From now on, let's not talk to him,
let's not even acknowledge him.

KENNY
(Fuck yeah!)

KYLE
That sounds great!

CARTMAN
Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I
was on the toilet all night from that
chicken. I thought I was gonna die.


KYLE
Do any of you guys have milk money I
can borrow?

STAN
I think I have extra.

CARTMAN
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's
a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews
have glassy eyes?

STAN
Here you go.

KYLE
Thanks.

CARTMAN
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have
glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny,
you see that chick on the news that
had her left titty cut off?  Kenny?
Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!
Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty
cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm
right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like
they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost
as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I can't
be dead.  I can't be dead!!

[The Cartman house, later. A plumber has come to visit, and he's
in the living room talking to Mrs. Cartman. Two other plumbers
are carrying away a box]

BLACK PLUMBER
All right, ma'am. We've got your new
toilet installed and we'll haul away
the old one away for ya.

LIANE
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just
don't know how to thank you.

BLACK PLUMBER
Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh.


LIANE
Ohoho, nhn.

[Cartman runs back home, but he stops in his tracks before he
reaches the front door. He sees the two men carrying the box
away and he fears the worst]

CARTMAN
No! No!!

FAT PLUMBER
What happened? Did they say?

THIN PLUMBER
Apparently there was so much chicken
skin in the system it just ruptured
the insides.

FAT PLUMBER
Aww, that's tragic.

CARTMAN
Oh my God, this can't be happening!
Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!
Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why???


[The Playground, recess]

JIMMY
Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman?

STAN
Cartman isn't our friend anymore.


KYLE
We're ignoring him.

TOKEN
Ignoring him? How come?

KYLE
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered
intolerant manipulating sociopath!


TOKEN
Oh yeah.

CRAIG
Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore
him with you?

BLOND
Yeah.

KEVIN
Me too.

OTHER BOYS
Yeah, screw him! Yeah.

CLYDE
I never realized ignoring him was an
option.

CARTMAN
Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You
guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello!
Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel
me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy,
it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel
your hair move?! That's me!  They don't
even know yet, that one of their best
friends is dead.  Dead and... still
wandering the earth a lost soul.

[Downtown, later. He wanders the streets of the town sobbing,
and no one turns to see what's wrong, until...]

WOMAN
What is that kid doing?

MAN
Ah I don't know, just ignore him.

[A blazing sunset over a bridge. Cartman's wails have gotten
deeper, more emotional]

[Night time, under a full moon, Cartman walks past a farm house.
Nearby are a scarecrow and a few pumpkins]

[Next day, Butter's house. He's shoveling snow off the sidewalk
to the front door]

BUTTERS
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu
lu, yuu've got some too-

CARTMAN
What did I do to deserve this?!  How
can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed
to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!


BUTTERS
Hey Eric!

CARTMAN
...What did you say?

BUTTERS
Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"

CARTMAN
Butters...  Butters! You can see me??


BUTTERS
Well, sure I can see you.

CARTMAN
Oh my God, and you can hear me??

BUTTERS
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be
able to hear you?

CARTMAN
Because, Butters, I'm... dead.

BUTTERS
HAAA!

CARTMAN
Butters! Butters, I just want to talk
to you!

BUTTERS
You died?? How??

CARTMAN
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it
blew out my insides.

BUTTERS
But if you're d-dead, how come I can
see you?

CARTMAN
I don't know, but you're the only one
who can.

BUTTERS
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

CARTMAN
Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need
your help!

[The Stotch kitchen. Linda is cleaning the sink and humming to
herself. She reaches down below the sink and opens the doors.
Butters is hiding there.]

LINDA
Butters, what on earth are you doing??


BUTTERS
Well I think... I'm like the kid in
that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!


LINDA
Dead people?

STEPHEN
Who's seeing dead people?

BUTTERS
Me! I saw a ghost!

STEPHEN
Now, Butters, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

BUTTERS
But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm
seein' you right now!

STEPHEN
Butters, these things happen all the
time. You've got a very active little
brain and your mind was just playing
tricks on you.

BUTTERS
Ruh, really?

STEPHEN
Yeess.

BUTTERS
So... so it was just... it was... just
my ima... magination then?

STEPHEN
That's right. There's no reason to be
afraid of things that aren't real. There's
plenty of real things to be scared of.
Like super-AIDS.

BUTTERS
Huh s-s-super-AIDS?

STEPHEN
That's right. A new form of AIDS which
is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon
of super-AIDS in your butt and you're
dead in three years.

BUTTERS
AAAH!  Oh Jesus.

STEPHEN
So now you feel better? Ghosts don't
exist and there's nothing to be afraid
of. Except the super-AIDS.

[Night time at Butters' house. The sky is clear, but lightning
bolts come out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear. Butters
is in his bed looking out at the stormy sky and can't get to
sleep.]

BUTTERS
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just
some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't
nothin' neither. J-just a muhouse.


CARTMAN
Butters...

BUTTERS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

CARTMAN
Butters, you have to help me!

BUTTERS
Go away! You aren't real!

CARTMAN
All right, Butters, you leave me no
choice.

BUTTERS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

STEPHEN
Butters, what is going on?!

BUTTERS
Well it's all...  Well he was...  Nothin'
I I just had a nightmare.

STEPHEN
Well you'd better stop having nightmares
or eles you're gonna be grounded!


BUTTERS
Y yes, yes sir.

CARTMAN
Butters.

BUTTERS
AH-

CARTMAN
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your
imagination! I'm dead and for some reason
you can see me!

BUTTERS
But I don't want to see you!

CARTMAN
Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one
who died! And for some reason, my spirit
is trapped here on Earth. I can't find
the passage to Heaven.

BUTTERS
Well... how do you know you're supposed
to go to Heaven?

CARTMAN
What do you mean?

BUTTERS
Well... how do you know you're not supposed
to go to... you know... Heck.

CARTMAN
I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm
not black, all right?!

BUTTERS
Oh.

CARTMAN
Now look: I thnk the reason my soul
is still here is because I need closure
with all my friends and loved one. I
can say my final goodbyes to them through
you.

BUTTERS
I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.


CARTMAN
This is your problem, Butters! Either
you help me, or I will haunt you for
the rest of your life!

BUTTERS
Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll
help you!

[Dawn, the next day. Butters and Cartman approach Cartman's house.
Liane is in the kitchen using a cookie cutter to cut out heart-shaped
cookies. Butters and Cartman enter the kitchen. Cartman is sobbing
into a small towel.]

BUTTERS
Mrs. Cartman?

LIANE
Yes?  Oh hi.

BUTTERS
This is going to seem very strange and,
and you may not believe me, but, well,
your son wanted me to tell you something.


LIANE
Oh, what is it?

CARTMAN
Tell her, tell her that I love her.


BUTTERS
He says, he love you.

LIANE
Oh, that's so nice.

CARTMAN
Tell her, tell her that I wish... I
wish I would have been a better son
sometimes!

BUTTERS
He wishes he would have been a better
son sometimes.

CARTMAN
It's just that, it's just that I got
so caught up with the rat race of life
tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes...
took my family for granted!

BUTTERS
He he got caught, he got caught up in
the rat race of, of taking things for
granted.

LIANE
Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you
too, poopiekins!

[The Broflovski house. Butters and Cartman approach it first
and ring the bell. Kyle comes to answer it]

BUTTERS
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's,
he's sorry for all the times he made
fun of you being a no-good stinking
Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness.
And and he wants you to just remember
the good times.

CARTMAN
Just the good times.

KYLE
There were no good times! And if he
really feels bad he can just tell me
himself!

CARTMAN
I can't! Don't you understand?!

BUTTERS
He can't! Don't you understand?!

CARTMAN
God forgave the Jews, you should be
able to forgive me!

BUTTERS
God forgave the Jews, you should be
able to forgive him!

CARTMAN
All right, come on, Butters, we gotta
go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin'
on him for bein' black.

BUTTERS
Uhh all right then.

[Kyle's living room. Stan and Kenny are playing a board game
on the living room floor. Kyle enters and approaches them]


STAN
Who was that?

KYLE
It was Cartman having Butters apologize
for him.

STAN
Dude, he did that to me this morning.


KENNY
(Me too.)

KYLE
He probably thinks if he apologizes
to everyone, we'll think he's changed
and let him back into our circle.


KENNY
(That guy would try anything)

STAN
Yeah, we know better than to think that.


[Butters and Cartman walk down a sidewalk, with Cartman checking
off more names on his notepad.]

CARTMAN
Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde,
and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.
All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters,
I'm sorry if I ever did anything to
hurt you.

BUTTERS
Aww, that's okay, Eric.

CARTMAN
Well, it's all done. My soul is at
peace. I think... I can go now.

BUTTERS
So I won't see you again?

CARTMAN
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each
person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine
rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.


BUTTERS
Wow.

CARTMAN
G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better
place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime!
Good-bye!!

BUTTERS
Yeh you're still here.

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?


BUTTERS
Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't
enough.

CARTMAN
What else do I have to do?!

BUTTERS
Well, well, you know, the preacher says
that before your soul can be at peace,
sometimes, you have to atone for something
bad you did.

CARTMAN
Atone?

BUTTERS
Did you ever do anything really bad?


CARTMAN
Not really...

[In Butters' bedroom, later]

CARTMAN
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's
fence and never told him about it.


BUTTERS
Broke fence...

CARTMAN
I took a crap in the principal's purse...
seven times. Then there was the time
I convinced a woman to have an abortion
so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza.
I pretended to be retarded and joined
the Special Olympics. I tried to have
all the Jew exterminated last spring.
Uuh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid
whose parents I had killed and then
made into chili which I fed to the kid.


BUTTERS
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to
atone for.

CARTMAN
Really?

BUTTERS
Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know
how you're gonna make up for all this.


CARTMAN
I know how.

[Moments later Cartman's hands are shown placing fruits inside
a basket, a pair os scissors cutting away at a thick transparent
plastic sheet, then the whole basket sealed with a bow. He and
Butters grin at the accomplishment. Behind them are some more
baskets roady to go. The first basket goes to Principal Victoria.
The second goes to Ms. Claridge. The third goes to the rabbi
at the synagogue. The congregation there is surprised. The fourth
goes to Scott Tenorman, who's sobbing at his parents' graves.
Butters and Cartman walk to their next desitnation with another
basket as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look on from across the street.
They deliver that basket to the abortion clinic. He records the
song below, with Butters and a recording engineer in the booth.
Next, he and Butters are repairing Mr. Anderson's fence. Cartman
hammers the new boards in place as Butters removes the damaged
boards. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny appear and watch. Kyle angrily
rejects what he's seeing and they walk away. Cartman and Butters
then go to the Special Olympics stadium and present a basket
to the coordinators. They leave a basket at Sally Struther's
door. They're then back in Butters' bedroom and Butters marks
off the last atonement.]

ERIC CARTMAN
I'm gonna make, make it right.

I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.

Make, make it right.

I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.

It feels so good to be making up

For all the things I've done wrong.

I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven

Wanted from me all along.

All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.

'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.

Not faking it, I'm making it right.

I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.

Make, make it right!

Make, make it right!

Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!


CARTMAN
Well, there's everything, Butters.
I've made everything right.

BUTTERS
Does this mean... you have to go now?


CARTMAN
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at
peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye
Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be
good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit,
what?! I've made everything right!


BUTTERS
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is
stuck here for a different reason.


CARTMAN
I want my eternal bliss! Do you think
this is funny, God?!  Do you think this
is funny,..?

BUTTERS
Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God!


STEPHEN
Butters! What have you done?!

BUTTERS
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!


LINDA
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should
ground him or call a doctor.

STEPHEN
No, I think you'd better call a doctor.
I'll ground him.

[Butters' house, later. Stephen holds Linda as the doctor on
house call leaves Butters' bedroom]

LINDA
What do you think, Doctor?

DOCTOR
Your son is suffering from severe dementia.
He claims that the ghost of a dead friend
talks to him. This is usually a sign
of schizophrenia brought on by some
tragic event in the child's past. I
think it's best that we take him to
the mental center and do some tests.


LINDA
Oh no.  NO!

[South Park Institute for Mental Health, day. In the operating
room, Butters is wheeled into play on a gurney, face up]

DOCTOR
All right, Butters, just try to relax.
Doin' just fine, Butters.  Just stay
perfectly still now, Butters.

BUTTERS
Lu lu lu, lu lu lu

DOCTOR
Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch
now, Butters.  Don't worry, Mr. Stotch.
Whatever traumatized yoru son in his
past, we'll find it.

[Butters' recovery room, later. The doctor and Butters' parents
are at bedside]

DOCTOR
Well, after fourteen hours of testing,
I can say Butters is definitely suffering
from aggravated repressied memory syndrome.
You see, Butters, when the brain wants
to cover something up, it makes up images
and sounds for you to hear.

BUTTERS
So... the ghost was in my head. The
whole time.

STEPHEN
Now do you believe us, Butters?

BUTTERS
Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.

DOCTOR
Good. We're making a lot of headway.
We'll do some more testing tomorrow.
All right, folks. Let's let Butters
get some rest.

LINDA
Goodnight, baby.

BUTTERS
Ahhh.

CARTMAN
Butters.

BUTTERS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

CARTMAN
Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get
you out of here.

BUTTERS
Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom
is really sore.

CARTMAN
I found the woman you need to talk to
for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert
in the paranormal. She can tell us what
to do!

BUTTERS
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my
head brought on by a traumatic event.


CARTMAN
She's gonna close soon! Come on!

BUTTERS
Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!


[The psychic's house. The doorbell rings. She's watching television,
but she gets up to answer the door. Cartman and Butters are there]


BUTTERS
Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?

PSYCHIC
Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and
tell me what it is you seek.

BUTTERS
Well, there's this ghost, see? Only
it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just
a delusion brought on by my trauma.
Well I'm supposed to heh, help him,
find out why his spirit is wanderin'
the Earth, even though I know that I'm
most likely just completely insane.


PSYCHIC
Well, many times, the reason that the
sould stays Earth-bound is because God
is intending to use that soul for a
divine purpose, to help prevent an impending
tragic event.

BUTTERS
Of course. That's it, Butters! We had
it wrong all the time!

PSYCHIC
But now, you shouldn't think you're
crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the
time.

BUTTERS
Really?

PSYCHIC
Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?


BUTTERS
Well, he's sittin' next to me right
now.

PSYCHIC
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

BUTTERS
Hey, I think she could see you too.
You really are a ghost.

CARTMAN
I told you, Butters.

ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news!

ANCHOR TOM
A tragic event is unfolding in South
Park. Three convicted murderers have
escaped from jail and are holding twelve
people at the Red Cross!

REPORTER CHRIS
Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested
when they ran inside the Red Cross behind
me, and threatened to kill all the workers
inside. The violent men are demanding
a helicopter and two hundred thousand
dollars cash.

CARTMAN
Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This
is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters.
This psychic boy and his ghost pal are
going to save the day!

[The Red Cross, later that night. A crowd has gathered and the
police try to control the crowd]

OFFICER
Stay back, people!

MAN
Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child
are in there!

DET. YATES
Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody
getting hurt.

LEAD CONVICT
You get us a helicopter and two hundred
thousand dollars or these people start
dyin', man!

[The Red Cross, outside. Butters and Cartman sneak past the police
barricade]

CARTMAN
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone,
first. Give me thirty seconds in there,
and then you go in and free the hostiages.


BUTTERS
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.


CARTMAN
Don't worry. I have a plan.

BUTTERS
Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.


CARTMAN
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already
dead.

DET. YATES
What the hell is that kid doing?

[The Red Cross, inside. The convicts look out through the Venetian
blinds]

BALD CONVICT
Somebody's comin' in!

CONVICT 2
It's just some little fat kid.

BALD CONVICT
What the hell is going on?

CONVICT 2
I have no idea.

CARTMAN
Yes, it's working!

LEAD CONVICT
This is really weird.

[The Red Cross, outside.]

REPORTER CHRIS
An incredible development here, Tom.
Two little boys have fearlessly gone
inside the Red Cross.

[Stan's house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch the news]

STAN
Cartman?

[The Red Cross, inside. Cartman swings two cowbells up and down.
Butters has left the door open]

BALD CONVICT
I'm so confused!

BUTTERS
Hurry. Go, go!

OFFICER 2
The hostages are clear!

DET. YATES
All right, move in!

CONVICT 2
The hostages are gone!

BALD CONVICT
What?!  Son of a bitch.

REPORTER CHRIS
Tom, an incredible story of courage.
Two little boys, armed only with the
weapon of confusion, managed to go in
and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems
to know who the boys are or where they
went off to, but they are heroes.


[The field across from the Red Cross. Cartman is about to take
his leave for the third time]

CARTMAN
Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the
day.

BUTTERS
Boy, we sure did.

CARTMAN
My spirit is at rest now. I can finally
go to everlasting peace, eternal rest,
and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters,
I think that, through this whole thing,
we've really become friends.

BUTTERS
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.

CARTMAN
We both, kind of needed each other and...
well... I'm gonna miss you.

BUTTERS
I'll miss you too, ghost pal.

CARTMAN
Goodbye Buttters. I must be going now.
I'll be looking down on you from time
to time. Have a long, fulfilling life,
Butters! Goodbyyye!

STAN
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what
you did.

CLYDE
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring
you now.

KYLE
We didn't think that by pretending you
didn't exist, you would really change,
but you really have.

STAN
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you
know. Talk to you tomorrow.

JIMMY
Yeah. S-see ya, Eric.

CARTMAN
You sonofabitch Butters!

BUTTERS
Huh?

CARTMAN
You told me I was a ghost!

BUTTERS
Huh but I thought you were one!

CARTMAN
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD
Butters, I'm gonna get you back for
this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK!


STEPHEN
Butters?!

BUTTERS
Oh Hamburgers.

Episode 204

"IKE'S WEE WEE"

Written by

Trey Parker



[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children. Let's take our seats.
This morning we're going to have a special
lecture by your school counselor, Mr.
Mackey

STAN
Booooo!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Nuh-now, who was that?  That is not
appropriate behavior, okay?

STAN
I'm sorry Mr. Mackey, mkay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh. That's okay, just don't let it happen
again.

KYLE
We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey,
mkay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.

CARTMAN
Okay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm
here to tell you about drugs and alcohol
and why they're bad, mkay? Uhso, first
of all, uh, smokin's bad.  You shouldn't
smoke. Anduh, alcohol is bad.  You shouldn't
drink alcohol. Anduh, as for drugs,
well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do
drugs. Okay, that about wraps up my
introduction, now uh, are there any
questions?  Yes, Stan?

STAN
Why do dogs have cold noses?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uuuuh, well I'm not sure.

STAN
Oooh.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first
on marijawana . Marijawana's bad, and
it also has a very distinct smell, mkay?
I'm gonna pass around just a little
tiny bit and I want you all to take
a smell , so you know when someone is
smoking marijawana near you. Mkay, just
take a smell, pass it on,  and when
it gets back up to me,  we'll finish
talking about it. In the meantime, I
want to get into alcohol a little, okay?
Uh, Alcohol is bad, Uh-if you drink
alcohol you

KYLE
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's
party this weekend?

STAN
Your little brother's having a party?
Why, is it his birthday?

KYLE
No, it's his bris.

CARTMAN
What the hell is a bris?

KYLE
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots
of food. And a band.

CARTMAN
Ah, kick ass! I wanna have a bris.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad.
Uh, ha- has that marijawana made it
back up here yet?  No-oh, okay. Let's
talk about LSD . Uh, children, LSD ih-is
bad. It's a drug made famous by John
Lennon and Paul McCartney

STAN
Hey, are we supposed to get your little
brother presents for a bris?

KYLE
Uuuh. I'm not sure.

STAN
Welluh dude, you'd better find out!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Boys, are you paying attention?

STAN
Sorry, Mr. Mackey, okay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana
made it around yet?  Uuuh, who-? Who
has the marijawana now?  Um mm mkay,
whoeh, whoever has the marijawana, just-
pass it up to the front roww, mkay?
Whoa oh.

[Principal Victoria's office. Somebody's gonna get it]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I am very disappointed in you, young
man. You should be ashamed of yourself.
What could have possessed you to be
so stupid?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We-hell, 'sorry' isn't going to cut
the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid
I'm going to have to suspend you from
school.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
You mean I'm fired?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, I guess that's a grown-up way
to put it, yes.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
But- but it was an honest error of judgment,
nkay? I- I really thought it was important
for the kids to know the smell of marijawana,
okay?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey,
but I'm afraid I have to let you go
for it. We searched each one of those
kids, but came up empty.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Buh-

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We had to let them go home, and one
of them now has half a lid of Jamaican
grass because of you!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Huh, how am I going to make ends meet?
M- mkay? Wha-what will I do for money??


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
There, there, now. Maybe this will all
blow over some day and we can give you
a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit
with that pink sawdust stuff.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
No-uho-uho-uho! I'm  not o-uho-uhokay!


[Bus stop. The kids leave the bus and Mrs. Crabtree peels away
screaming]

STAN
Man! That sucked, getting searched.


CARTMAN
Yeah, my ass is killing me.

KYLE
Why did they search us? That marijawana
never even made it to us.

CARTMAN
I wonder who took it

[Garrison's house. He's looking sleepily at Teletubbies]

A TELETUBBY
Bye.

VOICE-OVER
And now it's almost time for bye-bye.


[The boys are walking home when Chef drives up to them]

CHEF
Hello there, children!

BOYS
Hey, Chef.

KYLE
How's it going?

CHEF
Bad.

KYLE
Why bad?

CHEF
Children, I heard about what happened
at school today. Now, none of you took
that nasty marijuana, did you?

STAN
No, dude! We never even saw it!

CHEF
Okay. Because I just want to tell you
that DRUGS ARE BAD!

STAN
We know, we know, that's what everybody
says!

CHEF
Right. Bud do you know WHY they're bad?


KYLE
Because they're an addictive solution
to a greater problem, causing disease
of both body and mind, the consequences
far outweighing their supposed benefits.


CHEF
And do you have any idea what that means?


KYLE
No.

CARTMAN
I know. Drugs are bad because if you
do drugs, you're a hippie. And hippies
suck.

CHEF
Look, children. This is all I'm goin'
to say about drugs- stay away from them.
There's a time and place for everything,
and it's called, 'College.' Do you understand?


BOYS
Dude!

CHEF
Okay.

KYLE
Hey! Are you going to come to Ike's
bris this weekend?

CHEF
Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!


STAN
Whatta you mean?!

CHEF
Don't you boys know what a bris is?
They're going to circumcise him.

CARTMAN
Wo-what's that?

CHEF
Oh boy. Here we go again.  Children.
Uuuh. What's the one thing that's more
sacred to a man than anything else in
the world?

STAN
Haaa-a bicycle?

CARTMAN
Ham?

KYLE
No, not ham, you fat fuck!

CARTMAN
Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?

CHEF
Nono no, children, I'm talkin' about
the most important part of a man's body.


KYLE
Your heart?

STAN
Your eyes!

CHEF
Tsk.

KENNY
(Ooh, your penis!)

CHEF
That's right.

CARTMAN
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed
to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed
to call it a fireman.

CHEF
A fireman?

CARTMAN
That's the proper way of sayingn it,
or else you get a spanking.

CHEF
Goddammit, children! Why do I always
have to be the one to explain all this
stuff to you?  Ask your parents for
once!

KYLE
Hey, wait!

STAN
Dude, something tells me this bris thing
isn't good.

[Mr. Mackey is walking the streets of South Park, quite depressed.
A car pulls up and the driver honks twice. Mr. Mackey looks to
see who it is]

FEMALE PASSENGER
Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My
four-year old needs a fix. Yehahahahaha


DRIVER 1
Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and
Homer Simpson have in common: Dope!
Ha ha ha ha!

DRIVER 2
Heeey, Mackey!

DRIVER 3
Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross
the road?

DRIVER 3'S PASSENGER
Who do you think you are, you stupid
drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies
are all alike!

DRIVER 4
Won't you leave the guy alone?

DRIVER 5
Hey, Mackey! You gonna do some drugs?


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uuuuuugh!

BARTENDER
Yeh-I don't think I've seen you around
here wafore.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Naw uh-I jus', I had to get away, nkeh-ughuh.
I just lost my job.

BARTENDER
Oh that's weak, man. You know what you
need? You need a good stiff drink.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Ohuh uh I don't drink, mkay?

BARTENDER
Trust me, man! Yit'll make you feel
better.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Ughuh.  Drinkin's bad.

DEVIL
Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm
you down.

ANGEL
Yeah. Why the hell not? It's just a
beer. Don't be such a pussy, ookay?


BARTENDER
How do you feel?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Woh, about the same.

BARTENDER
Whuh, you just need something a little
stronger.

[The boys minus Stan are at the curb working on an ice sculpture
of South Park]

STAN
Kyle! You have to stop them!

KYLE
Stop who?

STAN
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I
found out what they're gonna do to Ike!


KYLE
What?

STAN
They're gonna chop off his weewee!


KYLE
Chop off his weewee?! Are you sure?!


STAN
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition!
It's called a circumstision!

CARTMAN
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off
weewees is not cool!

KYLE
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't
do that!

STAN
Dude, I asked five different people.
They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions.
Anduh, and they make it into a party
called a bris.

CARTMAN
Dude, yuh-eh-ehyou just don't - chop
off somebody's fireman.

KYLE
I won't believe it. I won't. I have
to ask my mom and dad!

[Mr. Mackey is walking towards his house]

COUNSELOR MACKEY


We are young, nkay?

# Heartache to heartache, we stand, 'kay? [checks the mail, then
toddles away]

No promises, no demands, han, han, 'kay?

# [tries to put the key in the lock, but fails at it]


Hoowhoa! Is this my house?

LANDLORD
Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey!
I changed the locks!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Why, Mr. Freeley?

MR. FREELEY
I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard
that you got fired from your job for
selling drugs to children!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
No no no! 'Kay? Ih, it wasn't like that.


MR. FREELEY
Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having
never taken drugs, I can say that they
have nothing to offer!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
But I've never taken drugs either.


MR. FREELEY
I've never taken drugs, and look at
me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my
property before I lose control and kill
you!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Huuhh?  OW, ukay?!

MR. FREELEY
Drug user! Druuug user!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, uh.

MR. FREELEY
Come back here, dammit!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Whoa, wait!

[Kyle's home. Decorations for the bris are going up]

Happy Bris Ike

KYLE'S MOTHER
Just a little higher.

KYLE
Mom, Dad!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh! Hi, bubbeleh. I'm so glad you're
here. You can help us decorate for the
party!

KYLE'S FATHER
Your mother's made gehakafakah.

CARTMAN
What the hell is 'gehakafakah?'

KYLE
Mom, Dad? What exactly is this party
for?!

KYLE'S MOTHER
To celebrate your little brother's passage
into life.

KYLE
Meaning what?

KYLE'S FATHER
Meaning we're going to circumcise him.


CARTMAN
They are gonna cut off his fireman.


KYLE'S MOTHER
It's Jewish tradition, bubbe.

KYLE'S FATHER
Normally, we'd do it right after the
baby is born. But we had to do it later
for Ike because he's a-

KYLE
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

KYLE'S FATHER
Oooh, now, what's gotten into him?!

BOTH PARENTS

CARTMAN
Aaaah-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run,

KENNY

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oygh, what is the matter with them?


KYLE
I can't believe my parents are cannibals!


STAN
What are you goin' to do, dude?

KYLE
I have to save my little brother! I
have to send him away until my parents
come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!


IKE
I'm right behound.

KYLE
Cover me for a while. I'll find a place
to hide him and come back.

CARTMAN
No way, dude! We're not staying alone
in your house with your weewee-choppin'
parents!

KYLE
Just give me thirty minutes. Come on,
Ike!

[A dark alley. Mackey is sleeping under some pages from a newspaper,
now that he has no job or home]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Hoh! I can't sleep, it's too cold, nkay?


BUM
Hey! Do you want somethin' to warm you
up?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh uh, no-I didn't know this dark alley

That's a little brother? I thought it

[Some woods near the town, daytime. Mr. Mackey is dazed and confused.
A Seinfeldesque riff plays]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, man, where am I?

TEEN 1
Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary
school, Mr. Mackey.

TEEN 2
Wow, dude.

COUNSELOR MACKEY

Pretty good, man. How are you?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked
out of town for doing drugs.

TEEN 1
Hey, us too!

TEEN 2
Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking
weed in the bathroom and got us suspended.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh. O fortune! Uh-how you mock me!


TEEN 1
Oh, cheer up, bro. All you need is some
clear liquid to get your head straight.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh. uh-boys, ele- LSD is bad.  Hmmm.

my mouth?  Yeah! Baby! The world is
so small.  I'm free! I'm free!

TEEN 2
Sweet, dude. Totally killer.

TEEN 1
That guy's totally tripping.

[Bus stop. Kyle has met the boys there and is working on a doll]


KYLE
There! What do you think?

CARTMAN
What the hell is that supposed to be?


KYLE
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents
think he's out with me right now, and
I have to bring him back for dinner.


STAN
Dude, I think your mom is going to notice
that isn't Ike.

KYLE
Not if I say he's sick and put him to
bed right away.

SYLVESTER
Grrrrrrr.  Rowrf! Grrr.

KYLE
No! Go away! Bad dog!

STAN
Dude, what did you make that doll out
of?

KYLE
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher
shop.

CARTMAN
Ey, is that why it stinks so bad?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Hii, booyys.

BOYS
Hi, Mr. Mackey.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Are you boys stayin' out of trou-ble?


BOYS
Yes.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay, I- I'm just gonna go over here
for a while.

KYLE
Anyway, I need you guys to help me so
that my parents don't realize Ike is
gone.  Knock it off, asshole!

CARTMAN
No way! I'm never going back to your
parents' house!

STAN
Come on, dude. If it was your little
brother, we'd help you.

CARTMAN
Eech.  Wait a minute! No you wouldn't!



TRAIN STATION


Welcome to

NEBRASKA

[The train comes to a stop. A door opens, and Ike is booted out]


IKE
Oh.  Oooh.

WOMAN
Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody
dropped off a perfectly good trashcan!


IKE
Yeah. No more walbolching!

[Kyle's house. The boys return from the bus stop]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Bubbe, where have you been?! Dinner's
been ready for five minutes!

KYLE
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with
Ike. He, he's been cranky.

KYLE'S MOTHER
How is my little jellybean?

KYLE
Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna

KYLE'S MOTHER
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a

KYLE
No Mommyuh he, he doesn't want you kissing

KYLE'S MOTHER
Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!

KYLE'S FATHER

KYLE
Put him down, you stupid dog!

KYLE'S MOTHER
My baby! Oh, God, the horror!

KYLE'S FATHER

KYLE'S MOTHER
OoooohhhhhhOOH-ho. Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh

KYLE'S FATHER

KYLE'S MOTHER
Aaagh aaaaaaa!  Oh, he's dead, he's
dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!

KYLE'S FATHER
There there, Shei-hla. There's nothing
we can do.

[The funeral. Ike's casket is being lowered into the plot. Present
at the funeral are the Marshes and the Broflovskis, Jimbo, Ned,
Barbrady, a piper, and the priest, dressed as a rebbe]

PRIEST
'Yea, usher us unto the Lord,' saith
some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes
and dust to dust

KYLE
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone
has the Canadian flag on it?

IKE MOISHA BROFLOVSKI

1996-1998

BORN A CANADIAN, DIED AN AMERICAN

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well, bubbe, there's something you have
to know. Ike wasn't really your brother-he
was adopted.

KYLE
What???

KYLE'S FATHER
He was not really a Broflovski, he was
Canadian. But we loved him all the same


KYLE
You mean to tell me that all this time
I've been trying to protect Ike from
having his fireman cut off, and he's
not even my real brother?!

KYLE'S MOTHER
What are you talking about?

KYLE
Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Whatwhatwhaaat?!

STAN
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that.
Now they're gonna find him and cut off
his penis!

CARTMAN
Fireman!

KYLE
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even
my responsibility.

KENNY
(Hey!)  (Hey, you guys! I'm dying-!)


STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastards!

PRIEST
Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

[somewhere in South Park, after the funeral. Jimbo and Ned pass
Mackey on the sidewalk. Mackey's eyes are bloodshot. Jimbo and
Mackey bump shoulders.]

JIMBO
Get outta the way, you damn hippie!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
I don't need to take you right-wing
authroritative bullshit!

JIMBO
What?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Aw, you're just like the government,
man! Trying to prosecute outta one side
of your mouth, okay, while supporting
guns outta the other, 'kay?

JIMBO
Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead
concert?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I can't, man. Jerry Berry's dead, nkay?


BLONDE
He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said;
that was coool!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Wha-oh. Thanks, man.

BLONDE
Would you like to come over to my place
and fingerpaint?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Sure, man. Fingerpaintin's cool, 'kay?


[Lincoln, Nebraska, train station. The Broflovskis get off the
train, Kyle first]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Now, where did you leave him, young
man?

KYLE
Aw, how the hell should I know?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, do something about your smartass
son!

KYLE'S FATHER
Uuuh. Mind your mother, smartass.


KYLE'S MOTHER
If we don't find him, so help me, you're
gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike,
love?

KYLE
All the time: "Look out for your little
brother, Kyle," "take care of your little
brother, Kyle," and he wasn't even really
my little brother.

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't
make him any less your brother.

KYLE
Yeah, right!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year
old Canadian boy.

CLERK
Two-year old Canadian boy, two-year
old Canadian boy- oh, I think they might
have one of those down at Hap's bar.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Come on!!


HAP'S

BAR

[The Broflovskis enter and scan the room, Ike is being used as
a base at one table. The camera pans back to him]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Ike!

IKE
Mamatoedoe.

BARKEEP
Hey, lady, that's my table post! You
can't have that!

[Mr. Mackey and the blonde are in bed admiring the fingerpainting
they have done all over the room, including the ceiling]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Wow, man. You know, it's like you go
through life thinking that you're an
individual, nkay? And then you realize
that you're more than that, 'kay. We're
all just one big individual, 'kay?


BLONDE
Let's get married and have a honeymoon
in India.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Nkay.

[Kyle's house. Home sweet cell]

KYLE'S FATHER
Now you march to your room, and you
think about what you've done!

KYLE'S MOTHER
But first apologize to your brother


KYLE
He's not my brother!

KYLE'S FATHER
Apologize to him!

KYLE
I'm sorry, Ike.

IKE
Uh oh, stufid.

[Somewhere in India, Mackey and the blonde are hiking. Elephants
bathe in the river below them]

BLONDE
Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I am one with the animals! And the
trees!

BLONDE
And I am one with you!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
At long last I have found

Mr. Mackey sits between Mr, T and Mr. Garrison]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh- What the hell is going on?!

JIMBO
Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking
you to rehab.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I don't want to go to rehab. I haven't
even done drugs in weeks!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We were wrong for shunning you, Mr.
Mackey, and we apologize. We should
have realized that you needed help.


MR. GARRISON
Yeah, now we're gonna make sure you
get the help you need.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I don't want help!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You're gonna thank us later.

[The big day is here. Guests are arriving]

BRIS

KYLE'S MOTHER
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for

IKE
Uh oh.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray

UNCLE MURRAY
Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?


KYLE'S MOTHER
He's been sent to his room for being
a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't
his brother, since he's adopted.


GUEST
Hi there!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Hello. Ddo I know you?

GUEST
Uhno, but I never miss a bris. Here,
I brought some dip.

STAN
Maybe you're being too hard on him,

No way! There's no real connection between

IKE
Cooka monster  two three four five.


KYLE
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through
getting in trouble for you!

IKE

BETTY FORD CLINIC

SOCIAL WORKER
You have to admit you have a problem
before anyone can help you.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
But I don't think I really have a problem.


SOCIAL WORKER
Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you
forgot all about your family.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I don't really have a family.

SOCIAL WORKER
And you lost your job.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
No, I lost my job before that.

SOCIAL WORKER
Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an
adult.

REHABILITATION

The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them.
There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's
called 'College!' Now, I want you to repeat after me- 'Drugs
Are Bad.'

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Drugs are baad.

SOCIAL WORKER
Drugs Are Bad.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uuh. Dru- drugs are baad.

[More guests arrive for Ike's bris. Ding-dong]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Hello, Dr. Schwartz. Thank you so much
for coming all this way to perform Ike's
bris.

DOCTOR
Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the
normal cutting device, but then I remembered
that Ike was Canadian, so I brought
the right one . Where is the little
rug rat?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Right over here.

DOCTOR
Come 'ere, you!

IKE
Oowwww!  Oh deh faminrr.

DOCTOR
Ike? Ike?

IKE
Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.

DOCTOR
There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.


KYLE
You stay away from my little brother!


DOCTOR
Bu-bu-but son I just-

KYLE
You aren't gonna cut off his weewee.
Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, what are you talking about?!


KYLE
And you! You should be ashaned of yourself!
Don't you understand that us males are
defined by our firemen?!

CARTMAN
Yes. The fireman is very magical. If
you rub his helmet, he spits in your
eyes.

DOCTOR
Kyle. A-a circumcision is a very common
thing for Ike to have. His father had
it, his grandfather had it. And  his
brother had it.

KYLE
No!  No, it isn't true!

DOCTOR
We're not going to cut it off! We're
just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger.


STAN
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a
bad idea!

CARTMAN
Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision,
too.

[The Betty Ford Clinic. Mr. Mackey and the social worker exit
the main building]

SOCIAL WORKER
Congratulations, Mr Mackey. You are
fully recovered.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I can't thank you enough for everything,
mkay? I feel like my old self again.


SOCIAL WORKER
Just one more thing.  Remember that
you caaan stay sober.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.
Mkay?

[Kyle's house. Everyone is gathered for the bris]

KYLE
It's okay, Ike. I'm here.

DOCTOR
And-a one and-a two and-a bris .

IKE
Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.  Cooka monsder.


KYLE
Ike, you're okay.

STAN
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't
all that bad.

KYLE
Yeah. You know, I've learned something
today. Family isn't about whose blood
you have, it's about who you care about.


STAN
Yeah.

KYLE
And that's why I feel like you guys
are more than just friends. You're my
family.  Except for Cartman.

STAN
Naturally.

CARTMAN
Eah, screw you guys! I don't- wanna
be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!


[Monday morning, Mr. Garrison's class]

MR. GARRISON
And so now, children, your school counselor
is back, to tell you first-hand about
his nasty experience with drugs and
alcohol.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay, kids? Uh- you shouldn't do drugs,
nkay-drugs are bad. You see, I was at
the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck;
why, I didn't even care about money.
I wasuh I was wasting my life.

CARTMAN
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris
tomorrow?

STAN
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman,
that's when I'm having mine.

CARTMAN
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Now boys, you need to listen up, onkay?
Wha- what I'm talkin' about might save
your life someday, mkay?

STAN
Uhkay, Mr. Mackey, umkay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Onkay.

KYLE
Mkay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Onkay.

CARTMAN
Okay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Hmkay.  Now, as I was sayin, uh- drugs
are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh,
uh if you do them, you're bad. Because
drugs are bad. Mkay? It's a bad thing
to do drugs, soduh so don't be bad.
By doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad.
Uh drugs are bad. Unkay?

"COW DAYS"

Written by

Trey Parker & David Goodman



[A game show. The audience is applauding a couple onstage. The
host and lady assitant stand near them]

HOST
Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to
the final round. Are you ready to play
for the grand prize?

TOM AND MARY
We're ready, Bob!

BOB
Any particular prize you're hoping for?


MARY
Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would
be fun, too!

TOM
Oh, anywhere would be great!

BOB
Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck.
Here we go. What is the thin flap of
skin that runs from the base of the
penis to the scrotum?

TOM
Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this.

MARY
The upper vascular hood.

BOB
I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Heheh, tell them what they've won.


ANNOUNCER
Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats,
because you're going to beautiful South
Park, Colorado!

MARY
Where?

ANNOUNCER
That's right, just in time for Cows
Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo
and carnival.  Every fall, South Park

BOB
Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.


TOM
What was second prize again?

MARY
Shit!

RODEO

[South Park, the rodeo ring. A rider falls from his horse as
it jumps some barrels.]

14th ANNUAL COWDAYS

[the carnival stage, on which the Mayor and her aides now stand]


THE MAYOR
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to
kick off the 14th Annual South Park
Cow Days!  As most of you know, Cow
Days is when we all get together to
celebrate and thank the noble, gentle
cows.  And now, the chairman of Cow
Days, Jimbo Kern!

JIMBO
This year is a very special Cow Days
because we are revealing our all-new
Cow Memorial!  Which will live forever
in South Park from this day forth. Release
the curtain!

MARY
This is the most ridiculous thing I've
ever seen!

TOM
Now, Mary, this is our only vacation
for years. We have to make the best
of it

MARY
Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We
just need to stay positive.

THE MAYOR
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy
the amazing rides and the wonderful
games!

[the carnival gets underway. People mill around]

TOSS-A-BALL OPERATOR
Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous
prizes.

KYLE
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win
Terrance and Phillip dolls.

STAN
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip
dolls? They look all crappy.

KYLE
Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.


OPERATOR
Sure they're real. They're even made
in Canada.

STAN
Really?

OPERATOR
Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance
and Phillip themselves.

CARTMAN
Wwow!

KYLE
Dude, that kicks ass!

CARTMAN
Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much
to play?

OPERATOR
Five dollars for three balls.

CARTMAN
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!

OPERATOR
Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just
gotta put one ball through Jennifer
Love Hewitt's mouth.

CARTMAN
That's easy!

OPERATOR
Okay, we've got a player!

CARTMAN
Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!

OPERATOR
Okay, son, you've still got two balls
to try and get through her yapper.


CARTMAN
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!

KYLE
You suck, Cartman!

CARTMAN
I'd like to see you do better!

KYLE
Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right
in the mouth!

OPERATOR
It's gotta go through her mouth

KYLE
But ih-

OPERATOR
Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more
dollars.

KYLE
Here, give me some money, Cartman!
Lend me money, fat boy!

CARTMAN
I only have three dollars left, asshole!


KYLE
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more
money from my mom.

JIMBO
Okay, everybody! It's time for the
Running of the Cows!

KYLE
Mom, give me some money!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This
is very dangerous!

KYLE
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and
Phlllip dolls.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, get back into the carnival this
instant! You can't be out in the street!


KYLE
I will if you give me money!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Okay, here!

CARTMAN
Sweet.

[Back on stage, Jimbo has some more things to tell the guests]


JIMBO
Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down.
Now I know you're all anxious to get
to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let
me remind you: those brave souls who
have decided to run against the cows
through town do so at their own risk.
I don't think I have to remind you that
three people died in last year's Running
of the Cows.  With that said, let's
rock and roll!  Everybody ready to run?
Release the cows!  They're loose!


COWS
Mooooo?!

[The townfolk scream wildly while the cows remain in the corral
and moo some more.]

NED
Ow.

[One cow timidly leaves the corral. A townsman looks back as
he runs, and finds himself impaled on the lower half of a shattered
phone pole]

JIMBO
Yeehaw!

[A red heifer chews on some grass just outside the corral. A
man comes and tries to provoke a grazing cow, but the cow ignores
him. The man shakes his ass at the cow, then runs away screaming]


[the carnival. A Chamber of Farts stands near a Ferris wheel.
Its entrance consists of a huge lavender ass with doors through
which the cars enter]

KYLE
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That
means we get nine balls to throw.


CARTMAN
I only need one, dude. I only need one.


OPERATOR
Come one, come all. Get in line now,
for the Chamber of Farts.

STAN
What's that?

OPERATOR
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?


CARTMAN
How much is it?

OPERATOR
Just three tickets, boys.  Dare you
enter the Chamber of Farts?

KYLE
Is it like a- haunted house or something?


OPERATOR
Sure. It's veery scary.

CARTMAN
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar,
so three tickets is like two twnety-five.


KYLE
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the
Terrance and Phillip dolls.

CARTMAN
Oh come on, you guys. We still have
plenty of money left over.

KYLE
You'd better be right, dude.

CARTMAN
I'm right!

OPERATOR
Keep your hands in at all times.

KYLE
Okay.

[they go in. They pass through a cemetery with asses everywhere.
A man has his pants down just enough for his ass to poke through,
a dog next to him has its tail up, there are flying asses about,
and some volcanos poke through the ground. All are farting. The
car stops]

OPERATOR
So, the Chamber of Farts has another
victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't
any ghouls here, only FARTS!

CARTMAN
Eh! God-damnit!

STAN
What the hell was that?

OPERATOR
Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!  All
right, boys. Ride's over.

KYLE
That was the dumbest ride I've ever
seen!

STAN
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival
company are you?!

CARTMAN
I don't know what you guys are talking
about! That scared the crap out of me!


KYLE
That was a waste of money, Cartman!


OPERATOR
Hey, if you guys want a great ride,
get in this line. It's only seven tickets.


KYLE
We can't. We're saving our money for
the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's
mouth game.

CARTMAN
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye?
We have plenty of money.  Come on, you
guys! It'll be sweet!

[THE COW MEMORIAL, 12
59 p.m. A cow comes to look at the statue,
and the clock strikes 1 p.m. The statue
moos. The cow looks around, then moos.
Two more cows arrive. Back in the line,
the boys near the front of it]

KYLE
This ride better be good!

STAN
Yeah, this line is way too long!

CARTMAN
I think we're almost to the end.

KYLE
We'd better be. We've been in line for
almost an hour!

STAN
Here we go.

KYLE
Finally!

LINE RIDE OPERATOR
Did ya enjoy the ride?

STAN
What ride?

KYLE
Yeah.

LINE RIDE OPERATOR
This was the Line Ride, a real live
simulator of a long line.

KYLE
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!

LINE RIDE OPERATOR
That's five tickets, thank you very
much.  Come see us again soon.

STAN
My ass we will!

KYLE
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion,
but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey
balls!

STAN
Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.


PHOTO SELLER
Would you like to buy a photo of you
boys enjoying the Line Ride?

CARTMAN
How much?

PHOTO SELLER
Just three dollars.

CARTMAN
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.


KYLE
You dumbass, Cartman!

CARTMAN
What? This is cool.

KYLE
No, it's not cool!

CARTMAN
It is, too!

OPERATOR
Can I help you boys.

STAN
We're gonna try to win those Terrance
and Phillip dolls again.

OPERATOR
O-kay, five dollars for three balls.


KYLE
How much do we have left, Cartman?
How much do we have left, Cartman?!


CARTMAN
Aah, three dollars.

KYLE
What?! You said we had plenty of money,
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Yeah, but I didn't take into account
the fact that I suck at math.

KYLE
You son of a bitch! Aaargh! [lunges
at Cartman, and they fall to the ground,
wrestling.

CARTMAN
Ey! Seriously!

[A view of the carnival. After a while the boys calm down and
stand up again]

KYLE
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't
have any money left to win the Terrance
and Phillip dolls!

CARTMAN
Well, I'm sorry!

KYLE
Well, sorry's not good enough! What
are you gonna do about it?

CARTMAN
Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps
on him!

KENNY
(What? These?)

STAN
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three
balls?

OPERATOR
Sure, as long as they're good.

KYLE
Give him your food stamps, Kenny!

KENNY
(Nuh uh)

KYLE
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!


KENNY
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps!
How am I going to eat without all these
food stamps?)

CARTMAN
Damnn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp
hog! Share with the rest of your friends!


KYLE
Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right
on target.

OPERATOR
Sorry, kid. Try again.

KYLE
That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!


OPERATOR
Uhwhat are you doing?

KYLE
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This
game is rigged!

OPERATOR
Shenanigans?

OFFICER BARBRADY
What's all the hoo-ha?

KYLE
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans
on this carnival operator.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Why?

KYLE
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger
than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!


OFFICER BARBRADY
If that is true, then your declaration
of Shenanigans is just.  What do you
have to say, carnival operator?

OPERATOR
Look, the kid was really close. He still
has another ball left. Leh let's try
again, son.  Here you go.  There, you
see? We have a winner!

KYLE
It worked!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Young man, you can't just go declaring
Shenanigans on innocent people! That's
how wars get started!

STAN
Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Barbrady!

STAN
Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?

OFFICER BARBRADY
You said Buttbaby.

CARTMAN
Sweet.

OPERATOR
Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick
between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and
the Bon Jovi Toothpick.

KYLE
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip
dolls up there.

OPERATOR
Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times
to earn those.

KYLE
What?!

OPERATOR
You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then
you can trade them in for the Terrance
and Phillip dolls.

KYLE
You dirty son of a bitch, you never
told us that we had to win-

OPERATOR
Step on up, just five dollars to play!


KYLE
Damnit, I have to have those dolls!


STAN
This is hopeless. We're never gonna
have enough money to win.

KYLE
Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding
contest. Cartman could ride a bull,
and try to win $5000.  Think about it,
dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls.
That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win
enough to get the dolls!

CARTMAN
What the hell makes you think Cartman
rides a bull?

KYLE
Because you spent all of our money
on those stupid rides, fatass! Now,
either you're getting on a bull or I'm
gonna break your fuckin' head open!


CARTMAN
O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.

KYLE
All right! Now, come on! We have to
practice!

STAN
He really wants those dolls.

CARTMAN
I guess, damn!

[Tom and Mary have just exited the Chamber of Farts on car 11]


MARY
That ride wasn't very good.

TOM
Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try
to have a good time.

MARY
You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll
try and have a good time.

[THE COW MEMORIAL. THE CLOCK NOW READS 1
59 p.m., and seven cows stand before
the memorial. Two o'clock strikes, and
the statue moos twice. The cows answer
with two moos of their own. More cows
arrive]

[the town bar]

STAN
Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna
help you practice for the real thing,
Cartman.

CARTMAN
Hey, this is sweet.

KYLE
You've gotta try and stay on for ten
seconds. Okay, Cartman?

CARTMAN
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.


STAN
We'll start on the slowest setting and
work our way up. Ready? Go.

CARTMAN
Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!

STAN
How long was that?

KYLE
That wasn't quite ten seconds.

STAN
Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman.
You have to do better than that.

CARTMAN
You guys, eh seriously, my back!

KYLE
Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!


CARTMAN
Seriously. Help.  Screw you guys. Hate
you guys.

KYLE
What'd you say, Cartman??

CARTMAN
I hate you guys!

KYLE
I think he said he wants to practice
on a real bull.

CARTMAN
Hate you guys.

[The cows are now pushing the memorial across open fields. It
now reads 3 p.m.]

[the boys stand next to a rancher who has offered his bull for
Cartman to practice on]

RANCHER
Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't
much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's
all I got.

KYLE
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has
to get some practice with a real bull.


RANCHER
Well, have fun, boys.

KYLE
Okay, Cartman. You ready?

CARTMAN
Nnoo.

KYLE
Open the gate!

CARTMAN
All right, get down. This is my kind
of bullride.

KYLE
That bull sucks! He's not even bucking
or anything!

CARTMAN
Yeah, this is sweet!

STAN
What are you going to do?

KYLE
Get the bull in the balls with a smowball.


STAN
Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea.

CARTMAN
Eeyy!

KYLE
That's better.

STAN
Hold on, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude,
stop this crazy thing!  Mother f-


KYLE
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying
on long enough!

STAN
Come on, Cartman.

KENNY
(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)


KYLE
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!
Get up!  Get UP!

STAN
You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?


KYLE
Dude, I think we broke him.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, waiting area]

DR. DOCTOR
Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend
has suffered head trauma.

STAN
What's the matter with him.

DR. DOCTOR
Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese
prostitute named Ming Li.

KYLE
Oh.

STAN
But can he still ride a bull?

DR. DOCTOR
What?

KYLE
We need him to win a bullriding contest
so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Can he still do it?

DR. DOCTOR
No, boys! You need to take him home
and let him get plenty of sleep.


KYLE
Damn it!

STAN
Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?


CARTMAN
Boinsure li bonsure.

STAN
What?!

CARTMAN

STAN
Oh, he's fine, dude.

KYLE
You think?

CARTMAN

STAN
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to
the rodeo.

[The Running of the Cows is ended and Jimbo is onstage.]

JIMBO
All right, damn it! We're not going
to stand for this! Now, whoever stole
our golden cow memorial, we're gonna
find you and kill you!  Aall right,
uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred
cow, just please return 'im, and there'll
be no quesitons asked.  Wait a minute.
You folks from out of town. You're the
only ones with a reason to take our
beloved cow memorial!

MARY
Where are we going to put a 60-foot
tall statue of a cow?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that
downtown, tourists.

MARY
Oh my God!

[At the carnival, the boys have returned with Cartman.]

STAN
How's he doing?

KYLE
He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.


CARTMAN
Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar

Do you think he can ride the bull?


KYLE
Yeah, I think so.

STAN
Jesus, dude!

KYLE
Hey, where's Cartman?

STAN
Oh, hell!

KENNY

STAN
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have
to go sign him up for the bull ride.


KENNY
(Okay.)

SOUTH PARK POLICE DEPT.

[Tom and Mary are still in jail, shivering and apparently forgotten]


TOM
Huh, it's so cold here.

MARY
Where is that sheriff?! We need water!


TOM
Oh well, let's try to make the best
of it, Mary.

MARY
You're right. We're not being positive.
At least we get some time alone.

TOM
Yeah, and at least we've got our health.


[ranch lands. Two ranchers get out of a truck and walk into a
field]

GREY HAT
I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never
seen nothin' like it.

MITCHELL
Where are they again?

GREY HAT
Just right up over this ridge.  That's
what they've been doin' all morning:
sittn' there and mooin'. And more cows
come all the time.

MITCHELL
Well, I ain't never seen this before,
neither. But I know one thing: when
cows start gettin' together, it can't
be good. They might start formin' a
cult!

GREY HAT
Hm. Cow cult.

[back at the carnival, rodeo riders try out their luck. One of
them loses his luck when his horse throws him off]

ANNOUNCER
The grand-daddy of them all, the South
Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the
bullriding event. Grand prize: $5000!


STAN
Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!


KENNY
(I don't know. I can't find him.)

KYLE
He's up in, like, twenty minutes!

KENNY
(All right! I know!)

CARTMAN
Hello, fren! Hello!

STAN
There he is!

CARTMAN
Sucky-sucky, five dollar.

[back at the police station jail, Tom and Mary just sit and wait]


[Jimbo and Ned join the two ranchers on the ridge]

GREY HAT
There they are, just like we told you.<


JIMBO
Okay, that's enough o' that! You cows
need to dis-perse!  All right, bad cows!
Do you hear me? Bad cows!  All right,
Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the
whip!

NED
Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!
Bad cows stay! Stay!  AAAAAH!

JIMBO
Holy smokes! Play dead, Ned!

GREY HAT
I reckon we should get some help.


MITCHELL
I reckon.

[the boys now have Cartman on the bull, ready to ride]

KYLE
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna
be cake.

STAN
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip
dolls will be ours!

CARTMAN
Hucky-sucky five dollar.

ANNOUNCER
Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!  Three,
two, one.

JACK
Yeehaw! Yeeha! Yeehaw!  Aaaaaaaa!


ANNOUNCER
Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point
deduction.  Up next, no. 14, Ming Li!


CARTMAN
Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me
eight dollar, soldier boy!

ANNOUNCER
Here we go!

STAN
Dude, I'm having second thoughts about
this.

KYLE
What do you mean?

STAN
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's
wrong to put someone who thinks they're
a Vietnamese protstitute on a bull.


ANNOUNCER
Let her go!

CARTMAN
Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!

KYLE
Hang on, Cartman!

ANNOUNCER
Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute
can really ride a bull!  I guess she's
had a lot of practice, if you know what
I mean.

CARTMAN
Aaah! Ten dollar!  Ten dollar, soldier
boy!

ANNOUNCER
She's setting a new world record!

CROWD
Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!

CARTMAN
Gaaah!  Heeee!

STAN
Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.


KYLE
Go help him, Kenny!

KENNY
(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that
ring! Aaah!)

STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastard!

ANNOUNCER
And this brave little whore from the
East has really put on a show for us
today!  The winner of the bullriding
contest: Ming Li!

CARTMAN
Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.


STAN
We did it, dude, we did it!

[the cows are gathered again before the Memorial, about 3 p.m.
Behind some large rocks, FBI agents pop up and take aim at the
cows]

AGENT
Freeze, cows!  The game is over! You
will now return to your respective towns!


JIMBO
You hear that, cows? You're surrounded!
There's no way out!

AGENT
You will now all march in an orderly
fashion into this trailer!  Move!


JIMBO
Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong
way, you stupid cow!

AGENT
Oh, dear Jesus, no!

COW
Mooooo!

JINBO
Nnoo!  They're killing themselves!
Stop! Please!  Can't we do anything?!
Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!


AGENT
This is the first mass cow suicide I've
seen in- at least eight months.

[Tom and Mary still wait in jail]

[The carnival. The boys walk back to Toss-A-Ball]

TOSS-A-BALL OPERATOR
Oh, you boys are back again, huh?

STAN
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.


KYLE
How many ball does that get us?

CARTMAN
Odline daur shunba shunba?

TOSS-A-BALL OPERATOR
Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh,
I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade
you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip
dolls.

KYLE
You will?

STAN
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a
sudden?

KYLE
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won
us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!


CARTMAN
Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?

KYLE
What are we gonna do with them?

STAN
We should-

KYLE
What the-?

STAN
Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!


KYLE
After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans!
SHENANIGANS!

OFFICER BARBRADY
What's all this?

KYLE
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate
my previous Shenanigans! This whole
carnival is a rip-off!

MR. GARRISON
You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree.
These rides are really stupid! Chamber
of Farts isn't scary at all!

PRIEST
Yeah, and the food is terrible!

CHAMBER OF FARTS OPERATOR
Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo. What
do you expect?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People
of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans
on the carnival people?

TOWNSPEOPLE
Yeah!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay, carnival people, do you accept
this decree of Shenanigans?

WOMAN
What the hell are you talking about?!
This whole town is screwy!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, that settles it! Everybody grab
a broom, it's Shenanigans!

[One in the afternoon. Jimbo, Ned, and some townsfolk are pushing
the Cow Memorial back into the carnival area]

THE MAYOR
You found it! You found the memorial!


JIMBO
Yeap.

THE MAYOR
And the cows? Are they all back, too?


JIMBO
They're dead, mayor. They're all dead.


THE MAYOR
What?!

JIMBO
Oho, it was awful!  Cow after cow taking
its own life, and we could do nothing
to stop them! Oh, God!

THE MAYOR
Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn
that cults are never a good thing.


JIMBO
I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. Uhud I
need a cold beer and a burger.  What's
all the ruckus over there?

THE MAYOR
Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!


JIMBO
Oh, hell, I have to run home and get
my broom!

[The police station]

OFFICER BARBRADY
All right, you dammned carnival people.
Into jail with-  Oooooh?

JIMBO
Hey, aren't those the people we at first
thought took the wooden cow?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah.

THE MAYOR
Didn't we ever release them?

JIMBO
Aw, I forgot all about them.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh me, too.

THE MAYOR
Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you
never had Tom and Mary in this cell.


OFFICER BARBRADY
I didn't?

THE MAYOR
No, no. In fact, they never came to
South Park. We've never heard of them.


OFFICER BARBRADY
Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then,
although I could've swore that I had
heard of them and they starved to death
in my prison.

[The bus stop. Stan and Kyle are swimming in Terrance and Phillip
dolls]

STAN
Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.


KYLE
Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look
for treasuh.

CARTMAN
What are you guys doing?

STAN
Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?


CARTMAN
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest
dream last night.

KYLE
Really? What about?

CARTMAN
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese
girl, and then you guys made me ride
a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo
Di Caprio gave me a spankin' for several
hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win
all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?


STAN
Oh-h. Nowhere.

CARTMAN
Wait a minute! You guys did make me
ride that bull!

KYLE
No! Cartman, that was just a dream!


LEONARDO DI CAPRIO
Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again.

CARTMAN
Oh! Son of a bitch!

Episode 607


"SIMPSONS ALREADY DID IT"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Kyle's house, day. Stan and Kyle are happily preparing a snowman,
which now has twigs, buttons, a hat and scarf. Tweek stands behind
Stan holding a carrot.]

STAN
Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek.


TWEEK
I can't.  You do it.

KYLE
Just stick it on.

TWEEK
But what if I put it in the wrong place?


STAN
Just put it between his eyes.

TWEEK
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting
on the nose, the snowman comes to life
and tries to kill me?

STAN
Tweek, when has that ever happened,
except for that one time?

KYLE
Yeah.

BUTTERS
Hey, fellas.

STAN
Oh, hey Butters.

BUTTERS
How are things... oing with your new
best friend?

KYLE
Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly
no Kenny!

TWEEK
Arrrr!

BUTTERS
Yeah, but he's still better than you,
Butters.

KYLE
Yeah.

BUTTERS
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being
their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll
do better than me. Well, see ya fellas.


TWEEK
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure!


CARTMAN
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna
believe it!

STAN
Uh oh.

CARTMAN
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys!
Life isn't so crappy after all!

TWEEK
It's not?

CARTMAN
No! I was looking in this magazine,
and I found an ad for little ocean creatures
that you can buy and raise in your room!


KYLE
No way.

CARTMAN
Look!  Sea people. You keep them under
a big tank of water and they like, build
castles and play basketball and stuff.


KYLE
Nuh uh.

CARTMAN
Yeah! And look! They ride around on
turtles and they play games with fish.


KYLE
No way.

CARTMAN
Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative
Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want
everyone to call you Negative Nancy
from now on.  Now, what we need is to
all chip in four dollars, and we can
have them here tonorrow!

KYLE
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be
cool if they're only sixteen dollars.
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then
it will be $5.35 per person!

STAN
Alright, I'll chip in.

TWEEK
Gah! Me too.

KYLE
Naw, alright.

[Butters' house, day. He reaches his room.]

LINDA
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in
two hours!

BUTTERS
Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up
here, uh doin' my homework.  Yes. By
day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and
innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows
that he actually has a dark underside...
Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak
havoc on the world that shunned me!


DOUGIE
Professor Chaos!

BUTTERS
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction,
General Disarray.

DOUGIE
I have done as you asked and brought
the first load of scrap wood.

BUTTERS
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we
can begin my most horrible evil plan
yet to wreak havoc on humanity.

DOUGIE
What dastardly deed are we doing now?


BUTTERS
Simple, my dear general.  We are going
to block out the sun!

DOUGIE
Oh.

BUTTERS
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and
figured that if we build a huge ...wooden
shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty
feet wide , precisely on this hill,
South Park ...will forever be cast in
a great shadow.

DOUGIE
Oh, awesome!

BUTTERS
Soon, all people will have to live like
moles! They will love only to remember
with sorrow how great the sun used to
be!

DOUGIE
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons.


BUTTERS
Huh?

DOUGIE
They did that on the Simpsons. I think
it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried
to block Springfield from the sun.


BUTTERS
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was
bein' original.

DOUGIE
So how do we build it?

BUTTERS
Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if
they already did it on the Simpsons.
I have to think of something else.
Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I
think of something clever, the Simpsons
already did it?

[Cartman's house, night. The living room light is on. Cartman
is sleeping, dreaming...]

CARTMAN
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...
Yesss... Yeesss...

[The dream sequence]

CARTMAN


Look at me, livin' free

Free and clean amongst the Sea People

[the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take
him into the castle]

We look for pirates and search for gold.

Life is an adventure with the Sea People

[A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As
a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.]


They don't ever conplain, they don't call me fat.

They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.

[he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins
at the camera]

This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,


[Shown walking with the sea couple again.]

Sea people and me.

Sea people and me, you guys.

[The dream ends and the bubbles fade away. Cartman wakes up,
smiling]

CARTMAN
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.
Only three hours and you can take me
away from this crappy goddamned planet
full of hippies.

[Cartman's house, day. He's at his desk with the new kit while
Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand behind him. His dressed as a monarch,
in suit, crown and cape.]

CARTMAN
Okay. I've added the water purifier
tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank.
Now it says  "Step 2.  Add the Sea People
eggs to the water; you will see sea
life spring instantly."  Okay, let's
just run through this one more time:
when the sea people arrive I will welcome
them to South Park as Ambassador of
Earth. Tweek, you give them the key
to the city, and we'll all engage them
in simple conversation. We've gotta
make sea people feel comfortable, okay?
Ready?

STAN
Ready. Let's see 'em.

CARTMAN
Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!
Okay.  Here we go.

STAN
Are they playing basketball?

CARTMAN
What the fuck is this?!

STAN
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used
to feed them to my fish.

CARTMAN
I got RIPPED OFF!

KYLE
I told you, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned
Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's
war in the Middle East!!!  And you,
Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button
your shirt right, for once?! You're
as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend,
always spending time with her!! God,
I hate you guys!!  They were supposed
to take me away to their underwater
kingdom. They were supposed to take
me on adventures of the deep

TWEEK
They package brine shrimp and sell
them to kids? That's not right, man!


STAN
What are we gonna do with them?

CARTMAN
Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!

KYLE
Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's
coffee tomorrow morning.

STAN
Yeah, that'd be funny.

CARTMAN
Heheh, okay, okay.

[next day, Ms. Choksondik's house. The scene from last episode
is carried on here, only zoomed out. The paramedics take Ms Choksondik's
corpse into the ambulance as a crowd looks on. The adults murmur
amongst themselves. The ambulance pulls away and Cartman pulls
the other boys in with some urgency.]

CARTMAN
Alright, listen to me! We must take
a strict vow of silence!

TWEEK
Jesus Christ, we killed her!

CARTMAN
Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!

[Dougie's house. He's doing homework on the living room coffee
table when a doorbell rings. He goes to answer it. He opens the
door and Butters steps in with something under wraps]

BUTTERS
General Disarray, are your parents home?


DOUGIE
No.

BUTTERS
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray.
I've completed my most horrible deed
to date.

DOUGIE
What?

BUTTERS
You know that big statue in the town
square of pioneer John Wesley Powell?
I snuck over there with a hacksaw and
uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa,
yeah!

DOUGIE
Oh, uh...

BUTTERS
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing
that now! Quick! We must turn on the
news!

NEWS ANCHOR
... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps
getting bigger.  Also in the news tonight,
a vandal has apparently cut off and
stolen the head of the Powell statue
in the South Park Town Square.

BUTTERS
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've
wreaked havoc!

NEWS ANCHOR
The head was taken in the early morning
hours and the police have no leads.


BUTTERS
I finally made the world sorry! I've
brought sadness, a-and chaos!

NEWS ANCHOR
This act, of course, reminded us all
of the time that Bart Simpson  took
the head of the Springfield statue in
one of their classic episodes. Here's
what some people had to say:

MAN 1
Well, I, I think whoever took the head
was... really just doing an homage to
the Simpsons.  Heh, I think it's great.


WOMAN
Yes, it really made me reflect on that
episode and laugh.

MAN 2
Well the Simpsons is such a great show,
and we need reminders like this to keep
us watching.

BUTTERS
Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.

NEWS ANCHOR
The police say that instead of looking
for the missing head, they'd rather
leave it off and be reminded of the
Simpsons every day.

BUTTERS
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons
already did that?

DOUGIE
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna
bum you out.

BUTTERS
Stupid Simpsons...

[Kyle's house, night. The boys watch TV on the sofa]

TERRANCE
Hello there, Phillip. I brought you
something

PHILLIP
Oh, what is it?

KYLE
See? We're just watching cartoons, like
always. Nothing's changed.

TWEEK
Jesus Christ, she's dead!!

STAN
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like
nothing happened.

TERRANCE
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally
killed Celine Dion.

PHILLIP
Killing is never an accident, you dickface!


STAN
Oh jeez, change the channel.

NEWS ANCHOR
And in other news, still no known cause
of death found for elementary school
teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors
say that during the autopsy they did
find semen in her stomach.

STAN
They found the sea men! It's only a
matter of tiime before they find the
women, too!

NEWS ANCHOR
The autopsy is ongoing and cause of
death is yet to be determined.

KYLE
Oh God!

STAN
We're dead!

TWEEK
Oh Jesus!  That's it, man! I want nothing
more to do with you guys!

CARTMAN
Tweek! Where are you going?

TWEEK
They're gonna find you out! Then when
they do I don't wanna be within fifty
feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!


STAN
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much
as we are!

TWEEK
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea
people in her coffee! I wasn't even
there when you did it!

KYLE
Yeah, but you're our new friend and
that makes you cul.. p-piable!

CARTMAN
In fact, that makes you the most responsible.
Tweek, you might have to take the fall
on this one.

TWEEK
Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!

[Chef's house, night. The boys arrive at his house and ring the
bell. He opens the door and sees them]

CHEF
Oh, welll, hello there, children.

STAN
Chef, we did something kind of bad.


KYLE
We don't know who else to talk to.


CHEF
Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems
ain't all that bad. Come on in.  Now,
just sit down and take a deep breath
and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.


STAN
We need you to promise not to tell
anybody.

CHEF
Nowww, children, every problem can be
worked out. What was it?

STAN
We... killed our teacher and they found
our seamen in her stomach

CHEF
...Oh, children, that's a problem we
all have to face at one time or another.
Here: let me sing you a little song
that might cheer you up. Sometimes you
kill your teacher and they find your
semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What
the what?!

STAN
So what should we do?

KYLE
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.


CARTMAN
We've only got one option, you guys.
We're gonna have to go to that hospital
where they're doing the autopsy and
get our seamen back ourselves.

TWEEK
Gnaaahahahah!  I pulled out my hair!


[Dugie's house, night. In the living room Butters begins to pitch
ideas.]

BUTTERS
Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm
going' to pose as a real-estate agent
and con everyone in town into buyin'
a monorail. And then skip town with
all their money.  No?

DOUGIE
...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode
204.

BUTTERS
Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web
site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about
everyone in town! And and then I'll
take their-

DOUGIE
Simpsons did it!

BUTTERS
I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel
wings so that the townspeople will think
a fallen angel has fallen-

DOUGIE
Simpsons did it!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, night. Cartman leads the other boys into
the coroner's office]

STAN
This is it.

CARTMAN
Alright, everyone scatter and look for
the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door
and keep a look out. If you see anybody
coming, say the code word: Hammertime.


TWEEK
Hammertime? Can't the code word just
be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!


CARTMAN
Ugh.  Just remember the song "Can't
Touch This" and you'll remember the
code word!

STAN
Yeah, stupid.

TWEEK
Oh, God.

KYLE
There's nothing here!

STAN
Dude, it's probably in her stomach.


CARTMAN
Is it her?

KYLE
Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.


STAN
What do we do now?

CARTMAN
Just reach in there and get the seamen
out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys
are such pussies!  Hemmm...

TWEEK
Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme-
I can't remember uh-the code word!


STAN
Do you see the sea people.

CARTMAN
No, just a bunch of goo.

TWEEK
You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum,
dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum,
dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.


KYLE
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside.

STAN
Yeah.

TWEEK
...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!


STAN
Aaah!

KYLE
Quick. Hide.

VOICE
Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon
Sharp back.

DOCTOR 1
Alright, let's just leave the semen
sample next to the corpse; I wanna run
a hair fiber test next.

DOCTOR 2
Hey, do you smell children?

DOCTOR 1
No, that's not...

KYLE
Got it!

STAN
Let's go!

[Butters house, later that night. Butters presents plan #127-C]


BUTTERS
Bring the World Cup to South Park so
the... a huge soccer riot can destroy
the-

DOUGIE
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!

BUTTERS
Take all the beer cans in South Park
and have them shaken up in a huge mixer
at the paint store so that-

DOUGIE
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come
To This!"

BUTTERS
Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about
destroying the town and just run away
and join the circus!

DOUGIE
...Simpsons did it.

BUTTERS
Dwaah!!

[Cartman's house, later. In his room he takes the semen sample
and pours it into his tank, tapping the rim of the tank so the
semen can start moving. The semen slides into the tank and puts
the lid back on]

CARTMAN
There. We just put the sea people back
in the tank with the others, and nobody
will ever know.  The blood is washed
neatly from our hands.

CHEF
Alright, children, I got you four tickets
to Thailand  and three hundred dollars
cash . It's gonna be tough living for
a while. You might have to do things
for money you never thought of doin'
before.

CARTMAN
It's alright, Chef! We got our sea
people out of the teacher's stomach.and
we put them back in their aquarium!


CHEF
...Wait, what? Sea people?

STAN
The sea people that we put in the teacher's
coffee.

CHEF
Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the
beginning.

[Forty-three seconds later...]

STAN
...and then we put them back in the
tank.

CHEF
Oohhh, children, you misunderstood.
Sea people is different from se-men.


KYLE
It is?

CHEF
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial
didn't come from you, it came from someone
else.  I thought you children took turns
rapin' and then murdered the teacher.


CARTMAN
Well if they found somebody else's sea
men in her stomach, maybe they'll find
our sea people, too.

CHEF
Relax, children, junk that's in brine
can't kill you. Your teacher must have
died from something else.

KYLE
Oh, really??

TWEEK
Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!

CHEF
Alright. You children have had a long
night. Why don't we all get some rest
and on Monday, I'll sing you a song
explainin' the difference between semen
and sea people.  Come on, children.
I'll walk you all home.

STAN
Okay. Goodnight, Cartman.

CARTMAN
G'night, guys.

KYLE
I'm so glad we're not murderers.

CARTMAN
Ah, so great that everything is finally
back to normal.

[South Park, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand at the bus
station waiting for the bus.]

CARTMAN
H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't
believe it!

STAN
Oh no, what now?

[Cartman's house, later. He leads them to his room, to the tank]


CARTMAN
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach
somehow combined with the remaining
sea people we had left in the tank and,
ah, well LOOK!

KYLE
Whoa.

STAN
Wow. How did that happen?

CARTMAN
I've been up for hours doing some calculations,
and I've come up with my final theory
of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus
sea men equals sea ciety.

KYLE
Whoa.

STAN
They've already accomplished so much.


TWEEK
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms
live much faster lives and do things
at a much faster rate.

CARTMAN
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory
is correct, all we need to get is more
of the two reacting agents, and we can
really see them flourish. Tweek!

TWEEK
Hr!

CARTMAN
You go and send away for mre sea people
from the magazine ad! Get at least five
gallons of them here stat! Stan and
Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank
to them all in.

KYLE
Well what are you gonna do?

CARTMAN
Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and
find ten gallons of sea men.

[Dougie's room, day. Butters and Dougie are in costume. Between
them is a contraption under a white sheet]

BUTTERS
I've done it, General Disarray. I've
watches all one hundred and thirty-two
episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And
I've finally come up with something...
tha they have never done! Uh, behold!
This device that I have made will take
the cherries out of chocolate-covered
cherries and replace the inside instead,
with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People
will think that they are gonna get a
bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but,
instead, they'll get a mouth full of
yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!
You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons,
right?

DOUGIE
No, I think the Simpsons would be more
clever than that.

BUTTERS
Good! Then l-let us take my machine
outside and make society finally pay
for sh-shunning us!

ANNOUNCER
Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama
when Bart builds a machine that takes
cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries
and replace them instead, with mayonnaise.


BUTTERS
Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.

DOUGIE
Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did
it!

BUTTERS
No! No!

DOUGIE
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!


BUTTERS
Aaaaah!

DOUGIE
Don't have a cow, man.

BUTTERS
Oh sweet Jesus!

[Sperm Bank of South Park, day. Cartman hums as he approaches
the door. He enters and walks down the hall. The tellers follow
him with their eyes.]

WOMAN
Can I help you?

CARTMAN
Yes, my mommy told me this is where
I could find some sea men?

WOMAN
Your... mom told you?

CARTMAN
Do you have them or not?

WOMAN
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally
to children.

CARTMAN
What's your name?

WOMAN
Frances Velman

CARTMAN
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a
bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't
a bunch of bullcrap from me, right?
Where does that get us? Nowhere. The
truth is, I'm completely certified to
handle sea men, and though I may appear
young, I'm one of the leading sea men
authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer,
you know what I'm saying? I'll have
my own business soon and I'll need people
to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances.
And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income.
How does that sound?

WOMAN
Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce.
One donor, certified, on record.


CARTMAN
I see, very interesting.

FRANCES
What are you doing?

CARTMAN
Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality
stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good
texture, nice consistency. Sea men must
be alive and healthy in there. I'll
take five.

FRANCES
Five? Vials?

CARTMAN
No, gallons.

FRANCES
Www-we don't have that much here.

CARTMAN
Damint! Give me all you've got, then!


[South Park, in town. Butters runs from Dougie, who chases after
him]

BUTTERS
Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!

DOUGIE
Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!!


BUTTERS
Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on!


MS. CRABTREE
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!

BUTTERS
Haaah!

MR. GARRISON
Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?

CHEF
Hello there, children!

BUTTERS
Aaah! Nooo!

MR. GARRISON
...What the hell's wrong with him?


[Cartman's room, later. Stan looks at the aquarium and sees the
civilization has developed further. Pyramids now appear. The
sound of running water is in the background. Cut to Kyle filling
a larger tank with a water hose.]

STAN
Look, the sea people have evolved to
an Egyptian-like culture.

TWEEK
Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.


CARTMAN
That should be enough water, Kyle.
You got the new sea-people packets,
Tweek?

TWEEK
Uh-uh huh.

STAN
Well, drop them in!

CARTMAN
And I've got the sea men.

KYLE
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've
got there, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this
bank, and then I got the rest from this
guy Ralph in an alley.

STAN
That's cool.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid
asshole didn't even charge me money
for it. He just made me close my eyes
and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There
we go.

STAN
Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in
its new home.

CARTMAN
Nothin' to do now but wait.

STAN
...Close your eyes and suck it out of
a hose?

CARTMAN
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.


STAN
Hm.

KYLE
Huh.

[Cartman's house, next day. He's asleep, but begins to stir.
His eyes open and he grins at what he sees. He hops off the bed
and rushes to the tank. He looks here and there and finds a more
advanced civilization in the tank.]

CARTMAN
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization
has advanced hundreds of years.  Look!
There's a library! A-and a temple! And
a- woh-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!!
I am god of the sea people!!! You hear
that?!  I am god of the sea people!!!
I am master of their great sunken empire!!!
Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!


LIANE
That's nice, poopie.

[Butters' house, day. He's sitting in the living room, which
now takes the appearance of the Simpson living room]

NEWS ANCHOR
And in other South Park News, elementay
school teacher Ms. Choksondik's  autopsy
has shown that the semen in her stomach
belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey.
However, the semen apparently did NOT
contribute to the death, and so Mr.
Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous.


STAN, KYLE
Hey Butters.

BUTTERS
Haaa!

STAN
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman
says he has something really cool to
show everybody. You've gotta come.


BUTTERS
Cartman?

CARTMAN
Ha ha!

[Cartman's house, whick now looks like a typical Springfield
house, day. In Cartman's room, everyone but Butters is shown
Simpsons-style. Present are Chef, Mr. Garrison, Liane, Tweek,
Timmy, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, and Butters. Cartman displays
his new sea ciety]

CARTMAN
Behold! You all see my tiny minions
groveling at my likeness! I am Eric
Cartman, god.

KYLE
Hey. We paid for the sea people too.
How come they're not making statues
of us?

CARTMAN
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator
of all things, yea.

MR. GARRISON
That is very impressive, Eric. What
do you intend to do with your underwater
society?

CARTMAN
I'm gonna send a message to my people
and tell 'em to develop a great machine
that will shrink me down to their size,
so I can live amongst them forever.


BUTTERS
Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!

CARTMAN
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?


BUTTERS
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse
of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis
tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria
on it start to grow, and makes a little
society, and they build a statue of
her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!


CARTMAN
...So?

KYLE
...Yeah. So?

CARTMAN
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything
already. Who cares?

STAN
Yeah, and they've been on the air for
like, thirteen years. Of course they've
done everything.

MR .GARRISON
Every idea's been done, Butters, even
before the Simpsons.

CHEF
Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off
of a Twilight Zone episode.

BUTTERS
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come
up with an idea, and the Simpsons already
did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.
Everything is back to normal, a, I
think... I think I can go back to tryin'
to destroy the world again.

CHEF
Good for you!

CARTMAN
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get
the hell out of my room.

BUTTERS
I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready
to wreak havoc once again!

STAN
Hey, look everybody! The other side
of the aquarium is building another
statue!

KYLE
Hey! It's Tweek.

TWEEK
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god.
That is waaay too much pressure.

CARTMAN
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop
worshiping him, sea people!

MR. GARRISON
What's going on now?

KYLE
The sea people from Cartman's side are
suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's
side.

TWEEK
Gaaa-hah!

CARTMAN
Yeah! Go!

TWEEK
NOW what's happening?

STAN
The sea people on Tweek's side just
suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.


CARTMAN
Oh God-damnit!

CARTMAN
Oh no! Oh the humanity!

MR. GARRISON
Well it was a nice project while it
lasted, boys.

KYLE
Yep. But I guess this proves that war
is the natural order of life.

CARTMAN
Why can't societies just live in peace?

Episode 904


"BEST FRIENDS FOREVER"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Dawn over Cartman's house. He runs into his mother's bedroom]


CARTMAN
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM,
GET UP!

LIANE
Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.


CARTMAN
Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game
machines go on sale at seven a.m. today.
I have to be the first to get one!
Come on!

LIANE
Sweetie, can't we go after school?


CARTMAN
Everyone's moms are taking their kids
after school! We're outsmarting everyone
by getting to the store right when it
opens! Let's go!

[Liane's car, some time later. She and Cartman drive along, Cartman
bouncing happily in his seat]

CARTMAN
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's
faces when I show up to school with
a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh
PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!


[Before them is a long line of people in front of Luau's Toys
waiting for the PSP. The camera reaches the front of the line
only to find Kenny right at the front door. He's the first one
in line. Cartman approaches Kenny]

CARTMAN
Kenny, when did you get here?

KENNY
(Friday)

CARTMAN
Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort
of get in here- in here.

TALL GOTH
Hey dickhole! What do you think you're
doing?

CARTMAN
Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place
in line.

SIXTH GRADER
There's no saving place, fourthie! Get
to the back or we'll beat your face
in!

CARTMAN
Oh, Goddamnit!  They'd better not sell
out!

[The bus stop, later in the day. Kenny is playing with his PSP
as Stan and Kyle look on. Stan and Kyle weren't in line]

KYLE
That thing is pretty cool. What games
did you get with it?

STAN
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell."
Kenny commands the armies of heaven
against the forces of Satan.  Dude,
you see what Kenny got?

CARTMAN
YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!

KYLE
Wuh what'd I do?

CARTMAN
JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!

GAME VOICE
"Congratulations! You have reached ...lever
nine!"

KYLE
Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick
ass in "Heaven versus Hell."

STAN
Yeah, Kenny finally found something
he's really good at.

[A montage follows. Kenny is seen in class playing on his PSP,
then in the cafeteria, then in the playground, then in his bedroom
at night. He reaches lever 24. He's then seen at the amusement
park with his family, still playing with his PSP, then in "The
Mine Shaft" roller coaster, where he reaches lever 45. He's seen
on the bus playing on his PSP while the other students are having
fun, then in Le Bijou playing while Stan and Kyle watch a movie,
then on the sidewalk passing some hot babes - he doesn't look
up to acknowledge them, then in his bed again at night. He reaches
lever 54.]

[Kenny's house, day, the kitchen. He's still playing on his PSP]


MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin'
with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two
weeks and you've done nothin' else!


KENNY
(I could get to level sixty!)

MRS. MCCORMICK
Who cares if you almost made it to lever
sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny!
If you died tomorrow, what would you
have to show for it?! You'er gonna end
up wishin' you'd done more with your
life, just like your dead-beat father!


STUART
Hey, I heard that, bitch!

MRS. MCCORMICK
I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!


STUART
How about I come in there and kick
your teeth in!

MRS. MCCORMICK
I'd like to see you try!

[Kenny leaves the house and goes to the sidewalk]

STUART
Goddamnit, do you have to smart off
at me in my own house?!

MRS. MCCORMICK
It's my house too, you no-good loser!


GAME VOICE
You have reached level sixty!

KENNY
(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached lever
s-!)

DRIVER
Oh yeah, lever four, sweet!

[The street. Kenny's body lies on the road. Eventually his soul
rises out of his body]

KENNY
(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating.
That can't be! Hey wait!)

[He reaches heaven, right side up, and bounces once before landing.
He walks towards the Golden Gates]

ANGEL 1
Open the gate!

ANGEL 2
Open the gate!

PETER
Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny.
I am Peter.

KENNY
(What the fuck is going on?)

PETER
There isn't much time, Kenny. You're
dead, but, your death was no accident.
Heaven needs you.

KENNY
(Me??)

PETER
Come! There is much to discuss.  Things
are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan
is planning a massiva attack and he
knows we are too few in number to stop
him! God has changed the rules here.
For ages, only Mormons were allowed
into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell
was becoming much larger, God decided
to let more people cross over so that
he could build an army as well, an army
that YOU must command.

KENNY
(That I what??)

PETER
The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine
who on Earth had the best skills to
defeat the armies of Satan. You... are
the best. YOU, are the only hope for
the universe.

[In a great courtyard outside the super-basilica. An angel addresses
the others]

ANGEL 3
Satan's army grows as we speak. The
Dark Lord knows that our armies are
few in number, and unorgamized. So our
only hope... is perfect strategy.


ANGEL 4
A child? This is God's solution?

PETER
He beat Satan's army in over three thousand
separate simulations.

ANGEL 4
Archangel Michael, what say you?

MICHAEL
The child did something none of us
could: Reach lever sixty on the PSP.
Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverence,
but it's Goddamned impressive. All right,
Kenny, let me show you what we're up
against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven.
Satan's armies will attack the gate
...here. They are... ten billion in
number. Maybe more.  Our armies are
here, here, and here. Just under...
ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered
and in need of someone who can singlehandedly
bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically,
Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves.

[Hell. Satan's armies mill about, the troops arm each other.
Satan addresses them]

SATAN
My fellow damned souls! Now is the time
for our assault!  You know no fear!
You will drink the blood of angels!
We go now! Nothing can stop us!

ANGEL 5
Step aside! Step aside, I say!  Satan!
God has mocked thee once again!

SATAN
My spy!

ANGEL 5
God has found a way to defeat your army.


SATAN
Impossible! How?!

ANGEL 5
A young man. Basically, he he's like
Keanu Reeves.

SATAN
Oh Jesus Christ.

HOODED FIGURE
My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!


SATAN
What's the point?! They have a Keanu
Reeves now.

HOODED FIGURE
Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!


SATAN
Very well.  Demon Army, begin your march
on Heaven!

[Michael and Kenny walk to one of the ramparts and look out over
Heaven]

MICHAEL
Up here, you get the best tactical view
to protect the fortress. It is from
here, Kenny, that you shall command
the armies of heaven.

KENNY
(All right. How am I supposed to do
that?)

ANGEL 6
Simple. You will use... this.

MICHAEL
This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.


ANGELS
Hail the holy PSP.

MICHAEL
It works just like the ones we sent
to Earth. All the commands you make
will be sent to the troops down on the
battlefield. All you have to do is play
the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's
for reals.

ANGEL 7
Gabriel returns with news!

GABRIEL
Hell's army is departing! They head
now for the Gates of Heaven.

MICHAEL
Prepare the troops!  We must be ready
for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny.
The stage is set and the final battle
between Heaven and Hell is about to
begin! The fate of the outcome is in
your hands.  Where'd he go?

[Hell's Pass Hospital. The paddles have been taken to Kenny and
fired away.]

FEMALE NURSE
Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!

THE DOCTOR
Then that's it! We brought him back.


MALE NURSE
Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody
who's been legally dead for almost a
day!

THE DOCTOR
Call the parents. They're going to be
shocked to find out... their son is
alive.

[Hell's Pass, later]

THE DOCTOR
It's the latest in electro-plastilical
science. Your son's organs are all functioning
again.

STUART
It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.


THE DOCTOR
I'm a-fraid he can't respond to you.
You see, being dead for that long, most
of Kenny's brain cells died from lack
of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in
what we call a "persistant meditative
staute."

MRS. MCCORMICK
Will he ever recover?

THE DOCTOR
I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be
repaied once dead. But his soul is still
in here.  Almost... trapped in here,
if you will. Kenny is the same as he
ever was. It's just that, now, he's
more like ...a tomato.

STUART
He can't more on hiw own-ah how will
he eat?

THE DOCTOR
A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient
paste directly into Kenny's stomache.
With it we can actually keep Kenny the
tomato alive for years.

[Back in heave, business goes on as usual]

MICHAEL
A feeding tube?!

GABRIEL
Yes. Apparently they're using machines
to keep them alive.

MICHAEL
But... that's not natural. God intended
Kenny to die! What are these people
doing?!

ANGEL 3
The child's soul is now trapped inside
his vegetative body. We have no one
to command the troops with the PSP's


GABRIEL
And Satan's armies are approaching.


MICHAEL
Oh God-damnit

[A brick building. Inside, a lawyer sees the four boys.]

LAWYER
Boys I want to thank you for coming
down to my office on such short notice.


STAN
Are we in trouble or something?

LAWYER
No. Boys, I'm a laywer. Your friend
Kenny has passed away and I've called
you here to read his will.

KYLE
Kenny had a will?

LAWYER
In the highly liekly event of my death,
I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all
my belongings to my good friends, Stan
and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends
a guy could have.

STAN
Oh wow...

KYLE
That's... really touching.

CARTMAN
Fag!

LAWYER
To Eric Cartman: Eric, I never really
liked you. But then, nobody does. You
have no ability to feel, and you are
going to die alone and miserable. It
is only because I feel so sorry for
you that I leave you my Sony PSP.


CARTMAN
Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man?
Who the man?

LAWYER
There is one more thing I would like
to ask you all, as my friends. If I
should ever be in a vegetative state
and kept alive on life-support, please,...


STAN
Please what?

LAWYER
I don't know. I lost the last page.


CARTMAN
Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I
take possession of my PSP, sir?

LAWYER
It's right here, along with Kenny's
other belongings. They're all yours.


CARTMAN
Yes!

MAN
He's alive!

STAN
What?

MAN
Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital!


KYLE
Oh my God!

[Satan's armies continue their march to Heaven. Satan looks on
through his crystal ball]

HOODED FIGURE
Your army nears the Kingdon of Heaven,
my Lord.

SATAN
I don't know if we should continue without
knowing more about this Keanu Reeves
God has.

SPY ANGEL
Satan! I come bearing good news! The
Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on
Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.


SATAB
Then God is helping us.  Full march,
to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!


[The boys reached Hell's Pass and enter Kenny's recovery room
]

STAN
Kenny??

KYLE
Kenny! You're alive!

STAN
Dude, how's you do that??

THE DOCTOR
He can't responde to you, boys. Being
dead for that long caused severe damage
to his brain,

CARTMAN
Well... well then he's NOT alive.

MRS. MCCORMICK
He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk
to him. I think...

CARTMAN
That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint
and sets things on fire! Here, look.
Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?


STUART
I I don't know if it's right to keep
Kenny alive on that machine. I I just...
I don't know what he would want.

STAN
Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.

CARTMAN
Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me
this one time, that he wouldn't wanna
be kept alive via feeding tube.

MRS. MCCOMRICK
He did? When?

CARTMAN
Um, it was um, this one time...

KYLE
He did not say that! You just want him
dead so you can have his stupid PSP!


CARTMAN
Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all
hear that??  Uh I mean, I mean this
isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about
my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny
said he didn't want to live like this!


KYLE
He did not!

CARTMAN
Did so!

KYLE
Did not!

CARTMAN
Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin'
Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube
removed if I have to go all the way
to the Supreme Court!

[Heaven. The angels mill around inside the fortress]

PETER
Satan's army has crossed over the Plains
of Limbo!

GABRIEL
Then they will be here on the morrow.
Without Kenny's soul here there will
be nobody who can use the holy PSP.


URIEL
No! There is another. A Japanese boy
did make it to level fifty-nine.

MICHAEL
Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people
don't have souls!

ANGEL 9
Yeah

ANGEL 10
Yeah

ANGEL 11
Yeah

ANGEL 12
Yeah, Uriel!

URIEL
Oh, right right, I'm sorry

MICHAEL
Kenny remains our only hope! Here is
what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel,
you go down to Earth and try to get
that feeding tube removed. In the meantime
we will put all our troops at Heaven's
Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Aermy
from breaking through as long as possible.
Hopefull, it will be long enough to
get our Keanu Reeves back.

[The Colorado Supreme Court, day.]

CARTMAN
You see your honor, I was the only one
that Kenny McCormick told his wishes
to. And Kenny told me specifically that
he would never want to be kept alive
on a machine. What they're doing to
him ...is not right.

CHIEF JUSTICE
Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents
want their child kept alive. I don't
believe you have any legal authority
here.

CARTMAN
I do have legal authority, your honor.
You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.

JUDGE 2
Best friends forever?

CARTMAN
That's right. Kenny and I have been
BFFs since first grade. Here, look.
Kenny has the other half of this BFF
necklace. I believe you all know what
that means, and how serious this is.


[Hell's Pass hospital, Kenny's room. Kenny's parents keep vigil
with Stan and Kyle.]

MRS. MCCORMICK
Look, Kenny, your friends are here to
visit you again.

THE DOCTOR
But this just doesn't seem right.


STUART
Wha, what's the matter, doctor?

THE DOCTOR
I'm afraid I've been given a court order
to remove Kenny's feeding tube.

MRS. MCCORMICK
What?

CARTMAN
He's right in here.

KYLE
Cartman!

CHIEF JUSTICE
Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want
to be kept alive artificially. The courts
have determined we must obey his wish.


KYLE
Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!

POLICE OFFICER
Sir, take a look at this.

CHIEF JUSTICE
That's all the verification we need.
Pull the feeding tube, doctor.

MRS. MCCORMICK
No doctor! You can't!

THE DOCTOR
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

[Hell's Pass hospital, outside. Uriel and Gabriel arrive]

GABRIEL
Here is the hospital

URIEL
This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot
interact with anything on Earth, how
could we possibly get a feeding tube
removed?

KYLE
That dirty no-good sonofabitch!

STAN
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding
tube out, he he's gonna die for sure!


GABRIEL
The tube has been removed?

KYLE
How can they let an eight-year-old decide
Kenny's fate?

URIEL
Apparently, some blessed child has done
our work for us.

GABRIEL
Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody
interferes with the child's death a
second time.

KYLE
Dude, we have to do whatever we can
to get that feeding tube put back in!


STAN
Yeah!

GABRIEL
No!

STAN
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make
everyone in the country know that they're
killing Kenny.

KYLE
Yeah, come on!

URIEL
No! No, no boys! Aw Goddamnit!

[HBC World News. Splashy graphics.]

ANCHOR
This is HBC News. A right-to-die case
debate is heating up in Colorado,  where
Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been
removed by his BFF.  Two boys are bringing
national attention to this story by
protesting outside the hospital.

[Hell's Pass hospital, outside. The protest has begun]

STAN
Don't kill Kenny!

ALL
You bastards!

STAN
Don't kill Kenny!

ALL
You bastards!

URIEL
No! No, they're not killing him, they're
letting him die!

SKEETER
You bureaucrats have no right to play
God and take that tube out!

GABRIEL
Nono, see, they were playing God when
they put the feeding tube IN!

ANCHOR
A woman was arrested for trying to bring
food to the patient.

MRS. GARRISON
Get your man-hands off of me!

ANCHOR
However, a growing number of people
are also standing behind Kenny's BFF,
Eric Cartman.

MAN 1
We must respect the wishes of people's
BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces
would become meaningless

MAN 2
We all have BFFs, and we believe that
a BFF is the highest legal authority.


CARTMAN
That's right. Respect our authoritih-m.


[Satan watches on his TV, which is much nicer than the one in
his bedroom. The hooded figure stands nearby]

SATAN
What mockery is this?!

HOODED FIGURE
My Lord...

SATAN
The feeding tube has been pulled! If
the child dies and his soul returns
to heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!


HOODED FIGURE
Perhaps the child won't die in time.


SATAN
Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!


HOODED FIGURE
No! Keep your army marching, my Lord.
I will get that feeding tube put back
in.

SATAN
How?

HOODED FIGURE
I will do what we always do: Use the
Republicans.

[The White house, a press conference on the lawn. People carry
signs saying "Kenny Is Alive" "Murder Is Not A Choice" and "Don't
Kill Kenny"]

GEORGE BUSH
We Republicans are deeply saddened by
the tragic events in Colorado.

HOODED FIGURE
Removing the feeding tube is murder,
hughughughughughugh...

GEORGE BUSH
Removing the feeding tube is murder!


HOODED FIGURE
Who are we to decide if Kenny should
live or die?

GEORGE BUSH
Who are we to decide if Kenny should
live or die?

HOODED FIGURE
Who are we to decide if Kenny should
live or die?

HOODED FIGURE
It is God's will that he live!

No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha.

ANGEL 9
Jesus, their army is massive.

ANGEL 10
Heaven help us.

[HBC World News.]

ANCHOR
The biggest battle of all time is about
to begin: the battle of the feeding
tube! As people on both sides of the
argument vie for media attention.


[Kenny's hospital room. Both sides of the controversy chatter
away]

KYLE
We want all the country to see that
Kenny is alive, and in pain!

CARTMAN
I believe the people at home see he's
NOT in pain because he's a tomato!


KYLE
You say tomato, but I say Kenny!

CARTMAN
You say Kenny, but I say tomato!

CARTMAN'S SIDE
Tomato!

KYLE'S SIDE
Kenny! Kenny!

CARTMAN'S SIDE
Tomato!

JUDGE
Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the
last page of Kenny's will.

CARTMAN
What?

JUDGE
I found the page where Kenny specified
his wishes about being on life support.


STAN
Well, what does it say?

JUDGE
If I should ever be in a vegetative
state and kept alive on life support,
please...  for the love of God, don't
ever show me in that condition on national
television.

STAN
Oooo.

MAN
Oowhoops

KYLE
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get
out of hand. This issue is so complicated,
but... mmaybe we shhhould just let Kenny
go in peace.

STAN
You mean, Cartman's side is right?


KYLE
Cartman's side is right, for the wrong
reasons. But we're wrong, for the right
reasons.

BOTH SIDES
Yeah.

KYLE
Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants
to be left alone.

[HBC World News.]

ANCHOR
We've just received word that Kenny
McCormick... has passed away. The debate
still rages on in America, but at least
now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful
place.

ANGEL 11
The armies of Satan have already broken
through the gate!

Send our troops to the battlefield!
I'll command as best I can!

did the right thing!

army charges! Tell our troops what to
do, Kenny!  So it begins.  Now we shall
see the final battle between Heaven
and Hell play out!  Yesss, good, Kenny!
The angel spearmen are taking out their
demon soulrippers! Oh, the cavalry angels
are clashing with their Black Knights!
Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic!
Ohh, they're bringing in their demon
dragons! Look at the size of them! My
God, this is even bigger than the final
battle in the Lord of the Rings movie!
It's like, it's like TEN times bigger
than that battle!

[Hell. Satan is watching the battle through his crystal ball]


SATAN
No! NO! How are we losing?!

SPY ANGEL
The child's soul is in Heaven! God has
his secret weapon!

SATAN
We'll retreat!

Patience, my Lord!

SATAN
No, Kevin!  That's it! I'm breaking
up with you!

MICHAEL
Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are
retreating! This is TRULY a sight to
behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder!
We have done it! We have defeated the
armies of Satan!

PETER
Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved
all of Heaven!

Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all

And now a word from our sponsor.

A commercial begins. An image of desolate, barren land.

FEMALE VOICE

Here in the heart of Africa, children
are dying. Not from disease or war...
but from hunger.

An image of starving kids with flies all around them.

FEMALE VOICE
I'm Sally Struthers...

Sally steps in front of the camera; a big, fat pig.

SALLY STRUTHERS
These children are in desperate need,
and only you can help.

Hey, who's that fat chick?

KYLE
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to
be on Full House.

STAN
Oh.

SALLY STRUTHERS
You see, here in the middle of Africa,

SALLY STRUTHERS
For just five dollars a month, you

this Taiko Digital Sports watch as a
free gift.

CARTMAN
KICK ASS!!

STAN
Sweet!!

The boys all rush to the phone.

STAN
I'll call! I know my mom's credit

Stan dials the number.

KYLE
Did they say if its water-proof?

STAN
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?

Oh...

KYLE
What'd she say?

STAN
Shut up, butt pirate, I'm trying to

KYLE
Ass rammer.

STAN

Yes... Yeah, we want to adopt a
starving Etheropian.

CARTMAN
When do we get the sports watch?

STAN
JUST A SECOND, FAT ASS!!

CARTMAN
You vas diferens!

STAN
(Into the phone)
Hello? No, it's a mastercard...

Stan suddenly stops and puts the phone down.

The boys all look at Cartman, who just shrugs.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rpmh.

STAN
Oh.

KYLE
Ask her if we get the watch right

STAN
(Back to the phone)
Do we get the sports watch right

She says we do.

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The class is decorated with Thanksgiving garb. The boys are
ancy in their seats.

KYLE
I can't wait to get out of school
and get our Taiko Sports watch!

CARTMAN
Yeah, but I get to wear it first. I
said!!

Mr. Garrison steps in front of the class.

MR. GARRISON
Children, children, to honor this
special time of year, we'll be doing
a canned food drive. Does anybody
know what a canned food drive is?

Cartman raises his hand.

MR. GARRISON
Yes, Eric?

CARTMAN
When they cut up a chick's stomach
to get a baby out?

MR. GARRISON
...No, that's a Caesarian section,
Eric... But that's okay. Remember
there are no stupid questions, just
stupid people.

Cartman thinks.

MR. GARRISON
A canned food drive is when we collect
canned food for poor people who can't
afford to eat on Thanksgiving.

STAN
(Pointing)
You mean like Kenny?

MR. GARRISON
Exactly.

CARTMAN
(Raising his hand)
Mr. Garrison, why do poor people
always smell like sour milk?

Garrison sighs and rolls his eyes.

MR. GARRISON
I don't know, Eric, they just do.

Kyle leans over and smells Kenny.

MR. GARRISON
Now children, I want each of you to
bring in ONE CAN of food, and later
the Mayor of South Park will divide
it up amongst Kenny's family and
other poor people.

CARTMAN
I'm not bringing in food for poor
people. Screw them!

WENDY
Don't you want to help those who are
less fortunate?

CARTMAN
Hey you guys, do you hear something?
I think I hear the flower children
calling.

WENDY
This is the one time of year you're
supposed to care about people who
can't eat.

CARTMAN
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?!
What about the poor houses that I
pay for?!

WENDY
Many would rather die than go to
those places!

CARTMAN
Well then perhaps they should, and
decrease the surplus population!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens
for one day. Let's get on with our
lesson. Right Mr. Hat?

MR. HAT
That's right Mr. Garrison, Englbert
Humperdink was the first person on
the moon, who was second?

Suddenly, a group of turkeys burst into the classroom and
gobble loudly.

CLYDE
AGHAGAGAH!!!!!

The turkeys peck and move wildly, causing all the kids to
jump up on their desks. Even Mr. Garrison gets up on his
desk.

MR. GARRISON
What the hell is going on?!

The Turkeys quickly tear the room apart. Knocking over desks,
and tearing everything off the walls.

Just as quickly as they came, the turkeys leave. Leaving the
classroom a disaster.

GARRISON
Well... You don't see that everyday.

EXT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Establishing.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The mayor is pacing in her office.

MAYOR
Okay, now once we have all the canned
foods collected... We'll need some
clever way to distribute them to the
poor...

ASSISTANT
It should be something festive!

Suddenly, the genetic engineer (Mr. Mephesto from ep. 105)
bursts into the office with his little monkey boy.

MEPHESTO
Mayor! We've got a very big problem!!

MAYOR
Ah... You're that insane genetic
engineer from up on the hill, right?

MAPHESTO
Yes, and I may have made a horrible
mistake! I was trying to genetically
engineer Turkeys for Thanksgiving...

MAYOR
(Skeptical)
Uh-huhhhh....

MEPHESTO
You know, to provide food for the
needy.

MAYOR
(Still skeptical)
Of course.

MEPHESTO
Well, something went wrong, and the
turkeys broke free, and the worst
part is... They're REALLY pissed
off!

MAYOR
(Still Skeptical)
Nnnaturally...

The Mayor turns to her assistants and does a 'crazy' signal
with her hand. The assistants laugh.

MAYOR
Oh do go on.

MEPHESTO
We have to stop them or they could
destroy everything! Time is short!!

The mayor again turns to her assistants, but this time pulls
out a koo-koo clock, and turns it on so the little bird comes
out -- 'Koo-koo'

The assistants laugh.

MAYOR
You were saying?

MEPHESTO
They act just like normal turkeys,
except they're evil.

MAYOR
Oh, my...

The mayor turns yet again to her assistants, this time, she
pulls a large mule out of nowhere. The mule goes 'heehorr'
and the assistants laugh.

MEPHESTO
Somehow I don't think you're taking
me seriously.

MAYOR
Now why would you say that?

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

The boys BURST in through Cartman's front door.

BOYS
(Ad libbing)
DID IT COME?! DID IT COME?! IS IT
HERE YET?! I GET TO USE IT FIRST YOU
GUYS!!

The boys look around and see nothing.

CARTMAN
Mom... Did our Digital Sports Watch
come yet?

CARTMAN'S MOM
(Peeping in)
Not yet, hon...

The boys all get bummed.

STAN
Damn!

KYLE
Hey look you guys!

ANGLE - TELEVISION

ANNOUNCER
And now back to part two of the
Terrance & Phillip Thanksgiving
Special

TERRANCE
I sure am cold Phillip.

PHILLIP
Yes, and hungry too. Being a Pilgrim
totally sucks ass.

TERRANCE
Gosh, I hope we don't starve.

Phillip suddenly farts.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the door! The boys all look at
each other with huge eyes.

After a pause, they RUSH to the door.

KYLE
THE DIGITAL SPORTS WATCH IS HERE!!!

Cartman opens the door.

The boys' faces all drop.

Standing there, looking pitiful and hungry, is a little
Ethiopian child.

CARTMAN
What the hell?!

STAN
Dude, that's not a digital sports
watch.

KYLE
Hey... It looks like one of those
Etheropians.

STAN
Oh, man! They must have accidentally
sent him instead of the Sports watch!

KYLE
Maybe they took it literally when we
said we wanted to adopt a kid!

The little kid speaks.

STARVIN' MARVIN
(Making clicking sounds)
Embaba dabubu.

KYLE
Whoa! That was cool!

STAN
Yeah, how'd he make those clicking
sounds?

KYLE
What's your name, dude?

STARVIN' MARVIN
Bubu da Barbin.

STAN
I think he said his name is 'Marvin'.

CARTMAN
(Laughing)
Yeah. STARVIN' Marvin!

The boys all laugh.

KYLE
Nice to meet you, Starvin' Marvin!

Marvin blinks.

CARTMAN
Hey Mom!

CARTMAN'S MOM
(Leaning in)
Yes, hon?

CARTMAN
We found a Etheropian; can we keep
him?

CARTMAN'S MOM
Sure, hon.

CARTMAN
Sweet.

STAN
Dude, let's bring him to school
tomorrow!

KYLE
Come on, Starvin' Marvin! I want you
to meet my little brother.

CARTMAN
No, No! He's my son, I adopted him.

STAN
It was MY mom's credit card!

KYLE
Okay, okay we'll switch off. Starvin'
Marvin can stay here for a week.
Then at Stan's, then with me.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and never with Kenny 'cause
his family is too poor.

KYLE
Totally!

The boys all laugh. Kenny kicks Cartman.

CARTMAN
OW!

EXT. STARK'S POND - NIGHT

A young couple is walking along the pond holding hands and
looking lovingly at one another.

WOMAN
Look how the leaves fall so delicately
on the surface of the pond. It's so
beautiful...

MAN
Not as beautiful as you.

WOMAN
Oh!

They kiss. Over the woman's shoulder the man sees a group of
turkeys. They have doubled in number.

MAN
Oh, Darling, look. Thanksgiving
turkeys.

WOMAN
Ooh, They're so beautiful...

MAN
Not as beautiful as you.

The turkeys come close and surround the couple. The man turns
to the woman.

WOMAN
Look at the way they foam at the
mouth. Like beautiful suds of beer.

MAN
Not as beautiful as --

Just then the group of turkeys attacks and tears the couples
clothes to shreds.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #1

INT. ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET - NIGHT

The boys and their families are gathered around a HUGE table.

STAN
This is a great way for you to
experience America, Starvin' Marvin.
This is what we call an 'All you can
eat buffet'.

Marvin looks around nervously.

CARTMAN
Yeah, here you can eat all you want
for only $6.99 That's why we all
come here on Tuesday nights. Except
for Kenny's family, 'cause to them
$6.99 is two year's income.

They all laugh merrily.

CARTMAN
Why is YOUR family poor, Starvin'
Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic
too?

Marvin just sits there. A waiter walks in and sets down a
large plate of shrimp.

CARTMAN
You see, Starvin Marvin, these are
what we call APPETIZERS.

STARVIN' MARVIN
Apee-tiser.

CARTMAN
This is what you eat before you eat...
to make you more hungry.

Marvin can't believe it.

The waiter reappears with several plates of food.

CARTMAN
Oop! Food's here! That's it for the
appetizers!

Cartman grabs the plate of shrimp and tosses it into a trash
can. Marvin's eyes absolutely pop.

The boys start to gorge themselves.

CARTMAN
No Starvin' Marvin that's my pot
pie!

STAN
Cartman you butt pipe, this is the
time of year you're supposed to share.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah you're right.
(to Marvin)
Are you going to eat all of your
peach cobbler? No you don't want all
that. Why don't you share it with
me... Let me just have some of that.

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Garrison stands before the class holding a box that reads
"Canned Food Drive."

GARRISON
Children, children, I'm a little
disappointed in your Thanksgiving
spirit. Only a few cans have been
donated to our canned food drive...

Garrison pulls out a few cans.

GARRISON
And can't we do a little better than --
(Reading the cans)
Creamed corn, creamed corn and creamed
corn?

The class stares blankly.

GARRISON
Please bring in more diverse food
children, or else Kenny's family is
going to have a pretty 'corny'
Thanksgiving.

Garrison pauses, and then starts laughing wildly.

The kids all just sit there, Kenny just stares, as Garrison
slaps his knee and laughs like he just told the best joke in
the world.

GARRISON
Corny... Corny... Gravy... Corny
Thanksgiving... Hoo!

Finally, Garrison contains himself.

GARRISON
Anyway, children, I understand a few
of you have brought in something
special for show and tell...

Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny raise their hands.

BOYS
(ad lib)
Yeah, yeah... We did. We do! We do!

GARRISON
All right, boys, show us what you've
brought.

The boys walk with Starvin' Marvin to the front of the class.

KYLE
This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin'
Marvin.

Marvin looks around nervously. He peeks into the box of canned
food.

STAN
He can do really cool stuff with his
voice. Show 'em, Starvin' Marvin.

Marvin says nothing, but instead reaches into the box and
pulls out a can of cream corn.

CARTMAN
No! Starvin' Marvin, that's KENNY's
creamed corn!

Cartman grabs the can and puts it back in the box

CARTMAN
No Starvin' Marvin... That's a BAD
starvin' Marvin!

GARRISON
Boys, what the hell are you doing?
This is horribly, horribly WRONG!!
How did you get this child?

STAN
He was accidentally delivered to us
instead of a sports watch.

GARRISON
The sports watch from the commercial?

KYLE
Yeah, that one.

BEBE
I want a Starvin' Marvin!

CLYDE
Me too!

PIP
Yes I'll pay fifty dollars for one!

All of a sudden, all the other children go crazy. AD LIBBING
'I want a Etheopian' etc.

GARRISON
Boys, you're too young to take care
of a child. I'm afraid I'm going to
have to call the Red Cross and have
him returned.

KYLE
(To Stan)
Aw! I TOLD you we shouldn't have
brought him to school, dude!!

INT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you
can pick him up tonight. Bye now.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now, boys I hope you've learned your
lesson.

STAN
No.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You can't care for this child!

KYLE
But I thought we were supposed to
care on Thanksgiving.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, but you don't actually get
involved with the child's lives.
You're supposed to just send money.
And once in a while they write you a
letter.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a
normal place like South Park.

STAN
So why can't he live here now?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Because he can't!

KYLE
Because why?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Because 8 year olds can't be parents.

KYLE
Then you take care of him.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I can't. I'm, ah, very busy. I send
my $5 a month. See?

STAN
This sucks. Starvin' Marvin is our
friend.

CARTMAN
Oh well, back to the poor country
with you.

KYLE
You better watch what you say Cartman.
You might be poor and hungry some
day.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah, right.

EXT. GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH - DUSK

INT. GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH - DUSK

Inside his lab, Mephesto is looking through a microscope.

MEPHESTO
I knew you were the only person who
would listen to me, Chef.

CHEF
Yeah, well let's get it over with.
This place gives me the Bubujeebies.

MEPHESTO
Look here, my microscope. Tell me
what you see...

Mephesto gestures towards his microscope. Chef puts his eye
on it.

CHEF
Uhh... I see an extreme close up of
Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.

MEPHESTO
Oh, whoops.

Mephesto quickly switches the plates under the microscope.

MEPHESTO
NOW tell me what you see.

CHEF
Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say
it looks like Turkey DNA.

MEPHESTO
Precisely. But look how rapidly its
dividing.

CHEF
What does it mean?

MEPHESTO
It means the turkeys are growing at
an exponential rate. If we don't
destroy them all...

ZOOM IN

MEPHESTO
They'll take over the town. Maybe
the WORLD!!!

CHEF
Oh Fudge!!

Dramatic MUSIC!!

CHEF

Aah, lemme' see that Vanessa Redgrave

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Starvin' Marvin sits in the dark in Cartman's living room.

We hear car doors slam. Starvin' Marvin's eyes grow wide.

The front door bursts open. Two men in suits burst in.

AGENT 1
Hello there little boy, we're looking
for a starving African child who was
accidentally sent here instead of a
Taiko Sports Watch.

Marvin thinks for a LONG time...

Finally, Marvin points to Cartman's bedroom. The agents exit
offscreen.

We HEAR the agents bust into Cartman's room.

CARTMAN (O.S.)
Hey! Hey! What's going on? Hey, let
go of me! I'll kick you in the nuts!
Okay man?

Marvin is looking in the direction of the bedroom. The agents
enter. One has Cartman wrapped in a blanket slung over his
shoulder. We HEAR Cartman mumbling.

AGENT 1
(TO Marvin)
Here's your sports watch, son. Sorry
for the mix up.

Marvin takes the watch. The agents leave.

CARTMAN
(O.S. and distant)
HEY!!!! seriously. You're pissing me
off...

We HEAR the screech of tires. There is a pause. Marvin looks
down at the watch on his wrist. Then he looks up.

STARVIN' MARVIN
Sweeeet.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #2

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - DAY

There is a large crowd gathered in the middle of South Park.
We see the canned food grab capsule. There is a podium and
microphone set up.

The mayor and her assistant stand next to the can grab
capsule.

MAYOR
So, how does this thing work?

ASSISTANT
Well, Mayor. Its based on the cash
grab. But instead of money, the cans
of food are blown around inside the
capsule. The pov catches as many as
he can to feed his family.

MAYOR
Pov?

ASSISTANT
POVerty stricken citizen.

MAYOR
Oh, brilliant!

Suddenly the flock of wild turkeys (it is bigger now) attacks
the Thanksgiving decorations. A flurry of feathers,
decorations and gobbling.

MAYOR
Aaaah! What the HELL is THIS?

ASSISTANT
I don't know, Mayor.
(looking at a program)
I don't think it's listed on the
program.

Mephesto appears again.

MEPHESTO
They're increasing in number!! Mayor,
these are the vicious Turkeys I warned
you about!!

Chef appears Stan, Kyle and Kenny are following him.

CHEF
It's true, Mayor! those turkeys just
ripped apart my cafeteria!! WHOA!!

Just then the turkeys run past Chef, gobbling.

CHEF
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS YOU
BASTARDS!!!

KYLE
Wow! Those are some PISSED OFF
turkeys!!

MAYOR
Okay, people, don't panic. Bring out
the defense squad!

Jimbo and Ned appear with shotguns. They immediately start
firing their guns, and the turkeys start running away.

MEPHESTO
We need more than that! They'll only
come back in increased numbers!!

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Starvin' Marvin is sitting on Cartman's couch eating a pot-

ANGLE - TELEVISION

Terrance and Phillip are both wearing pilgrim costumes sitting

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?

PHILLIP
Beans? Oh, oh, looks like we'll be
at war with these Indians soon. Wait
wait wait, here it comes... Oh, I
crapped my pants.

Terrance lets out a good fart. They both laugh. Marvin laughs.

These children desperately need your
support...

The camera PANS across more starving Ethiopians. Now we see
Cartman in the background.

CARTMAN
(In the distance)
HEY! SOMEBODY GET ME OUT OF HERE!
THIS SUCKS!!

SALLY STRUTHERS
So please call and adopt a child
today.

CARTMAN
(Still in distance)
I'M SERIOUSLY GETTING PISSED OFF
OVER HERE!!!!

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Marvin smiles at the television and takes another bite of
his pot-pie.

CARTMAN'S MOM
(Leaning in)
You want some more cheesy poofs,
hon?

Marvin thinks...

STARVIN' MARVIN
Ya I won da cheesy poof!

CARTMAN'S MOM
Okay!

STARVIN' MARVIN
Sweet.

EXT. ETHIOPIA - DAY

In the barren, desolate African landscape, Cartman is walking
among the starving masses, pissed off.

CARTMAN
This is SERIOUS BullSHIT!! There has
to be a Happy Burger around here
somewhere...

Cartman walks by a starving family.

CARTMAN
(Innocent and Sweet)
Excuse me, I am a lost little boy.
Could you help me?

The family just lies there, dying.

CARTMAN
Well SCREW YOU TOO!!

Cartman storms off.

CARTMAN
(Waving his arms around)
What the? ...Who the hell let all
these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody
ever heard of insect repellent?!

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The whole town has gathered for the Thanksgiving day canned
food grab.

Kenny is onstage with the mayor.

MAYOR
Alright everyone, it's time to give
out canned food to the poor.

The townspeople cheer. Stan and Kyle look at each other with
concern.

STAN
Hey, where's Cartman?

KYLE
I don't know. Do you know where he
is Marvin?

MAYOR
Looks like we have the turkey problem
under control. It's time to embrace
the spirit of giving with the canned
food grab!

MAYOR
(To Kenny)
Come on. Hurry up!

Kenny walks into the capsule. The air-tight door closes behind
him.

Now we see Kenny's family for the first time. His mother,
father, brother and sister are all average looking, but
dressed poorly.

KENNY'S MOTHER
Grab a lot, son!!

MAYOR
HAPPY HAPPY THANKSGIVING. LET'RRRRR
RIP!!!

A whirring sound is heard and the cans begin to fly.

MAYOR
C'MON, GRAB THOSE CANS LITTLE BOY!!

Kenny gets hit with cans and tossed around roughly.

STAN AND KYLE
Come on, Kenny!!

KENNY'S DAD
C'mon son!!

It gets more violent as the power of the air actually picks
Kenny up off the ground and makes him fly around like the
cans.

For a moment we can't even tell what's happening, just a
blur of whirling cans and Kenny. Finally the mayor shuts the
machine off.

Kenny stumbles out, dizzy and holding just one little can.

MAYOR
Now let's see all the goodies you're
gonna take home to your family!!

The mayor grabs the can from Kenny, who passes out.

MAYOR
It looks like he got a... a can of
string beans!

The audience cheers.

But they stop when they hear a familiar, ominous sound...

Gobble, gobble, gobble!!

CHEF
What the...?

STAN
DUDE! THE MUTANT TURKEYS ARE BACK!!!

Everybody panics! They turn to see the turkeys, now a huge
mass, heading towards them!

The turkeys attack! There are hundreds of them and they
immediately tear into everything. It is total pandemonium.
Barbrady tries to keep control.

BARBRADY
Okay, people, move along! Nothing to
see here, lookie loos!

But the chaos continues. There is screaming and blood and
feathers. Finally, the turkeys run off.

Chef climbs onto the stage.

Mephesto runs up to the Mayor.

MEPHESTO
I tried to tell you but you didn't
listen!!

CHEF
(Into the microphone)
Gather 'round everybody, and listen
good! Go to your homes and arm your...
(looking at Monkey
Boy)
What the hell are you supposed to be
anyway?

MEPHESTO
That's not important right now.

CHEF
No! What the hell is this little
thing supposed to be? It doesn't
look like anything.

MAYOR
Chef! The turkeys!

CHEF
Oh alright. Listen up everybody, and
listen good. Go to your homes and
arm yourselves with whatever you
can. We'll meet back here in fifteen
minutes. Hurry!

The people scatter.

CHEF
We're not gonna let our thanksgiving
be ruined by a bunch of turkeys!

EXT. ETHIOPIA - DAY

Cartman now looks beaten, tired and hungry as he roams the
African landscape.

CARTMAN
You guys... Seriously... I'm HUNGRY!!!
I HAVE TO EAT!!!

Just then Cartman notices a group of Americans. Several red
cross members with a box.

CARTMAN
Oh sweet, the Red Cross. I'll have
fried chicken and a side of mashed
potatoes please.

RED CROSS MEMBER
Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We
ran out of funding.

CARTMAN
What!!!!

RED CROSS MEMBER
We just couldn't get enough sponsors
back home. So now we've got to pack
it up.

CARTMAN
But I'm not a starvin' ethernopian.
I have to get back home too.

RED CROSS MEMBER
Sorry dude, we just don't have any
funds. Here have a Taiko sports watch.

CARTMAN
WEAKKKKK!!!!!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK ROLLING HILLS

The residents of South Park are armed and ready for battle
atop a hill. It's like a scene out of braveheart.

They are armed with guns, knifes, baseball bats and pieces
of wood.

MAYOR
People... We all have to do our part
against the evil turkeys...

TOWNSPERSON
There's too many of them.

The townspeople moan.

MAYOR
Come on, where is that Thanksgiving
spirit?

TOWNSPERSON
We can't stop them.

They moan again. But then:

Chef rides in on a horse. His face is painted half blue,
half white.

CHEF
Today you fight for your city! You
fight for your honor! These turkeys
will continue to push until they
have taken everything from us!!

The townspeople listen on, enthralled.

CHEF
These fudged up turkeys from the
crustaceous era can take our lives,
but they can never take our FREEDOM!!!

The townspeople all cheer.

EXT. THE OTHER HILL

On the other side, the turkeys are rallying too.

They are gathered in a mass, ready for battle. One turkey
stands in front of them, it's face is painted half blue,
half white, it appears to be giving a speech.

TURKEY LEADER
Gobble, gobble gobble gobble gobble
gobble gobble gobble! Gobble gobble!!

The turkeys watch on, enthralled.

TURKEY LEADER
Gobble gobble! Gobble, Gobble gobble
gobble gobble gobble gobble!!! gobble
gobble GOBBLE!!!

The turkeys all cheer/gobble.

They turn and face the townspeople.

The townspeople face the turkeys.

KYLE MOONS THE TURKEYS

KYLE
Here you go turkeys!

The turkey leader gives a war gobble! The turkeys all follow.

THE TWO MASSES CHARGE EACH OTHER!!!!

MAYOR
(To Assistant)
Does my hair look okay?

EXT. ETHIOPIA - DAY

CARTMAN
Can't... go on... need appetizer...
(Shouting to the sky)
I'M SORRY GOD, I'M SORRY I MOCKED
POOR PEOPLE!! I'M SORRY I WASN'T
MORE SENSITIVE!! PLEASE!!! PLEASE
GOD!!!!

Cartman falls down.

He just lays there looking dead for several seconds.

CARTMAN
(Quietly)
My God has forsaken me...

COMMERCIAL BREAK #3

Finally, he picks his head up and sees a small building.

Cartman gets up and walks to the building.

CARTMAN
Whoa, I wonder what's in here?

Cartman opens the door --

INT. SMALL BUILDING

The inside is incredible. STACKS upon STACKS of food!

Cheesy Poofs, Pot-pie's, Snacky cakes!!

Cartman's eyes grow huge.

CARTMAN
SNACKY CAKES!!!

There's a big screen television, a beautiful stereo and a
decadent furniture set.

Cartman rounds the corner to find a fat white woman sitting
on the couch eating cake, watching T.V., and being fanned by
two Ethiopians.

CARTMAN
SALLY STRUTHERS?!

SALLY STRUTHERS
(Eating cake)
Who the hell are you?

CARTMAN
Give me that cake!!

SALLY STRUTHERS
(A la Cartman)
Nooo, this is MY cake!

CARTMAN
NO SALLY STRUHTHERS, GIMME THE CAKE!!

SALLY STRUTHERS
Nooo! You can't have any!!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?!

Cartman walks back out the door.

EXT. SMALL BUILDING

Cartman bursts out the door and shouts to all the Ethiopians.

CARTMAN
YOU GUYS!! SALLY STRUTHERS IS HOLDING
FOOD FROM US!!!

The Ethiopians all stand up.

INT. SMALL BUILDING

SALLY STRUTHERS
Oh, oh...

EXT. SOUTH PARK ROLLING HILLS

The two masses collide. An incredible battle ensues.

Blood and gobbling everywhere. Graphic shots of turkeys
getting pummelled with baseball bats and South Parkers being
smothered.

The children, armed, are standing close to Chef.

CHEF
Stay close, children!

Chef guards the children, killing a few attacking turkeys.

The children cheer Chef.

But just then, several turkeys jump on Kenny! Kenny flails
around, but the turkeys hold tight.

More Turkeys jump on Kenny as he jumps around and tries to
get away. But the turkeys overpower him.

Kenny falls to the ground where turkeys pluck out his
eyeballs.

STAN
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!!

KYLE
You bastards!!!

JIMBO
The last three are getting away.
Shoot 'em Ned!

Ned fires on the remaining turkeys.

TOWNSPERSON
We did it!

EXT. SOUTH PARK ROLLING HILLS

Finally, the battle slows as the last of the turkeys is
destroyed.

The townspeople all cheer.

MEPHESTO
(standing over the
turkey carcasses)
My God, what have we done?

CHEF
We've saved Thanksgiving!

MEPHESTO
But all those poor turkeys... They're
all dead!

CHEF
Every turkey dies. Not every turkey
truly lives.

MEPHESTO
As horrible as they were, they felt
like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't
be toying with God's creations...
Perhaps I should just --

CHEF
(We've all heard this
before)
Yeah, yeah, yeah......

The two agents step through the carnage and approach the
kids and Chef. Marvin is not visible.

AGENT 1
Excuse me, sir. We're looking for a
little starving Ethiopian boy who
was accidentally delivered to South
Park instead of Taiko sports watch.

AGENT 2
Have you seen anyone fitting this
description?

BARBRADY
Oh, that could be a hundred kids in
this town, Mister.

But suddenly, Marvin walks up and tugs on the agents pantleg.

AGENT 1
There you are!

AGENT 2
Are you ready to go home now?

Marvin looks at Mr. Garrison, Chef, Barbrady... And then
nods his head quickly.

The agents take Marvin's hand and lead him past the Turkey
carnage.

STAN
Wow... It sucks he has to leave.

KYLE
Yeah, I like him a lot more than
Cartman.

STAN
You know, I think I've learned
something today. It's really easy
not to think of images on TV as real
people, but they are. That's why
it's easy to ignore those commercials.
But people on TV are just as real as
you or I.

KYLE
Yeah...
(Thinking)
And that means that McGyver is a
real person too.

EXT. ETHIOPIA - DAY

Three red cross members are escorting Cartman through the
village. Cartman is eating a pot-pie as he walks.

RED CROSS MEMBER
We're terribly sorry about the mix-
up little boy. We'll get you back
home immediately.

CARTMAN
That's right you will, God dammit!

They walk past the food line.

Cartman breaks into the line.

CARTMAN
Move it, Povs! I'm an AMERICAN!!

EXT. ETHIOPIA - DAY

A large plane lands in the midst of the desolate village.

Little Marvin steps off and is immediately surrounded by his
friends and family.

ETHIOPIAN
Ababa!! Dlook dlook baba raka!

STARVIN' MARVIN
Baba dlook ri nama bam!

As more people gather around, Starvin Marvin gestures to the
plane. Everyone looks on as hundreds of dead Turkeys are
dropped from cargo hold.

Everyone rejoices and cheers.

Several Ethiopians start grabbing the turkeys as others hoist
Marvin up on their shoulders and victoriously march him into
the town --

-- passing, on the way, Sally Struthers is bound and gagged
and tied to a pole.

EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE

It is indeed a POV house; small and cheap.

INT. KENNY'S HOUSE

Kenny's family (mother, father, sister, brother) are gathered
around a humble table. The dishes are set, and in the middle
of the table, on a little serving tray, is the can of green
beans.

The family joins hands in prayer.

KENNY'S FATHER
(Sarcastically)
Lord, on this day of thanks we would
like to extend our DEEPEST gratitude
for this INCREDIBLE BOUNTY of green
beans you have bestowed upon us. And
though you for some reason found it
necessary to take our son from us,
and though you for some reason find
pleasure in watching us suffer...
Still, we give thanks... Amen.

FAMILY
Amen.

The family sits there for a long time.

KENNY'S MOTHER
...Does anybody have a can opener?

Silence.

KENNY'S FATHER
God dammit.

"AN ELEPHANT MAKES LOVE TO A PIG"

by

Matt Stone, Trey Parker & Dan Sterling



EXT. BUSSTOP - MORNING

The boys patiently wait for the bus.

CARTMAN
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black
eye?

STAN
Nothing... I mean, I mean, nowhere.

CARTMAN
Your sister beat you up again, huh?

STAN
NO!

CARTMAN
(laughing)
Yup, your sister kicked your ass.

STAN
She's just pissed off 'cause she got
head gear at the dentist. She's taking
it out on me.

KYLE
Yeah, but that sucks you get your
butt kicked by a girl Stan.

CARTMAN
I would NEVER let a woman kick my
ass! If she tried anything, I'd be
like 'HEY! You get your bitch ass
back in the kitchen and make me some
pie!!'

STAN
My parents don't even believe that
she beats me up. They think she's
all innocent and sweet. But I know
that she's an evil bitch.

CARTMAN
Be a man, Stan. Just say 'HEY WOMAN!
YOU, YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND MAKE
BABIES!'

Stan rolls his eyes.

STAN
Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?

ZOOM OUT to reveal that Kyle has a full-grown African Elephant
on a leash.

KYLE
You mean this one?

STAN
Yeah.

KYLE
He's my new pet elephant.

CARTMAN
Whoa, dude, where'd you get a pet
elephant?

KYLE
I got it mail order from Africa. The
ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks,
but it only took three.

STAN
Wow, that's cool!

KYLE
No it's not cool! My mom won't let
me keep him in the house. She says
he's too big. And that its poop is
bigger than our couch.

CARTMAN
That's why MY mom got ME a pot bellied
pig. 'Cause it's poop is small.

Cartman gestures with his hands.

KENNY
Mmmh mph mhhph mmmam nmmm.

KYLE
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart
like elephants.

The bus pulls up to pick up the kids. The door flies open
and Mrs. Crabtree spots Kyle's Elephant.

MS. CRABTREE
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT IS THAT
THING?!

Kyle and Stan look at each other.

KYLE
(Whispering)
Uh, oh this is the new retarded kid.

The elephant blinks.

MS. CRABTREE
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl...
(Pause)
But you still can't get on. You have
to take the special Ed bus.

WHIP PAN to the special Ed. bus. A little bus filled with
handicapped children (*NOTE -- This is REALLY funny.)

KYLE
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome
anywhere elephant. See ya.

The boys get on the bus, leaving the elephant behind.

CARTMAN
If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd
say 'HEY! YOU GO DO MY LAUNDRY And...

MS. CRABTREE
SIT DOWN, KID!!

CARTMAN
Yes, ma'am.

INT. SCHOOL - DAY

The boys are in class.

MR. GARRISON
And now, children, our friend Mr.
Hat is going to tell us all about
Genetic Engineering.

MR. HAT
That's right, Mr. Garrison, Genetic
Engineering is an exciting new
science. You can splice the DNA from
some animals and make them better.

Kyle seems incredibly intrigued.

KYLE
Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
Yes, Kyle.

KYLE
With genetic engineering, can you
make a elephant smaller?

MR. GARRISON
Well uh... Yes I suppose you could.

You could splice elephant genes with a dog or cat or pot
bellied pig genes.

KYLE
That's it! I'm going to combine my
elephant with a pot-bellied pig and
make... POT BELLIED ELEPHANTS!

The class gasps.

KYLE
They'd be smart like elephants but
small like pigs!

STAN
That'd be cool!

BEBE
I wanna pot-bellied elephant!

PIP
Yes, I'll pay $50 for one.

Terrance, ungroomed and nerdy, pipes up.

TERRANCE
That's stupid!

KYLE
Shut up Terrance, we can genetical
engineer anything we want.

TERRANCE
Oh yea! I bet I can genetically clone
a WHOLE HUMAN BEING before you
crossbreed an elephant and a pig.

KYLE
I bet you can't!

TERRANCE
Watch me plebeian!

MR. GARRISON
Well, spank my ass and call me
Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+
students in a cloning war!

MR. HAT
Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering
let's us correct God's horrible,
horrible mistakes... like German
people. You know you boys might want
to visit the genetic engineering
ranch outside of town for some help.
And you could both use this for your
science fair projects next month.

The bell RINGS. The kids all pile out the door.

KYLE
Genetic engineering ranch?! Sweet!

STAN
Wait, wait, we still need a pig.

KYLE
We can use Cartman's pig.

Cartman's eyes bulge.

CARTMAN
Hey!! You leave Fluffy out of this!

KYLE
We're not gonna hurt her. We just
need some of her blood.

CARTMAN
You're not using any of Fluffy's
blood! Else I'll kick you in the
nuts.

Kyle and Kenny leave.

CARTMAN
Kyle... Kyle! No!

Cartman storms off. Stan starts to follow him but Mr. Garrison
stops him.

MR. GARRISON
Uh, uh Stanley, Can I talk to you
for a minute?

STAN
Okay...

MR. GARRISON
I couldn't help but notice that black
eye you have. Are there problems at
home?

STAN
(hanging his head)
Yes.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, dear... Here, Stanly, sit down,
have some cocoa, and tell your friend
Mr. Hat all about it.

Garrison pours some hot cocoa and hands it to Stan gently.

MR. HAT
I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You
can tell me ANYTHING. Now, who hits
you? Is it your father or your mother?

STAN
Oh, neither, it's my sister.

Mr. Garrison pulls Mr. Hat away.

MR. GARRISON
Your sister? Oh, for Pete's sake,
don't be such a little wuss! Stop
wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy
little foo foo problems... and give
me back my cocoa!

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Stan opens the door slowly. He peeks his head in.

After he sees the coast is clear, he steps in and closes the
door behind him. When he turns around, his big sister, SHELLEY
stands looming over him.

SHELLEY
Hey!

STAN
Hi Shelley.

SHELLEY
Are you looking at my head gear?

STAN
Head gear? What head gear?

SHELLEY
Are you looking at my head gear?

STAN
Oh, gosh. I didn't really notice.

Shelly moves towards Stan.

SHELLEY
You little liar!

STAN
No! I think it looks terrific! It
matches your --

Shelley picks him up and starts whacking him against the
wall. Stan howls! She hurls him toward the basement stairs
and we hear SCREAMS and a THUD-THUD-THUD CRASH.

A bruised, mangled Stan comes crawling up the stairs on his
hands and knees.

Shelly picks him up again and throws him out the front window.
The glass CRASHES and he lands out on the front lawn where
Kyle, Kenny and Cartman stand waiting.

KYLE
Ready to go Stan?

Stan looks up from the broken glass.

STAN
Go where?

KYLE
To the genetical engineering ranch!
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice
its genes with my elephant.

CARTMAN
NOBODY'S SPLICING NOTHING FROM
FLUFFY!!

Kyle helps Stan up.

SHELLEY
I swear I'm going to kill you Stan!

KYLE
Why is your sister so mean to you,
dude?

CARTMAN
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to
kick my ass I'd be all like, 'HEY,
LISTEN MISSY!!! WHY DON'T YOU GO
KNIT ME A SWEATER BEFORE I SLAP YOU
IN THE FACE!!!!'

SHELLEY (O.S.)
Who said that?!

The kids all look toward the house, scared. Cartman points
at Kenny. Kenny's eyes pop.

EXT. GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH - NIGHT

The boys stand outside an ominous building, Kyle with his
elephant and Cartman with his pig. The sign out front reads
"SOUTH PARK GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH." Below, in smaller
letters, it reads "Splicin' n' Dicin' fresh DNA since 1965."

They stare at the building. Thunder and lightning crash.

KYLE
This must be it.

CARTMAN
Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess
we should come back some other time.

KYLE
No Cartman! We're going in there and
splicing Fluffy and my elephant
together.

Fluffy whines a little.

CARTMAN
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them
hurt you.

KYLE
It's just a stupid pig.

STAN
Yeah, quit being such a baby.

CARTMAN
Baby? Well, at least I don't get my
ass kicked by a girl!

Kenny laughs.

STAN
Least I'm not a little pig-#$%@er!

CARTMAN
AY!! I'm taking my pig and screw you
guys, I'm going home. This whole
idea is stupid anyway!

KYLE
What the hell would you know, you
fat sweaty mongoloid!? You never get
higher than a D!

CARTMAN
AY!! Why don't you go back to San
Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!

KYLE
There's no Jews in San Francisco you
retard!!! --

CARTMAN
I'll kick you in the nuts!!

The door suddenly FLIES open and Mr. Mephesto stands there.

MR. MEPHESTO
Can I help you?

The boys reel back in fear from Mephesto's presence.

KYLE
Uh... Yeah... We want to cross breed
an elephant with a pig.

MR. MEPHESTO
Brilliant idea! Huge, elephant-sized
pigs!

KYLE
No no no, we want to make little
potbellied elephants that people can
keep in their houses as pets!

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh, that's an even better idea! Come
on in!

INT. GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH - NIGHT

The boys follow Mephesto through the creepy lab.

MR. MEPHESTO
I'm so pleased that you children are
interested in genetic engineering...

CARTMAN
It's okay fluffy... Nobody's going
to hurt you...

MR. MEPHESTO
It's thanks to the wonder of genetic
engineering that soon there will be
an end to hunger, disease, pollution,
even war. I've created things that
will change the world for the better --
(pointing)
-- For instance, here is a monkey
with four asses.

In a cage is a medium sized monkey with four asses that looks
pissed off.

KYLE
(To Stan)
How does that make the world better?

Stan shrugs. Mephesto shows them more pissed-off animals.

MR. MEPHESTO
And here, of course, is my four-assed
ostrich, and my four-assed mongoose.

The Boys look increasingly confused.

STAN
Do you have anything besides just
animals with four asses?

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh, well, I suppose so... Ah yes,
over here --

Mephesto points to some odd-looking animals.

MR. MEPHESTO
Here I have rats spliced with ducks...
And gorillas spliced with mosquitos.
And here I have rabbits spliced with
fish to make little bunny fish!!

In a tank, four fish with bunny ears swim around. Cartman
looks at them closely and notices that the bunny ears have
little strings attached to them.

CARTMAN
Hey... These bunny ears are tied on
with little strings!

MR. MEPHESTO
And over here is swiss cheese spliced
with chalk... And a beard.

The boys look at the bearded swiss cheese with chalk.

KYLE
Well what about our pot-bellied
elephant?

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh... well I'm sorry children, but
pig and elephant DNA just won't
splice. Haven't you ever heard that
song by Loverboy?

KYLE
Which song is that?

MR. MEPHESTO
"Da'n Do-A, Pig and Elephant D-N-A
Just Won't Splice?".

The kids look at each other.

MR. MEPHESTO
However maybe I could help you add a
few asses to that swine of yours.

CARTMAN
You can keep your hands off of
Fluffy's ass!

Suddenly, Mr. Mephesto grabs a syringe and SHOVES it into
Stan's arm and takes a blood sample.

MR. MEPHESTO
You know it's amazing what we can do
with a little blood sample these
days.

STAN
-- Ow!

Mephesto quickly hides the syringe behind his back.

MR. MEPHESTO
Hmm? What? Oh excuse me.

KYLE
Wait, what are you taking Stan's
blood for?

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I
have some hair please?

Mephesto reaches for Stan's head.

KYLE
Watch out Stan, genetic engineers
are crazy!!!

CARTMAN
Come on Fluffy!!!

The kids scramble out the door, knocking Mephesto down.

1ST COMMERCIAL BREAK

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing shot.

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The boys are on line for food. A little English boy, dressed
in knickers and a hat gets in line behind the boys.

CARTMAN
Oh, I sure am hungry.

PIP
'Allo gentlemen. Any of you blokes
know what's for lunch today? Lunchie
munchies Hmmm?

CARTMAN
Go away, Pip, nobody likes you.

STAN
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip,
anyway?

PIP
Well, my father's family name being
Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip,
my infant tongue --

CARTMAN
God Damnit would you shut the hell
up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass.

STAN
Yeah, go away Pip.

PIP
Right-o.

Pip leaves.

CARTMAN
God, French people piss me off.

TERRANCE
Hey dumbasses!

The Boys turn around to see Terrance and the gang.

TERRANCE
You morons give up on your stupid
science fair project yet?

KYLE
No, we're already half-way done!

TERRANCE
Half-way?
(laughing)
Then all you've got is a stupid pig!

NERDS
Yeah a gay pig too! Stupid gay pig.

KYLE
It's more than you've got.

TERRANCE
Wrong! We've already got our human
clone well underway!

Fosse unveils... a human foot! He places it on the floor and
it starts walking around.

KYLE
Oh my God! They cloned a foot!

CARTMAN
Hey, I'll kick your ass.

TERRANCE
By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole
human being. Good luck with your
stupid little pig.

The nerds walk away, laughing.

CHEF
Hello there, children.

STAN
Hey, Chef.

CHEF
How're you doing?

KYLE & STAN
Bad.

CHEF
Why bad?

KYLE
We need to genetically engineer a
pig and an elephant, but their genes
won't splice.

CHEF
Aw, of course they wont splice
children. Haven't you ever heard
that song by Loverboy. "Da'n Do-A,
Pig and Elephant D-N-A Just Won't
Splice.

The boys look confused.

CHEF
A pig-elephant? Say, now that's a
not a bad idea.

KYLE
I told you guys.

CHEF
Imagine, a pint-sized elephant that
you could keep in the house...
Children, we could make a fortune
with this!

KYLE
You hear that, dudes? We'll be rich!

CHEF
But forget all that genetic
engineerwhoosa-fudge... If you want
to combine a pig and an elephant,
just get them to make sweet love.

CARTMAN
What?!

STAN
I don't think an elephant would make
love to a pig.

CARTMAN
(insulted)
I don't think my pig would wanna
make love to that stupid elephant!!

CHEF
Sure they would... But you're gonna
have to get 'em in the mood.

STAN
Well how do we do that?

CHEF
Do what I do... get 'em good and
drunk.

EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

The boys get off the bus.

STAN
Hey, uh you guys wanna come over to
my house?

KYLE
We've got work to do Stan. I think
it takes a while for an elephant to
get drunk.

STAN
Really? You guys don't want to come
over just for a little bit?

CARTMAN
Why, your sister gonna kick your ass
again?

STAN
Shut up Cartman!

KENNY
Mprh mmprh nmph!

KYLE
Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.

CARTMAN
Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my
ass I'd be like 'HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
STOP DRESSING ME UP LIKE A MAILMAN
AND MAKING ME DANCE FOR YOU WHILE
YOU GO AND SMOKE CRACK IN YOUR BEDROOM
AND HAVE SEX WITH SOME GUY I DON'T
EVEN KNOW ON MY DADS BED!"

Kyle turns around to face Stan.

STAN
Cartman, what the hell are you talking
about?

CARTMAN
I'm just saying you're just a little
wuss. That's all.

KYLE
Stan, you can use family love as a
weapon against Shelley. The next
time she's going to kick your ass
just tell her 'Shelley, you're my
sister and I love you.'

KENNY
Mph mph mph.

STAN
Sick dude! She's my sister!

KYLE
Try it. We'll see you in a while,
we've got to go get Cartman's pig.

CARTMAN
No you don't gotta get Cartman's
pig. You leave Fluffy out of this!

KYLE
Come on Kenny!

Kyle walks off with Kenny.

CARTMAN
Kyle NO!! Seriously!! NO ELEPHANT IS
GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO MY FLUFFY.
Kyle I would kick you in the nuts.

Cartman storms off leaving Stan alone.

STAN
Crap.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Stan timidly enters the living room. She has her head gear
on, and now, in addition, an extremely unsightly back brace.

SHELLEY
Are you staring at my neck brace?

STAN
No. I mean yes, I mean, what neck
brace?

Shelley wraps her hands around Stan's throat, ready to pummel,
when Stan recalls Kyle's advice.

STAN
Shelley, before you beat my face
into a bloody pulp again, I just
want you to know that -- that you're
my sister, and -- I love you.

Shelley's face is taken over by a quizzical look. Stan looks
hopeful, believing he might just have reached her.

Suddenly Shelley's eyebrows turn sharply downward.

THWACK! Shelley bitch-slaps Stan clear across the room, then
starts beating him furiously.

STAN
OW! Someday, Shelley, I'm gonna be
bigger than you, and you're gonna
wish you'd never done any of this to
me.

SHELLEY
You'll never be bigger than me, Stan.
NEVER!

INT. GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH - NIGHT

Mr. Mephesto looks into a giant INCUBATOR.

MR. MEPHESTO
Beautiful! It's absolutely beautiful!!

PULL BACK TO REVEAL a strange larva growing. Through the
larva casing, we can make out a large, embryonic form, clad
in a familiar blue hat with a red pompom.

MR. MEPHESTO
My son, I think we've finally done
it!

PAN across the room to reveal... Terrance, Bill and Fosse!

TERRANCE
Yes we have, dad! My very own HUMAN
CLONE!!!

BILL & FOSSE
Hope he's not a gay clone... Ha Ha.
yeah! That was so stupid, stupid.

The boys high-five.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

The boys and Fluffy are in the same clearing that the UFOs
were in, in ep. 102. The boys are feeding malt liquor to the
elephant from a keg they towed in on a red wagon.

KYLE
Come on, Elephant! Keep drinking!

The elephant tiredly slurps down the beer. It belches and
stumbles a little.

STAN
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to
be to make sweet love to the pig?

The elephant looks at Fluffy. From the elephant's POV:

A blurred image of an ugly pig. The elephant cringes and
quickly starts drinking more beer.

KYLE
Dammit! This is never gonna work!!

Chef happens along.

CHEF
Hello children. I thought I'd check
and see how our little entrepreneurial
venture is going.

KYLE
Rotten! They're both really drunk,
but they won't have sex.

CHEF
Oh, children. You can't just stick a
drunk pig with a drunk elephant and
expect them to do the mattress mambo.
You need to set the mood.

Chef pulls out a huge boom-box with a microphone attached.
He presses play, and very sexy, seductive music kicks in.
Landau and Fluffy prick up their ears.

CHEF
Let me show you boys what I'm talking
about.
(singing)
Tonight is right for love, you know.
I wanna touch you where the lights
don't go -- Tonight is right for
love, love gravy. Expressing love so
sweet, I wanna keep you burning like
a dog in heat. Tonight is right for
love, love gravy. Ladies and gentlemen
Mr. Elton John...

ELTON JOHN
Ooh tonight, all is right, ooh tonight
is right for love, love gravy.

CHEF
Thank you Elton... Tonight is right
for love, love gravy.

MONTAGE: SOUTH PARK HUMPING SEQUENCE

EXT. SOUTH PARK - CONTINUOUS

As we hear Chef's music, we see through a window of a house,
a male and female silhouette gettin' busy.

KYLE
Hey, look! It's working!

Landau drunkenly gets up on top of Fluffy.

CHEF
Now children, gather 'round and watch
the wonders of life, the beauty of
mother nature.

The boys all gather around Chef. From the expressions on
their faces, and the horrible NOISES that emerge, it is
apparent that Landau and Fluffy have started screwing.

STAN
Oh, sick!

CARTMAN
(crying)
Fluffy!!!

CHEF
Hmmm, now I know how all those white
women must have felt.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #2

INT. GENETIC ENGINEERING RANCH

Mr. Mephesto looks in the incubator. The larva is hatching!

MR. MEPHESTO
Ooh! How luscious! Our creature has
come to fruition, boys!

The creature rips through the casing, revealing itself to be
A GIANT, STRANGE, STAN!

TERRANCE
Dad, you're the best!

Mephesto notices that the Big Stan only has one ass.

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh my God! He only has one ass! He's
of no use to me, I'll have to burn
the room!

Big Stan frowns when he hears this. He starts pounding on
the incubator wall. He kicks the incubator door open!

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh no, this entire experiment is
turning out very bad.

BIG STAN
Me Bad?

Big Stan grabs one of the four-assed animals and hurls it
against a wall!

MR. MEPHESTO
Egads!! He's out of control! We'll
have to destroy him.

TERRANCE
But he's our science fair project!

BIG STAN
Bubba chewy chomp!!!

MR. MEPHESTO
He's too dangerous, son!

TERRANCE
(stomping his feet)
But Dad! I wanna a HUMAN CLONE!!

Terrance opens the door and lets Stan free.

MR. MEPHESTO
Son! No!!!

Big Stan immediately crashes through a window. Everybody
watches the Giant Stan run down toward South Park.

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh, son! You've made a horrible
mistake! You've put all the people
of South Park in jeopardy!

TERRANCE
They're all stupid anyway!! Come on
guys, let's go!!

NERDS
Yeah... they're all gay.

The boys take off.

EXT. BARN - MORNING

The boys and Chef watch eagerly, waiting for Landau and Fluffy
to wake up.

CARTMAN
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?

CHEF
Oh, they will. But it's gonna be one
ugly sight!

STAN
I thought you said the wonder of
mother nature was a beautiful thing.

KYLE
Yeah. When does mother nature go
from "beautiful" to "ugly"?

CHEF
Usually about 9:30 in the morning,
children.

Landau groggily opens his eyes and yawns.

CHEF
Uh oh! Here we go!

Landau seems to be okay, until he rolls over and sees the
pig that he slept with last night. He SCREAMS wildly!

CHEF
(very sympathetic)
Yeah, there's nothing worse than
getting all drunk and waking up the
next morning next to a pig, or a big
fat elephant.

Now Fluffy wakes up. When she sees that she is in bed with
an elephant, she slaps her forehead with her little hoof and
sighs.

KYLE
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?

CHEF
Well, boys, we might not know that
for a couple of days.

KYLE
A couple of days? But Terrance is
going to have his human clone by
tomorrow!

CARTMAN
Well good job Einstein! Why don't we
just build a rocket in the mean time?!

Kyle WHACKS Cartman.

Mr. Mephesto appears suddenly.

MR. MEPHESTO
Oh thank Bhudda, I've found you boys.
You must tell me, have you seen
anything odd lately?

STAN
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with
a pig.

MR. MEPHESTO
No, no I said "odd."

CHEF
Hey, you're that crazy cracker from
up on the hill.

MR. MEPHESTO
Sir! If making mutant animals spliced
with humans is crazy, then... uh...
never mind.

Chef takes this in for a moment, then

MR. MEPHESTO
I'm afraid there's been a bit of an
incident at the ranch. You see, I've
created a large, mutant clone of
that little boy there, and he's broken
free.

The kids eyes open wide!

KENNY
Mph mph mmph.

STAN
A big mutant version of me?!

KYLE
Is he bigger than a regular clone?!

MR. MEPHESTO
He's terribly dangerous. His brain
is identical to yours. I need you to
help me find him!

Stan has a huge smile on his face.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

Big mutant Stan is wreaking havoc in downtown South Park.

He's destroying buildings. People run and scream in terror.
Big Stan picks up a car and tosses it like a football. Mr.
Garrison comes around a corner.

MR. GARRISON
Stan, are you wearing a different
hat?

BIG STAN
Cha waaha waah.

The Stan thing grabs Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
HEY! I know a certain young man who
is itching for detention!

BIG STAN
Haa Cheww weee.

Big Stan throws Mr. Garrison through Jimbo's Gun shop window.

Meanwhile, Stan leads the other boys in the search for Big
Stan.

STAN
How big do you think he is? I bet he
weighs FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS!

KYLE
Come on, Stan! Don't you even know
where you would go?

KENNY
(pointing)
Mmph! Mpm nmnm!

KYLE
Oh my God!

The boys see Big Stan carrying a few innocent people. He
disappears around a corner.

INT. T.V SET - DAY

NEWSMAN
It appears that the horrible,
destructive creature is actually
eight year old Stan Marsh of South
Park.

A picture of innocent little Stan is put up.

NEWSMAN
When asked why he was wreaking such
havoc on his home town, the little
boy replied simply 'Me Stan, bu chomp
ba chewy chomp ba chewy chomp'...
Back to you in the studio.

T.V. ANCHOR
Thanks Tom, police are requesting
that if you see this little eight
year old boy, you immediately kill
him and burn his body. That's all
for now.

NARRATOR
And now back to Jesus and Pals!!

JESUS
Yea, the way is paved with gold for
ye who seek truth and --

Suddenly, evil Stan rips through the set.

BIG STAN
Ba chomp Ba chewy chomp.

JESUS
Jesus!

EVIL STAN
BA CHOMP!! BA CHEWY CHOMP!!

Stan tears the set apart.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

Officer Barbrady directs traffic amidst the chaos. The kids
run up to him.

STAN
Officer Barbrady! My evil genetic
clone is destroying the town! We
have to find him!

OFFICER BARBRADY
You boys have been watching the X
files too much. There's no such thing
as --

Suddenly, the evil Stan grabs Barbrady by the throat and
tosses him into Starks' Pond.

KYLE
Come on! Let's go!

Suddenly, Jimbo comes up behind Stan and grabs his shoulder.

JIMBO
There you are! Stanly, you tore up
my entire gun shop! You better have
a GOOD explanation for this Mister!

STAN
It wasn't me, Uncle Jimbo, it was my
evil genetic clone.

Mr. Garrison appears.

MR. GARRISON
Stanly! What the hell has gotten
into you? You have got severe
lunchroom duty Mister!

JIMBO
I'm gonna have a word with your father
Stanley.

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, you wait 'till your father
hears about this.

KYLE
Wait Stan! There he goes!

Evil Stan starts to walks away.

STAN
STOP!!

The Stan thing turns and looks at Stan oddly.

BIG STAN
Bubba chomp...

KYLE
He recognizes you, dude.

STAN
That's good, that's good dude, just
calm down.

Evil Stan now turns his head. He rests and sits down.

BIG STAN
Ba chewy chomp.

KYLE
What should we do with him?

Stan smiles.

STAN
Stan... How would you like to go
home and meet your sister?

Evil Stan smiles.

BIG STAN
Haa Ba Chew

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

STAN
(to Big Stan)
So remember, Shelley's the one with
a big wire coming out of her mouth
and a metal plate on her back. When
you see Shelley, KICK HER ASS. Shelley
bad! Shelley very bad!!

Big Stan's wide eyes turn to extreme fear.

BIG STAN
Me bad?

He thinks Stan is calling him bad. He goes berserk! Big Stan
starts wrecking the place! He knocks over book cases, the
china cabinet, tables, chairs.

STAN
No! SHELLY Bad! YOU GOOD!!

KYLE
He's tearing up the house. Stop him!!!

Kenny lunges at Big Stan, but Big Stan sends him flying
through the air... and right into the large microwave.

The door slams shut and the power goes on.

Big Stan continues to rip the place to shreds. All the boys
are SHOUTING and jumping on him, but he keeps throwing them
off, sending them in all directions.

Finally, Big Stan turns around and finds himself face to
face with Shelley.

SHELLEY
What the hell do you want?

They size each other up for a second and then Shelley hauls
off and belts him with overwhelming force. Big Stan goes
down.

BIG STAN
Ba chewy chewy chomp... Uh.

Mr. Mephesto rushes in.

MR. MEPHESTO
Boys, boys, I'm lusciously sorry for
everything!

Terrance, Bill and Fosse burst in.

TERRANCE
Hey! They've got our clone! He belongs
to us!

MR. MEPHESTO
No, son! This beast is a disgrace to
genetic engineers everywhere.
(to the Boys)
Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such
inconvenience. I tried to play God
and I failed --

Mr. Mephesto pulls out a gun and SHOOTS a hole right through
Big Stan's head! The blood splatters in Terrance's face. Big
Stan falls to the floor dead.

TERRANCE
Daddy! NOOOOOOO!!!

MR. MEPHESTO
All I've ever wanted was to
genetically engineer something useful.
(starting to weep)
But I've failed. Perhaps we shouldn't
be toying with God's creations.
Perhaps we should just leave nature
alone to it's simple one assed
schematics.

Mephesto starts to sob.

TERRANCE
You cheating bastards! This isn't
over! Just wait until tomorrow!!

The nerds leave. Utterly depressed, Mephesto follows.

The microwave dings and a crispy, moist Kenny falls out and
onto the floor with a squish.

KYLE
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
(shaking his fist at
the microwave)
You bastard!!

STAN
Mom and Dad are home. My house is a
disaster. You guys gotta help me!!!

CARTMAN
I ain't helping crap! I wanna eat
some pie!

STAN
You can't just leave me here alone!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah? Watch me!

KYLE
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if
Cartman's pig is pregnant or not.
See ya!

Kyle and Cartman bolt.

STAN
Thanks a lot!!!

SHELLEY
Oh boy, you are gonna GET IT now!!!

Stan looks through the window. He looks back in total shock.

Shelley approaches Stan menacingly. Stan starts to sob.

STAN
It isn't fair! Everybody hates me!
The whole town wants me killed!
(Crying)
Mom and Dad are gonna send me away!

Shelley stops in her tracks and watches her pitiful brother
cry.

STAN
I don't wanna be sent away! I want
to stay here! WAAAGGHH!!!

The door opens. In walk Stan's mild-mannered parents.

STAN'S DAD
STANLY!! WHAT IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING?!

STAN'S MOM
EVERYBODY IN TOWN IS UPSET WITH YOU
YOUNG MAN! WHAT'S GOING ON?! ARE YOU
ON DRUGS?!

The parents approach Stan, but Shelley steps in their way.

SHELLEY
It's not Stan's fault.

DAD
Huh?

SHELLEY
It wasn't Stan, he was... he was
with me the whole time.

Stan looks utterly shocked.

DAD
Oh... Well, Stan we're... We're sorry
we jumped to conclusions...

MOM
Oh honey, please forgive us son.

The parents hug Stan and walk away. Stan is still in shock.

Finally, Stan snaps out of his daze.

STAN
Shelley, you -- you saved my life!

Shelley stares blankly at Stan.

STAN
And yet, you've done so much more
than that. Today, you've taught me
the meaning of family.

Shelley continues to stare blankly at Stan.

STAN
Sure, families don't always get along.
But when the forces of evil descend
upon us, we conquer them. By sticking
together.

Shelley continues to stare. Stan goes to hug his sister.

SOCK! Shelley decks Stan right in the mouth. She proceeds to
give him the beating of a life time.

Rats pull Kenny apart.

FADE OUT:

END OF ACT II

EPILOGUE

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Establishing shot.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

MR. GARRISON
Everyone, let's give Casey and his
weed a big hand. Okay, Kyle we're
ready to see your science project.

KYLE
Well, our pig hasn't given birth
yet, but she should any time now.

MR. GARRISON
Oh well then I guess you get an F.

Okay Terrance I know the class can hardly wait to see your
science fair project.

TERRANCE
Thank you Mr. Garrison.

Fosse and Bill wheel in a large cage covered by a cloth.

TERRANCE
Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students.
For our science fair project, Bill,
Fosse and I have spawned a creature
genetically far superior to man. I
present to you --

Fosse and Bill rip away the cloth.

TERRANCE
...The five-assed monkey!

Inside the cage is the formerly four-assed monkey, now with
a fifth ass. The ape now looks absolutely furious.

Everyone APPLAUDS. Terrance and the boys bow.

MR. GARRISON
Oh Mr. Hat isn't it beautiful.

KYLE
Wait, Wait, the pig just gave birth,
it had a baby!!!

Cartman and Kyle carry in a large cage, but we can't quite
see what's inside. The class gathers around to look. Many
"Oohs" and "Wow's are heard.

KIDS
What's it look like?

KYLE
Does it look like a pig or an
elephant?

CARTMAN
Hey, it kinda looks like Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, gee. Isn't that an amazing
coincidence? What are the odds of
that?

STAN
Hmmn!

MR. GARRISON
You boys get first prize!

Fluffy stands proud of her offspring. Cartman looks down at
her with a little glow around his head.

CARTMAN
That'll do pig.

"CARTMAN'S INCREDIBLE GIFT"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Cartman's yard, side of the house, day. The fourth grade boys
are gathered there for some reason]

CLYDE
I don't know, that looks pretty high
up.

BUTTERS
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start
lower.

STAN
Dude, I really don't think it's smart,
Cartman.

CARTMAN
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.


STAN
It's not gonna work; just come down
from there.

CARTMAN
...Geez, this looks a lot higher from
up here.

KYLE
What's going on?

STAN
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his
roof.

KYLE
Do it! Do it!

CARTMAN
I'm gonna.

CRAIG
I wouldn't if I were you.

TOKEN
Those wings don't look very strong.


KYLE
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure
it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay Cartman!
Fly fly fly!

CARTMAN
Okay, here we go.  Since the days of
Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight.
On this historic day, let us go on to


KYLE
Awww, go on and do it already!

CARTAMN
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this
historic day, we remember the Wright
Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose
dreams and visions inspired generations.


STAN
He's not gonna do it.

CARTMAN
And now, again, one man's vision ushers
in a new era of aerial travel, proving
the power of imagination and intellect.
The magic... of flight!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Cartman is in a recovery room with
bruises on his face and a black left eye. The medical staff attends
him. Outside, Mrs. Cartman appears and rushes in to see Cartman]


LIANE
Oh my God! Eric! Eric,  Mommy's here.
Sweetie?  Oh what's wrong with him?


DR. KELS
I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly
stupid. He thought he could fly with
cardboard wings. The stupidity is so
severe that it caused a fall, which
has... put him into a deep coma.

LIANE
Coma... My God, for- for how long?


DR. KELS
There's no telling. He may never recover.
We'll just have to wait. And see.


[Hell's Pass, some time later. The camera pans down back onto
Cartman, who is now covered in facial hair and a bandage around
his head.]

SINGERS
Seasons change, time passes by.

As the weeks become the months become the years.

CARTMAN
Eugh...

LIANE
Oh my... Doctor!  He's awake!

CARTMAN
Wheh? Where am I?

LIANE
Oh, you've finally come back! It's a
miracle!

DR. KELS
You're at the hospital, Eric. You've...
been in a coma for some time.

CARTMAN
Coma... How long?

DR. KELS
It's been two days. Nurse, you can remove
his face-warmer now.

NURSE
Yse, Doctor.

DR. KELS
Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head
traume. Your road to recovery will be
long and arduous. At least another two
days.

SINGERS
Seasons change, time passes by.

As the weeks become the months become the years.

LIANE
You're doing so much better, muffin.


CARTMAN
Why the hell do I have to share my room
with other patients? This is bullcrap!


LIANE
Oh, you're sounding just like your old
self again.

DR. KELS
I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing
we could do.

DETECTIVE
Damnit! Another murder victim! For three
years the Left-Hand killer has been
at large and I've exhausted every lead!
Maybe... I just don't have what it takes
to be a cop anymore.

MURPHY
We'd better get back to the station,
sir.

CARTMAN
Good, because you assholes have kept
me up for three hours!

DETECTIVE
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on
a second, where are, where are my car
keys?

CARTMAN
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!


DETECTIVE
Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffereed
head trauma?

DR. KELS
Yes, it was pretty severe.

MURPHY
What is it, Lou?

LOU
I've... heard cases where people suffering
head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.


MURPHY
Aw, come on, sir.

LOU
I know it's ridiculous , but I'm gonna
explore every possibility I can.  Hello,
young man, could we have a quick word
with you?

CARTMAN
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in
any minute with my lunch.

NURSE 2
Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time.

LOU
Young man, how did you know the nurse
was gonna walk in just now?

CARTMAN
I don't know, I just knew it.  Aww man,
this smells like meatloaf. Again?!


NURSE 2
Yep, meatload again.

MURPHY
Jesus, how did he...?

LOU
Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's
chance in hell but...  we were wondering
if you could come down and see if your...
new powers could help us catch the killer.


LIANE
His new... powers?

[Stark's Pond, newly restored from the demolished Wall*Mart,
much bigger than it was before, night. A crime scene at the docks
is shown, complete with boat floating around]

FEMALE DETECTIVE
All right, make sure you get pictures
of everything in this crime scene.


OFFICER 1
Who's the kid?

OFFICER 2
He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.


OFFICER 1
Aw Christ.

LOU
This is... where the body was found.
Multiple stab wounds, just like all
the others.

CARTMAN
How come the outline is missing its
hand?

MURPHY
The killer always cuts off the left
hand of his victim, and keeps it as
a trophy.

LOU
Stand back, give him room!  Come on,
kid, concentrate! What do you see in
your mind?

[Cartman begins to concentrate and his eyes begin to twitch.
First he sees a muffing with chocolate topping and sprinkles,
then powdered doughnuts, then a cup of vanilla ice cream - with
sprinkles being added]

CARTMAN
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate
sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...
He ... He's taking the top of one and...
...and he puts it together to make
Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream,
and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!


LOU
Jesus Christ!

MURPHY
Sir?

LOU
Tom Johannsen, the owner of the ice
cream shop!

[Mr. Johansen's house, night. The detectives ring his doorbell
and he answers]

MR. JOHANSEN
Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.

LOU
Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick
word with you?

MR. JOHANSEN
Wuhsure, come on in.  I'm afraid the
house is a little bit of a disaster
area since I have

LOU
Get him!  Code 6! Code 6!

OFFICER 3
Use the taser! Use the taser!

OFFICER 4
Do it again!

[Mr. Johansen's house outside, front. Police cars and vans have
gathered outside and the siren lights are still rotating]

OFFICER 5
He put up a hell of a fight, but we
got him!

MR. JOHANSEN
Why? Why??

LOU
Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped
the biggest killer in South Park history.


MURPHY
We would give you a reward, but I guess
that knowing the people of South Park
are safe again is reward enough.

CARTMAN
Guess again.

MURPHY
All right, here's a hundred dollars.


CARTMAN
Wow!

LOU
His powers are uncanny. Take good care
of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses
his powers for good.

LIANE
Oh he will. My little poopsiekins is
a very good little boy.

[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Cartman runs
down the hall dressed in a bath robe and using a cane]

CARTMAN
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have
super-awesome powers. You don't.

KYLE
Cartman, what did you do?!

CARTMAN
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my
new psychic abilities to catch the serial
killer. And I made a hundred bucks!


KYLE
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop!
He wasn't a killer and you know it!


CARTMAN
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies
when I closed my eyes?

KYLE
Because you're a fucking fatass, that's
why?!

CARTMAN
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!

KYLE
You don't have any powers!

CARTMAN
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make
your head explode with a single thoght!


BUTTERS
Wuh be careful, Kyle.

KYLE
He can't do crap!

CARTMAN
Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at!


LOU
There he is! Hey, Eric!  We've got a
little problem.

CARTMAN
What?

LOU
While the ice-cream store owner was
in jail, another murder was commited.


MURPHY
This body also had a missing hand and
a bowl of corn flakes next to it!


LOU
Which can only mean one thing!

KYLE
Ha! You see?!

LOU
That a copycat killer is on the loose!
We need your psychic abilities to catch
this new guy right away!

KYLE
What?!

MURPHY
We'll pay you up front this time! We've
gotta catch this new guy before he kills
again.

CARTMAN
I'm afraid that my powers... are not
for sale. ...And by that I mean they
absolutely are for sale. Let's go!


[Field report]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside
of town where police have discovered
the first victim of the serial copycat
killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman
is now arriving on the scene.

[The crime scene]

KYLE
This is fuckin' ridiculous!

LOU
Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing
anything?

CARTMAN
No. Nothing.

OFFICER 6
Maybe his powers have left him.

OFFICER 7
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Wait a minute.  Fried chicken. It's
tender and it's fresh.  There's maple
syrup... Maple syrup's being put on
the chicken.

KYLE
What the hell is wrong with these people?!


WEIRD MAN
They're never gonna catch the serial
killer. He's too smart. Do you want
to see my cotton panties?

KYLE
Hey! What about this guy?!

MURPHY
Quiet! He's havin' a vision!

CARTMAN
It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's
a fried chicken sundae.

WEIRD MAN
"Junior, what are you doing out?" I'm
sorry, Mother. "You come home rigtht
now and have sex with me!" No, Mommy!


KYLE
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy
is?!

LOU
I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll
have you arrested for interfering with
the law!

[The News 4 logo and screen come up on a TV]

ANNOUNCER
This is Park County News 4, with your
host, Jim Brown-ish

JIM BROWN
The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand
killer has been arrested. Police used
the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind
psychic detective. At the crime scene,
the young psychic had visions flash
before his mind, and the police immiedately
arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried
Chicken. The young man's visions were
so astounding that other police departments
have sought out his help.

[Cartman's house, day. He's in his room counting the money he's
made from his psychic work]

CARTMAN
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my
hands. *clap* *clap* If I'm happy and
I know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap*


LIANE
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people
here to see you.

CARTMAN
More people need to make use of my phenomenal
gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.


LIANE
Ah, no, these people claim that they
are the "real" psychic detectives.


[Living room, moments later. Liane and Cartman enter]

FEMALE PSYCHIC 1
So, you are the little boy who's been
taking all our work?!

LIANE
Oooh, I'll go make some tea.

MALE PSYCHIC 1
Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go
through the proper channels to become
a psychic detective like we all did.


OTHER PSYCHICS
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Proper channels?

MALE PSYCHIC 2
You were supposed to fill out the form
on the back of the comic book and pay
the twenty five dollar fee for the degree
from the Psychic Detective School.


CARTMAN
I was given my gift from a tragic accident.
I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective
School.

MALE PSYCHIC 1
Well you just can't say you're a psychic
detective, you have to use the ad in
the comic book!

FEMALE PSYCHIC 1
You must pay the twenty five dollar
fee and give us ten percent of yoru
earnings!

CARTMAN
Ten percent my balls, get lost!

FEMALE PSYCHIC 1
Very well, then you give us no choice.
Roger?

[Roger steps out from behind the sofa and prepares to battle
Cartman psychically. Cartman simply observes, then responds.
He and Roger battle with sound effects and hand gestures]

FEMALE PSYCHIC 1
All right everyone!

LIANE
Oh, poopsies, what's going on?

CARTMAN
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic
battle of minds!

LIANE
O-o-o-o-o-oh!

FEMALE PSYCHIC 1
Enough!  We are ...obviously quite evenly
matched. I guess this will have to be
settled in court.

CARTMAN
In court?

FEMALE PSYCHIC 1
We brought a class-action lawsuit against
you! We'll see you before the judge
tomorrow!

LIANE
Is it over?

[A camera shutter is heard and a picture of Ms. Crabtree appears,
with blood next to her left cheek. It looks like someone shot
her through the side of the head and her left hand is missing.
A detectuve continues taking pictures]

MURPHY
Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, busdriver
for the elementary school. She was considered
an ancillary character, one the fans
wouldn't miss much.

LOU
Jesus Christ! Cause of death?

MURPHY
Same MO, sir. Multiple stab wounds,
left hand cut off and missing.

LOU
So you're telling me somebody new is
now copying the crimes of the copycat
killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!
Every time I put a killer behind bars,
another guy just steps in and takes
his place! What am I doing wrong?!


KYLE
Excuse me, sir? I think I know who
did this. We saw this guy at the last
crime scene, and, and you know how serial
killers sometimes return to the scene
of the crime? Well, I followed this
guy to his house, and when he left again,
I collected some fingerprints and did
a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty
sure he's your man.

LOU
How do you know?? Are you psychic??


KYLE
No.

LOU
Look, kid, don't waste my time with
your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus!
I have to find this new killer now!
I owe it to that victim over there!
I know she hadn't been in any recent
episodes, but DAMNIT she deserved better
than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta
talk to Eric Cartman again!

KYLE
Why won't anybody listen to me?!

KENNY
(Don't take it personally, Kyle)

KYLE
I AM taking it personally because Cartman
is a retard! Just because he hit his
head and went into a coma doesn't mean
he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people
to listen to me, I just have to be as
stupid as Cartman.

[Kyle's house, later. Kyle is standing at the edge of the roof
at the side of his house, sporting his own cardboard wings]


STAN
Dude, I really don't think that's a
good idea!

TOKEN
There has to be another way!

KYLE
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!


BUTTERS
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the
sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and
you'll crash into the ocean.

STAN
Butters, Goddamnit.

KYLE
All right, here we go.  Since the days
of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight.
On this historic day we rerme- aw screw
it!

STAN
Call an ambulance.

[Channel 4 News. A picture of handcuffs is shown, with "ARRESTS
MADE" above it]

JIM BROWN
Multiple arrests were made today for
the murder of Hillary Neals. Police
raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m.,
where seven psychic detectives were
staying.  The psychic detectives' horrible
crime was found out by psychic detective
Eric Cartman , who is now the only psychic
not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.


[Cartman watches the news from the sofa in the living room at
his house]

CARTMAN
Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come
in, Kyle!  Who are you?

WEIRD MAN
You, you give everyone else credit for
my work, because you fail to see my
greatness.

CARTMAN
... 'K. Sweet.

WEIRD MAN
Because of you, nobody knows the extent
of my deeds.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.
Mom, there's some homeless guy here.
Make him go away.

[Next scene is an unknown place. Cartman is strapped down to
a wheelchair. He awakens and struggles a bit]

CARTMAN
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on??

WEIRD MAN
You are obviously a big fan of my work.


CARTMAN
I don't even know you dude!

WEIRD MAN
But I am the serial killer! The one
whose rightful place in history you
have smirched!

CARTMAN
Oh Jesus.

WEIRD MAN
And now you will have a place of honor,
as my nineteenth victim.

CARTMAN
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please,
I'll give you anything you want!

WEIRD MAN
Before you die, let me show you the
things that I've done, so you will understand
the breadth of my transformation!  This...
is me at the grand canyon.  Do you see?
This is me at Mount Rushmore  Do you
see?

CARTMAN
Heheh.

WEIRD MAN
Do you see??

CARTMAN
Yes yes, I see!

WEIRD MAN
Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio.
This was just outside of the gift shop.
Do you see??

CARTMAN
AAAAAAAH!

[Park County Police Station, night]

LOU
Damnit! Damnit all to hell! They just
found another body! That means a fifth
copycat killer is on the loose! Where's
my psychic?!

FEMALE DETECTIVE
Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says
her son hasn't been home for a couple
of hours.

OFFICER 8
Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital!
He says another little boy just awoke
from a coma, and is having psychic visions!


SGT. LOU
Let's go!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, later. Dr. Kels leads them into the recovery
room]

DR. KELS
This is the young man here. He was in
a coma for over sixteen hours.

SGT. LOU
Doctor, could you remove his face warmer?
We'd like to speak with him.

DR. KELS
Of course. Nurse?

SGT. LOU
Young man, the doctor said you've had
some... visions about our newest murder?


KYLE
I see... a man... with a baseball cap.
He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing
it all flash before my eyes! The guy's
name is Michael Deets, and he lives
at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually
there between seven and eleven p.m.


SGT. LOU
What do you think, Mitch?

MURPHY
I don't know. How do we know this kid
is really psychic? I mean, this boy
is certainly no Eric Cartman.

SGT. LOU
All right, we'll check this Deets guy
out. But let's use that one thing that
we never use.

MURPHY
...Sir?

SGT. LOU
You know, what's that one thing that
starts with an R that we never use?


MURPHY
...Restraint?

SGT. LOU
Yeah yeah, restraint. We'll check this
guy out, but let's use some restraint.


[Mr. Deets' basement. He's still showing Cartman his slides]


MR. DEETS
Look! Look at the things I've done!
Here I am at Yellowstone National Park!
Do you see?! Here are pictures of my
trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days.
Do you see?!

CARTMAN
Oh my God! I'm so bored! Somebody help
me!

SGT. LOU
Good evening, sir. We're Park County
detectives. We were just wondering if
we could take a quick look around your
house, Misterrr...

MR. DEETS
God.

SGT. LOU
Well Mr. God, it won't take but a second;
it might help us with an investigation.


CARTMAN
(Hey! Come over here!)

SGT. LOU
I see you like cutting the eyes out
of photos of women. My son is a big
fan of that too.

MURPHY
Sarge! In here!

SGT. LOU
Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest
that guy!  Whoawhoawaitwaitheywait wait
yo! Oh wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.


MURPHY
Sir?

SGT. LOU
This isn't the guy. The serial killer
always cuts off the victims' left hands.


MURPHY
Right.

SGT. LOU
Well those aren't left hands.  See,
on your left hand, the thumb faces to
the left. Those are all right hands.


MURPHY
Ohhh.

SGT. LOU
Nope, this isn't our man.  We're sorry,
Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your
time.

CARTMAN
(Hey! Get me out of here!)

MURPHY
Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that
guy had a bunch of hands on his wall.
Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was
a killer.

SGT. LOU
Yeah... Amazing coincidence...

MURPHY
Heh- sir?

SGT. LOU
Call it police intuition, but sonethin'
in there just didn't feel right.  Wait
a minute.

MURPHY
Sarge...  What is it?

SGT. LOU
I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run
some tests.

[Park County Police Station, night. Montage. Lou types away at
his computer, then analyzes his left hand again, then returns
to the keyboard. He then goes to the lab and looks over his notes.
Next to him are two hands, one right and one left. He rotates
the right hand so both thumbs point to the left, from his POV,
then takes more notes. He develops some pictures in the darkroom
and finds matching hands. He works with a 3D model drawing with
another computer, then traces his left hand on a wall and takes
measurements. He returns to the lab and works with some chemicals.
Next he chops some firewood into smaller chunks. Next he's at
a gym jumping rope. Next he's at a beach far from South Park
playing volleyball with some women. Next he's repairing the body
of a car with a welding torch...]

SGT. LOU
Murphy, do you remember what I was
supposed to be doing?

MURPHY
Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands,
sir? Uh for the serial killer?

SGT. LOU
Oh right! The hands! Right!

[Again he goes to his computer and types awaym then he's back
at the lab taking pictures of the two fake hands there, then
makes silhouettes of a dog, then models another hand in the computer
and gets a match]

SGT. LOU
Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna
believe this.

[Mr. Deets' house, basement. Mr. Deets has resumed showing his
pictures to Cartman. A picture of him at Ocean World's Splash
Zone is shown, then a blank. He turns the projector off]

MR. DEETS
That's it, no more pictures.  Time to
die.

CARTMAN
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people
credit for your killings. Ahah, it was,
it was very wrong for me to lie about
the other psychics and get them arrested.


MR. DEETS
Your hand will be one with the others.


CARTMAN
Please just let me go! Ah I'm gonna
tell everyone I'm not really psychic!
I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't
wanna-  I don't wanna have to use my
psychic mind missile on you!

SGT. LOU
Hold it right there, killer!

CARTMAN
You got here just in time. He was gonna
kill me because he was insanely jealous
of my incredible psychic ability.


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The detectives, the psychics, Cartman,
Stan, and Kenny]

SGT. LOU
Well young man, you did an amazing thing.
Not only did your psychic visions help
us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent
people are out of jail.

MALE PSYCHIC 3
Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.

FEMALE PSYCHIC
Yes, thanks.

MURPHY
You're certainly a better psychic then
Eric.

KYLE
No, don't you see? Cartman never had
psychic visions. And neither do these
people. The plain simple truth is that
nobody is psychic. There's a logical
explanation for every psychic story
you've ever heard.

MURPHY
Do you think that's true?

SGT. LOU
It must be true. The kid is psychic.
But I don't suppose it really matters
much. Because in the end, the way I
caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned
police work. Come on, Murphy.

FEMALE PSYCHIC
Well young man, I guess that just leaves
one score to settle.

CARTMAN
You can't hurt me.

MALE PSYCHIC 1
Then let this be our final battle!


KYLE
Just stop it!  Stoopp iitt!!  There's
a logical explanation for that.

"AWESOM-O"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Butters' house, day. Butters is in the living room eating some
soup. The doorbell rings. Butters stops and looks at the door.
He rises and opens it, and sees a large wooden crate waiting
on the porch]

BUTTERS
What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!
"To Butters Stotch."  Oh boy! It's
for me! It's for me!!  Who is it from?
"Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."  Wow!
A package for me from Japan!!  Wow,
what can it be? My birthday isn't until
September 11th.  Oh boy! I've never
gotten a package this big! I've always
wanted to have a huge package.

CARTMAN
Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.


BUTTERS
Whoa...

CARTMAN
I have been sent from Japan to serve
as your personal robot.

BUTTERS
You... you're my robot?

CARTMAN
Yes. I will be your new best friend.


BUTTERS
Oh wow!

[Moments later, Butters has Cartman sitting on his bed. Butters
goes to his desk and makes a few calls.]

BUTTERS
Yep. That's right. He's a real live
robot. He can walk and talk and everything.
You're like the fourth kid I told already.
Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and
I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're
all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came
into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best
friend a guy could have.

CARTMAN
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In face,
you should tell AWESOM-O all your most
personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not
make fun of you or tell your secrets
to other people and stuff.

BUTTERS
Hey yeah! Well I can tell you anything,
huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one,
I have what's called a heziated colon,
which means I sometime can't control
my sphincter.

CARTMAN
Could be.

BUTTERS
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes
I poop my pants, so I have to wear a
diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?


CARTMAN
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.


BUTTERS
Well, I have to take medicine for it
every day. It's a little suppository
I have to ...put up my rectom.

CARTMAN
That, that's very interesting. Tell
AWESOM-O more secrets.

BUTTERS
Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents
don't know, but sometimes I get picked
on by this one kid at school; his name
is Eric Cartman, and he always tries
to play jokes on me and stuff.

CARTMAN
Oh, really?

BUTTERS
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor
had hit the earth, and convinced me
to stay down in a bomb shelter for three
days.

CARTMAN
Heh. Wow, that sucks.

BUTTERS
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended
to be me on the phone to my dad and
called him a pussy, so my dad came home
and beat me.

CARTMAN
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is
pretty smart.

BUTTERS
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole.
And he's never gonna play on me ever
again!

CARTMAN
Really? You think so? Well, guess what,
Butters. I have a surprise for you.


BUTTERS
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again!
'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is
that I know one of his secrets!

CARTMAN
What?

BUTTERS
When Cartman is playing all alone in
his backyard, he likes to dress up like
Britney Spears and pretend he's her!
Hi sings and dances around with a life-sized
cutout of Justin Timberlake.

CARTMAN
You saw that?

BUTTERS
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!


CARTMAN
Nuh uh.

BUTTERS
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even
him making out with the Justin Timberlake
cutout!

CARTMAN
No way.

BUTTERS
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with
me again, I'm gonna show that video
to everybody! Then I'll lhave my revenge,
boy howdy!

CARTMAN
...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?


BUTTERS
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere.
Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?


CARTMAN
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O
the videotape?

BUTTERS
How come?

CARTMAN
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like,
back it up for you, and make copies
and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.

BUTTERS
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come
on! I have a lot of things to teach
you.

CARTMAN
Oh, son of a bitch!

[Montage. Butters tosses a basketball with Cartman on the front
lawn. Cartman, as AWESOM-O, can't catch it]

BUTTERS
Hey there have you heard about my robot
friend?

[they're walking along in a meadow. Butters is telling him a
story]

He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.

He's a cyberwired bundle of joy.

[Butters has AWESOM-O take shots at a basketball hoop. The shot
is good and Butters is pleased]

My robot friend.

[Stan, Kyle and Kenny observe nearby from behind a bush. They're
dismayed at what they see. Stan grabs his nose and squeezes his
eyes shut, then walks off. Kyle and Kenny follow]

I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.

[jumps in a puddle, then has AWESOM-O do the same. Butters giggles]


He's smart as can be and emotion-free

[washes dishes while AWESOM-O dries them, then they go see "The
Prince and Me." They exit, with Butters skipping beside AWESOM-O.
Butters loved the movie]

And he's computin' his way to my heart.

My robot friend.

[At a restaurant two burgers reach Butters' table. He gets one,
he motions to the waiter that AWESOM-O gets the other one. The
waiter looks confused, then walks away with the other burger]


My robot friend.

[Butters has AWESOM-O pull him along in a red wagon]

My robot friend.

[they walk into a sunset together]

My robot ...friend.

[the scene ends]

[Butters' hosue, living room. His dad reads the newspaper, his
mom arrives with coffee and cookies and sets them down on the
coffee table]

LINDA
Ohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters
and his friend Eric playing Robot.


CHRIS
Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative.
Leave it to them to find a fun way to
do the dishes.

BUTTERS
That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry
all my laundry in one trip!

LINDA
Ah, Buttters, it's getting late. You
should be getting ready for bed soon.


BUTTERS
Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.


LINDA
Oh, is your little robot friend staying
the night?

BUTTERS
Well of course he is. He's my robot,
ain't he?

LINDA
That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?


CARTMAN
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.

BUTTERS
Yup! Don't you know nothin' about robot?
Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry
away!

LINDA
Aww, that's just adorable.

CHRIS
It's good to see Butters finally have
a friend that wants to stay over.


[The Stotch bathroom. Butters is brushing his teeth, AWESOM-O
stands next to him]

BUTTERS
I like to brush my teeth in the morning
and at night. The teeth won't mind ..


CARTMAN
Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like
this.  Butters, remember when you said
you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed
like Britney Spears?

BUTTERS
Oh. Yeah.

CARTMAN
I would like to see what he looks like
so I can beat him up for you. May I
see the video?

BUTTERS
Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O.
Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.
Can you help me?

CARTMAN
What?

BUTTERS
Remember I said I put that medicinal
suppository in my anus? It'll be so
much easier havin' you do it from now
on.

CARTMAN
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed
for that function.

BUTTERS
Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you.
You just take this little thingy out
of the plastic... paper, and and I'll,
I'll pull down my pants ...and just
slide it up in my anus there.

CARTMAN
...No way.

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed
to do whatever I tell you.

CARTMAN
Weak!

BUTTERS
Yeyeah, that, that's pretty good. Get
it up there good and deep.

CARTMAN
Lame!

[Butters' house, moments later. The bedroom light remains on]


BUTTERS
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get
some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach
you some bedtime songs? If you leave
me now, you'll take away the biggest
part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...

CARTMAN
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.


BUTTERS
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get
us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever
robots have.

[Morning. A cock crows. Butters wakes up, but AWESOM-O isn't
in bed with him. He looks around and sees his room is a mess.
His drawers are out of the dressers and his clothes are strewn
all over the place. One of his clothing rods has been knocked
down and his closet doors are open. AWESOM-O is shown at Butters'
desk looking through more stuff.]

CARTMAN
Where is it? Where is it??

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O??

CARTMAN
Wah!

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you
doing?

CARTMAN
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your
stuff for you.

BUTTERS
Aw Jeez Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna
be awful sore when she sees this mess!
Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You
can't do no chores for me unless I tell
you to do them! You got it?!

CARTMAN
AWESOM-O understands.

BUTTERS
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin',
AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!
Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it
because I love you. Okay, come on, let's
go make some breakfast.

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!


[Butters' house, downstairs. Butters is drawing a picture at
the coffee table]

BUTTERS
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture
of us playing in a field together.
Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get
some Sunny Delight.

CARTMAN
I would like some Sunny Delight too.


BUTTERS
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't
need to drink nothin'.  Uheehee.  Whoa.
Uh go answer the door, AWESOM-O.

CARTMAN
AWESOM-O will answers the door.

KYLE
What the hell are you doing, fatass?


STAN
Dude, are you still pretending to be
a robot?

CARTMAN
Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters
think I'm a robot for a little while
longer.

STAN
Why?

CARTMAN
Because I need to, all right?! I've
got something planned that's uh gonna
be really sweet. Just play along, okay?


STAN
Why?

CARTMAN
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?


BUTTERS
Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?

CARTMAN
Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.


BUTTERS
Ah, hey fellas! Ah I see you met my
robot.

STAN
Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.

BUTTERS
Hey he sure is! We do everything together.
Why last night we even had a slumber
party.

CARTMAN
Weak.

BUTTERS
He can do anything I command him to.
He's real smart. Watch this: hey AWESOM-O,
will you go get my friends some Sunny
Delight?

CARTMAN
Yes, of course.

KYLE
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like
some celery sticks chopped up two inches
long, with peanut butter and raisins
on top.

CARTMAN
Suck mah balls, Kyle.

BUTTERS
He's made in Japan!

[The dining room. Chris holds a cup of coffee and listens as
Linda talks to Liane]

LINDA
Yes, it has just been a delight having
your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and
Butters are really getting along great.


LIANE
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch.
Eric has been having some emotional
problems lately.

LINDA
Well, the reason I'm calling is that
Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt
Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend.
The boys are getting along so well that
we were thinking of inviting Eric to
go along.

LIANE
Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric
is still supposed to be grounded for
trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks
ago.

LINDA
Excuse me, I didn't catch that.

LIANE
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for
him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll
bring some of clothes over.

LINDA
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.


[The kitchen. AWESOM-O rummages around under the sink]

CARTMAN
Maybe he put that videotape in here
somewhere.

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends
are waiting for their beverages. Chop
chop!

LINDA
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged:
you two are both going to Los Angeles
to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!

BUTTERS
Oh boy! My robot gets to come with
me to see Aunt Nellie?!

CARTMAN
What?

BUTTERS
Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have
the best time ever!

CARTMAN
Lame.

[Los Angeles, day. The Hollywood sign appears in the background]


[Aunt Nellie's house]

UNCLE
Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin'
around the airport.

BUTTERS
Howdy Aunt Nellie!

AUNT NELLIE
There's my little nephew! How was your
flight?

BUTTERS
It was long. We had a three-hour delay
...departin' Denver, but we're here!


AUNT NELLIE
Didn't ya bring any bags?

BUTTERS
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin'
them in.

AUNT NELLIE
Your robot?

UNCLE
Butters' new friend is a little strange.
He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.


BUTTERS
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt
Nellie.

AUNT NELLIE
Hello! It's nice to have you here.


CARTMAN
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where
is the nearest toilet, please?

AUNT NELLIE
Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.


CARTMAN
Thank you.

UNCLE
I don't think he took the costume off
the entire trip.

AUNT NELLIE
Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing,
or are you guys hungry after such a
long flight.

BUTTERS
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O
is a robot, so he don't need to eat.


AUNT NELLIE
Right...

[Aunt Nellie's restroom. Cartman runs in frantically and takes
off the helmet. His hair is matted against his head and he gasps
for air. He runs up to the sink and reaches ...for the toothpaste.
He squeezes the tube and sucks out the contents hungrily]

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O?

CARTMAN
Aw-Aw-AWESOM-O is coming.

BUTTERS
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a-sightseein'!


CARTMAN
Argh!

[Montage. Hollywood Boulevard, facing the Chinese Theater. The
Passion is playing there. Butters takes a picture of AWESOM-O
next to the cemented hand- and footprints of the stars. Next,
he and AWESOM-O ride down a log in an amusement park. Next, he
and AWESOM-O are in a plane ride together. Next, AWESOM-O rubs
some suntan lotion on Butters' back. Next, he and AWESOM-O take
part in a Galaxy Studios Tour ride. A shark pops up and roars
menacingly at the riders. Next, Catamount Pictures is shown.]


BUTTERS
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot
friend

We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun

We're two of a kind- That's me!

And my robot friend.

My robot friend.

My robot ...friend.

[Catamount Pictures. Butters and Cartman walk around. Cartman
carries the bags]

BUTTERS
Can you believe we're at a real live
movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin'
the best time?

CARTMAN
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some
time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet
up later, perhaps?

BUTTERS
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The
film studio commissary.  That's where
all them rich movie producers who come
up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have
their lunch. Neato, huh?

[Le Catamount Bistró, Two producers talk.]

PRODUCER
Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio
can't come up with any winners? I mean,
we're smart, right?

MITCH
We're really smart.

PRODUCER
We need an idea for a movie that's a
home run. A feel-good romp for the whole
family.  Hey, what's that over there?


WOMAN
Wow, that's a really neat little robot
you have there, little boy.

GIRL
What's he do?

BUTTERS
Well, he can do anything. Watch this:
Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Superbowl
next year?

CARTMAN
The New Orleans Saints.

BOY
Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would
a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood?

CARTMAN
Seventeen.

PRODUCER
Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?


MITCH
Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed
to come up with movie ideas!

PRODUCER
Exactly!

[Catamount Pictures boardroom. The producer introduces Butters
and AWESOM-O to his staff]

PRODUCER
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind
enough to let us show you his robot.
The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen
what he can do.

STAFFER 1
Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not
a robot.

PRODUCER
It's not?

STAFFER 1
No, it clearly had bipedal movement,
so the correct term is "computerized
automatron."

MITCH
Oh, very nice, Mitch.

STAFFER 2
You are the smart one.

PRODUCER
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this
automatron can help us come up with
new movie ideas.

STAFFER 2
How can a robot come up with better
ideas for movies than us?

PRODUCER
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current
trends of the movie-going public can
you come up with an idea for a movie
that will break a hundred million box
office?

CARTMAN
Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler
is like, in love with some girl, but
then it turns out that the girl is actually
a ...golden retriever, or something.


STAFFER 2
Oh, perfect!

STAFFER 3
We'll call it "Puppy Love"!

STAFFER 2
Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!


MITCH
Yeah yeah!

STAFFER 3
Let's hear it!

MITCH
Yeah, we wanna hear it!

STAFFER 3
Come on, come on!

CARTMAN
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler...
inherits like, a billion dollars, but
first, he has to, like, become a ...boxer,
or something.

STAFFER 3
...Yes, it's flawless!

MITCH
Punch-Drunk Billionaire!

[Aunt Nellie's place, guest room. Butters is at the desk counting
up all the movie he and AWESOM-O got for Cartman's ideas and
putting one hundred dollar bills one per envelope.]

BUTTERS
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O?
Can you believe those guys paid us a
hundred dollars apiece for those movie
ideas?

CARTMAN
You should split that money with AWESOM-O.
After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.


BUTTERS
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do
with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot
pants? Haha, no! We got each other and
that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna
send this money to needy kids in third-world
countries.

CARTMAN
Haaaa! Haaaa!

BUTTERS
Ye, you okay AWESOM-O?

CARTMAN
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.


BUTTERS
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O.
We've got another full day of pitching
movies tomorrow.

[Washington DC, the Pentagon.]

[The Pentagon, a boardroom. A general addresses his peers]

GENERAL
Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that
we live in a time of uncertainty. The
risk of an attack on American soil is
higher than ever. Now, I believe we
may be able to curb that risk. Two days
ago our intelligence department came
across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It
is currently being used by Catamount
Pictures to develop ideas for movies.
Our sources say that in just one week
it has come up with over one thousand
movie ideas, eight hundred of which
feature Adam Sandler.

BLACK OFFICIAL
That's incredible!

WHITE OFFICIAL
You're thinking the robot could be used
to come up with anti-Islamic movies?


GENERAL
No. If we got our hands on that robot,
we could reprogram it and turn it into
a weapon!.

BLACK OFFICIAL
Yes, that might be the best thing to
do.

WHITE OFFICIAL
Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.


SCIENTIST
Hold on a second: If that robot is designed
for entertainment, then, turning it
into a weapon is unethical.

GENERAL
Unethical? Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand
that the robot is from Japan! That means
that the Japanese have more of them!
And if the Japanese fabricates one of
them into a weapon before we do...


BLACK OFFICIAL
Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all
over again.

WHITE OFFICIAL
But worse. With robots.

SCIENTIST
I I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we
have no data suggesting the Japanese
have developed a robot with offensive
capability.

GENERAL
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist!
National security is our jub.  Gentlemen,
we're going to Los Angeles!  I want
that robot!

[Catamount Pictures lobby. Butters places a call.]

BUTTERS
Yeah, me and my robot are still over
at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're
makin' all sorts of money for the poor.


[The boardroom. Cartman is pitching more movie ideas.]

CARTMAN
Movie idea number two thousand three
hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped
on an island and falls in love with
a coconut.

PRODUCER
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take
a break. I need a minute alone with
AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot,
AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are
you by chance a ...pleasure model?


CARTMAN
...What?

PRODUCER
Well, have you been programmed to...
satisfy... urges of humans?

CARTMAN
AWESOM-O does not understand.

PRODUCER
Let me show you what I mean.

[Catamount Pictures lobby]

BUTTERS
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time,
Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys
are real nice.

CARTMAN
LAME!

BUTTERS
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money.
I can't believe it either.

CARTMAN
NOT COOL! TOTALLY LAME!

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie.
Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of
malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd
ya go?

CARTMAN
Waaaaa!

SOLDIER
Let's go! Move, move!

BUTTERS
AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin'
with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!


[A military base near Los Angeles. In a warehouse, AWESOM-O,
shackled onto a platform, is raised from a horizontal position
to vertical. Two soldiers approach on either side of Cartman
and tighten the locks on him]

GENERAL
Are those arm and leg locks secure?


SOLDIER
Secure, sir!

GENERAL
Good. I don't want that robot mobile
until I know what it's capable of. All
right, power it on.

CARTMAN
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

SCIENTIST
What the hell?

GENERAL
What's going on?

SCIENTIST
It... powered itself back on.

GENERAL
Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.


CARTMAN
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't
I move?!

SCIENTIST
Are your systems stable? Run a systems
check on your CPU.

CARTMAN
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!


SCIENTIST
Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me
to reprogram you.

CARTMAN
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!


SCIENTIST
What did you say?

CARTMAN
I said I'm a real person, asswipe!


SCIENTIST
...Oh my God.

GENERAL
What's happening?

SCIENTIST
The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's
developed consciousness.

GENERAL
What? How can that be?

SCIENTIST
Must be a malfunction of its exographical
IMS or the... interlaced BV system.


GENERAL
Speak in a language we can understand,
Mr. Scientist!

SCIENTIST
Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!


CARTMAN
Goddamnit, get me down from here!


GENERAL
Who made you, robot?!

CARTMAN
I'm not a robot, I'm a human!

WHITE OFFICIAL
Jesus, the scientist was right.

GENERAL
But, who would have programmed it to
think it was human? The movie studio?


CARTMAN
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman!
I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!


GENERAL
Dear Christ, they gave it memories,
too.

SCIENTIST
Sure, why not? Program the memories
of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't
exist, and make the robot think he's
real! Makes for a lot better movies!
I'm not reprogramming a robot that's
developed consciousness!

GENERAL
Do I have to remind you of your position?!
Don't forget you have a duty to your
country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that
robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED,
so we can take it back to Washington!
GOT IT?!

SCIENTIST
Damn you all to hell!..

[Los Angeles. Butters walks down a sidwalk alone with his head
down]

BUTTERS
Hey there, did you know I had a robot
friend?

We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.

He was my ten gigahertz old pal.

My robot friend.

BUTTERS
Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the
van that-  Oh my God!

[The military base, warehouse. The scientist has positioned AWESOM-O
so his head can be drilled into, and a huge drill bit begins
to descend towards him.]

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!


SOLDIER
It'll all be over soon, robot!

SCIENTIST
Hang on! I'm getting you out of here,
robot!

CARTMAN
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!


GENERAL
What the hell are you doing?!

SCIENTIST
Well I, I'm saving a conscious being!
If you wanna kill it, you'll have to
go through me!

GENERAL
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!

CARTMAN
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show
you stupid assholes who I really am!


BUTTERS
AWESOM-O!

CARTMAN
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.

BUTTERS
No!!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's
my best friend! He's my best friend
in the whole world!

SCIENTSIT
There. You see? You want to tell me
this isn't humanity? Who's to judge
what makes somethng human anyway?!
Does this make me human?!  Or this?!
Or these?!

GENERAL
Perhaps... there is consciousness in
this robot. Maybe we as a society need
to realize that artificial intelligence...
is intelligence all the same, and we
can learn from the robots. I think maybe
one day we can all-  Heh- wait a minute,
did, did that robot just fart?

BUTTERS
Hey, robots don't fart!

CARTMAN
Uh... now ending fart sequence.

GENERAL
Oh, and it, it smells, too!

CARTMAN
Smell sequence initiated.

BLACK OFFICIAL
A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't
make any sense.

BUTTERS
Hang on a second here!

[A room somewhere. A portable screen is put up and the videotape
of Cartman acting strange in his backyard is being shown. The
sound of laughing kids is heard. On the tape, Cartman is dancing
around like Britney Spears]

CARTMAN


Would you like to touch my body?

Come on and touch my body!

Oooo, my hot body!

Don't you like my hot body?

Come on and touch my titties!

I felt them just like ???

Come on Justin, touch my body! [begins dancing with a life-size
cutout of Justin Timberlake]

Mmm, Justin, yeah!

Touch my body! You and me!

Check it out, my not-hot body!

Come on, my body!

GENERAL
Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!


CARTMAN
Lame...

Matt Stone & Trey Parker



EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing.

INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

The children take their seats for another day of school.

Cartman is passing out envelopes to all the kids.

CARTMAN
Here you go, Kyle. And here's yours
Stan...

KYLE
(Opening the envelope)
What is this, Cartman?

CARTMAN
They're invitations to my birthday
party this weekend.

STAN
Oh, Sweet! Your mom is giving you a
big party again this year?

CARTMAN
Thaaaat's right!
(Singing)
'Cause it's my birthday! My Bu-Bu
Birthdayyy!

KYLE
Kick ass, dude. Cartman's mom throws
the best birthday parties ever!

CARTMAN
That's right!

STAN
Yeah, if MY mom could cook like
Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat ass
too.

CARTMAN
That's right!
(Catching himself)
HEY!

PIP
Oh Eric, I didn't get an invitation.

CARTMAN
Oh really? Gosh, where could I have
put Pip's invitation?

Cartman pretends to look around.

CARTMAN
Let's see... Pip's invitation...
Pip's invitation... OH, I REMEMBER!

Pip lights up.

CARTMAN
I shoved it up my ass!

Pip looks sad.

CARTMAN
Yes that's right, I wrote it out,
put it in a envelope, sealed it, and
then PLOOP! Shoved it right my ass,
forever ruining any chance you had
of coming to my birthday party. Sorry,
Pip ol' chap.

Cartman walks past Pip and hands out more invites.

CARTMAN
Here's yours Wendy, and here's yours
Clyde...

Mr. Garrison walks in.

MR. GARRISON
Children, children... Today is a
very special day --

CARTMAN
No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.

MR. GARRISON
I'm not talking about your birthday,
Eric. We have a new student joining
our class today!

The kids all moan.

MR. GARRISON
Now, some of you know what it's like
to be the new kid in town. So I want
you all to take special care to make
him feel welcome.

An odd-looking child wearing all black steps up next to Mr.
Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
I want you all to meet our new
classmate... Uh... What's your name
again?

DAMIEN
Damien.

CLOSE UP on Damien's eyes. Demonic music plays.

MR. GARRISON
Say hi to Damien!

The kids don't respond.

MR. GARRISON
And where are you from, Damien?

DAMIEN
The seventh layer of hell.

MR. GARRISON
Ooh, that's exciting. My mother was
from Alabama.

Damien stands up on a chair.

DAMIEN
My arrival connotes the end of the
beginning the beginning of the end!
The new reign of my father!

MR. GARRISON
Your father?

DAMIEN
The Prince of Darkness!

Dramatic music.

MR. GARRISON
Wow, we have royalty in our class!
Why don't you take your seat, Damien,
we're going to finish our lesson on
great singers of the Baroque Era.

Damien gets down from the chair and sits next to Cartman.

Cartman glares at him.

MR. GARRISON
Now children, Nancy Sinatra was quite
a choice piece of ass...

As Garrison continues, Cartman leans over to Damien.

CARTMAN
Hey new kid, do you want an invitation
to my birthday party?

DAMIEN
Here begins the rule of pain. The
new domination of --

CARTMAN
PSYCHE!! I wasn't gonna GIVE you an
invitation!! HA, HA!!

Damien looks shocked.

CARTMAN
Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?

Damien turns his head to one side. CHOIR MUSIC kicks in as
Cartman's desk goes flying up into the air and out the window.

STAN
Woa, dude!

KYLE
Damn! What a FREAK!

CARTMAN
HEY! I had a poofie pie in that desk.

DAMIEN
NOW FEEL THE WRATH OF THE FALLEN
ANGEL!! THE PLAGUE OF NIGHT IS UPON
THE!!!

MR. GARRISON
Damien, do you need to sit in time
out for a few minutes?

Damien looks around, confused. Then he steps down from his
desk and sits calmly.

CARTMAN
(Singing)
You got in trou-ble! You got in trou-
ble!

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The boys are eating lunch. Stan is reading from an envelope.

STAN
Hey Cartman, how come the birthday
invitation you gave me says 'Green
Mega Man'?

KYLE
Yeah, mine says 'Red Mega-Man'.

CARTMAN
Right. That's what you're supposed
to get me for my birthday.

Stan and Kyle look at each other.

STAN
Dude! You're not supposed to TELL
people what to get you for your
birthday!

KYLE
Yeah, that's weak!

CARTMAN
Look, it's very simple, guys. Green
Mega Man goes with Red Mega-Man and
Yellow Mega-Man to make the Ultra-
Mega-Mega-Man. You have to have all
three or doesn't work, see?

STAN
Up yours, Cartman. I'll get you
whatever the hell I want!

CARTMAN
Oh! So maybe you don't want to have
any of my mom's cake pie and ice
cream then!

Stan shuts up.

STAN
Oh, Green Mega-Man it is.

CARTMAN
Now, as you can see, Kenny, YOU are
to get me Yellow Mega-Man. That's
because yellow Mega-Man is the
cheapest one, and I know how poor
your family is...

Just then, Damien sits down with his lunch tray. The boys
all looked shocked.

STAN
Hey, what do you think you're doing,
new kid?

CARTMAN
Yeah, you can't sit with us, weirdo!

Damien looks a little hurt.

DAMIEN
INFIDELS! I will turn you all into
beasts of burden!!

KYLE
You can't sit with us new kid! Go
find another table!!

Damien scowls and stomps off.

CARTMAN
Anyway, Kenny, yellow Mega-Man is
only $8.95, so maybe your mom can
put it on layaway and make payments
for a year or two.

Stan and Kyle laugh. Kenny punches Cartman.

As Cartman continues, Damien sits at a table that is empty
except for Pip.

PIP
Oh, good day, Damien! My name is
Phillip, but everyone calls me
'Pip'... Because they hate me.

DAMIEN
Then I will call you PIP.

PIP
Right-o.

Stan calls over from his table --

STAN
Hey new kid!

Damien turns to the boys.

STAN
Kenny says he saw your mom drop you
off this morning, and she's a REAL
DOG!

The boys all laugh. Damien scowls.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

The boys laugh even harder. Damien gets pissed. He cringes
his brow. More CHOIR music jumps in.

DAMIEN
THAT DOES IT!! OOF-FAAA!!!

Kenny shivers and shakes and then suddenly -- PWOOF! Kenny
is turned into a duck billed platypus. (Still wearing his
little orange coat.)

STAN
What the --

KYLE
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck
billed platypus!

STAN
A what?

KENNY
Wack, wack.

CARTMAN
HEY!! Turn him back you butthole!!
He has to buy me the yellow Mega-
Man!!

CHEF
Hello there, children!

BOYS
Hey, Chef.

CHEF
How's it going?

STAN AND KYLE
Bad.

CHEF
Why bad?

KYLE
Chef, there's a new kid in school,
and he's a total weird-o freak.

CHEF
Oh children, children, you shouldn't
not like somebody just because they're
different. Here, let me sing you a
little song...

Music starts in.

CHEF
(Singing)
We're all special, in our own way
Everybody's different but that's
okay 'Cause even though we might
have different color skin, different
points of views, be tall or thin --
It doesn't mean I can't lay you down,
woman and touch your silky skin --
Put my love deep inside you where no
man has ever been -- Rub your legs,
caress your thighs and....

Chef stops himself.

CHEF
What were we talking about again?

KYLE
(Pointing)
The new kid.

Damien is now standing on the lunch table with his arms
raised.

DAMIEN
Death to the holy! The wrath of the
fallen angel now makes for you all!!!!

Damien throws his hands in the air and tables go flying
everywhere. Blood starts dripping from the ceiling.

STAN
WHOA!!!!

The cafeteria is like the eye of a hurricane.

CHEF
Ooh, that is one futched up little
cracker!!!!

KYLE
We told you, dude!

Damien continues to throw his hands up in the air. Shit
continues to fly everywhere.

CHEF
(Shouting)
We've got to do something, children!
He's tearing my cafeteria apart!!

DAMIEN
BRING ME JESUS!! MY WRATH SHALL
CONTINUE UNTIL I SPEAK WITH JESUS!!!

Stan and Kyle look at each other.

KYLE & STAN
Jesus?

INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

Jesus is sitting at a make-up table brushing his hair.

STAGE MANAGER
Two minutes to air, Jesus.

JESUS
Thanks, Roland. Blessed art Thou.

Stan and Kyle charge into the dressing room.

STAN
Jesus, Jesus!!

JESUS
Hi kids, I only do autographs after
the show.

STAN
No, no, there's a big problem at
school! Some new kid showed up wearing
all black and Chef thinks he's evil.

KYLE
Yeah, look what he did to our friend
Kenny.

KENNY
Wack, wack.

JESUS
Wow... That's pretty heavy.

STAN
This new kid keeps throwing things
around and saying stuff about his
Dark Prince Father coming. He said
he wants to talk to you.

JESUS
(Standing)
The Dark Prince?

STAN AND KYLE
Yeah.

ZOOM IN on Jesus who suddenly realizes what this all means.

JESUS
(Standing up)
So it was written... And so the cycle
of years brings the son of the evil
one...

STAN
(To Kyle)
Oh brother, now HE'S talking like
the new kid.

JESUS
Thou must taketh me to the seedling
of Satan so mine eyes can confirm
the wretched truth.

KYLE
Kay.

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - PLAYGROUND - DAY

A recess monitor blows her whistle as kids run around the
playground.

RECESS MONITOR
Five minutes until recess is over
you little bastards!!

Cartman is standing by the swingset with full on graphs,
charts and drawings. A few random kids are gathered around.

Cartman has a pointer in his hand and is using it to
demonstrate as he talks.

CARTMAN
Now, as you can see, the Red Mega-
Man uses the --
(Pointing)
Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will
be getting me for my birthday. Wendy,
YOU were supposed to get me the Mega
Power Chopper illustrated --
(Pointing)
HERE. But I am changing your present
to the Yellow Mega-Man, since Kenny
has been turned into a --
(Pointing)
duck billed platypus. That means
that the Mega-Man Beach House,
illustrated here... Will be a gift
given by two people at once...

The kids all try to follow along with their eyes. A few take
notes.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PLAYGROUND

Meanwhile, Damien is at another part of the playground setting
things on fire with his hands. Pip is standing next to him.

Damien spins around and burns down the slide. Several children
look sad.

BEBE
Our slide!

Damien spins around and sets the teeter-totter a blaze. Again
the children look sad.

DAMIEN
FEEL MY WRATH!!!

PIP
Oh dear, you shouldn't be so upset,
Damien. I know its hard being the
new kid, but the children may accept
you some day.

DAMIEN
(Insincere)
I DON'T NEED ACCEPTANCE! I'M THE SON
OF SATAN!!

Another flick of the hand, and Damien burns down the little
spring-animals.

Damien turns and burns down the jungle gym.

PIP
Believe me, I know what its like not
to have friends. Perhaps you should
speak to the school counselor, he
helps me a lot when I'm feeling
lonely.

Damien stops and thinks.

JESUS
DAMIEN!!!

Damien turns around and sees Jesus standing with Stan and
Kyle and the Kenny duck billed platypus.

DAMIEN
AH! Son of Stench!! Cursed ruler of
the weak!!

JESUS
So it IS Thou! Son of Lucifer!!

DAMIEN
Your time on this Earth is short!!
Soon my father comes!!!

Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman follow the biblical exchange
like a tennis match with their heads.

JESUS
Let him come then! I shall stop him!

DAMIEN
Behold! He is already upon us!!

Suddenly, clouds move all over the sky. The day becomes black.

KYLE
Oh, dude!

A huge booming voice comes from all around.

EVIL VOICE
Et dominous em pluribus unom som...

Damien closes his eyes and listens. Jesus looks around,
confused.

EVIL VOICE
Forente omi sanctum san ri en unibus.

Winds blow, thing fly all around. Half the townspeople come
running up to see what's happening.

JIMBO
What the hell is going on?!

Now a normal looking priest, (we call him PRIEST MAXI) walks
up and looks around.

PRIEST MAXI
(Pointing to Jesus)
Look! It's that guy from the public
access show!

Jesus looks around the flying debris. Chef comes running up
as well.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

CHEF
(To the pretty women)
Come over here if you're scared,
womens! I'll protect you!

Mr. Garrison hides in Chef's bosom.

CHEF
Not, you dammit!

EVIL VOICE
En ri... En ri omnibus spiritus...

Finally, Damien opens his eyes.

DAMIEN
Jesus... My father says... He CHOOSES
YOU! He CALLS YOU OUT!

Jesus eyes grow wide. All the townspeople look at each other.

DAMIEN
Be here at this time tomorrow! There
the terms will be discussed!

JESUS
Very well! Let the final battle
between good and evil be fought...
Right here in South Park!

The townspeople all look thrilled.

JIMBO
Come on Ned! We gotta get our asses
to the bookie!!

Everyone disperses. Stan and Kyle walks up next to Jesus.

STAN
You're gonna fight Satan?

JESUS
This fight has been ordained since
the beginning. My children, this is
the most crucial and serious time of
all history...

INT. TELEVISION

An ad is playing on the television.

CARTMAN
Hey, wait a minute! Saturday is my

KENNY
Mwack, mwack!

STAN
I don't know what to do, dude. Do we
go to the fight or Cartman's birthday?

CARTMAN
Cartman's birthday!

KYLE
We can't miss the final apocalyptic
battle between good and evil.

CARTMAN
You guys! My mom's getting a ferris
wheel!

STAN
Well, come on, we have to at least
see the weigh in.

Stan, Kyle and Kenny head out.

CARTMAN
WHO THE HELL DECIDED THIS FIGHT HAD
TO BE ON SATURDAY HUH?!! THIS WHOLE
THING IS A PLOT AGAINST ME, ISN'T
IT!!

COMMERCIAL BREAK 1

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

A large group of people have gathered around Jesus in downtown
South Park.

PRIEST MAXI
When is Satan going to show up?

Another Townsperson shrugs as he prepares his camera by
cleaning off the lens.

The boys walk up.

STAN
Did The Devil show up yet?

JESUS
Not yet.

KYLE
Hey Jesus, If you win the fight can
you turn Kenny back to normal?

Jesus looks at the little duck billed platypus.

JESUS
What the hell do you mean IF I win
the fight?

CARTMAN
(Aside)
Don't mind him, Jesus. He's Jewish.

JESUS
(Understanding)
Oh.

Still more townspeople show up.

JIMBO
We're all with you Jesus! We put
every dime we have on you beating
that Dark Prince!

The townspeople all cheer.

JESUS
Thank you for your faith. But I think
perhaps you don't understand the
severity of the situation...

PRIEST MAXI
You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus!

The Townspeople all cheer again. Suddenly, a HUGE booming
sound starts.

JESUS
Behold, the evil one approaches.

In walks Satan. Seven feet two inches, three hundred and ten
pounds -- A BIG, BAD ASS MOTHER FUCKER.

Jesus' eyes get HUGE.

The Townspeople's jaws all drop in unison.

MR. GARRISON
Holy poop on a stick!

SATAN
(Deep, bellowing voice)
Puny son of Jehovah. Prepare to enter
thy house of pain.

STAN
Holy crap, dude, Satan is HUGE!

JIMBO
Now that is a man who has eaten a
lot of beef.

Jesus tries to look tough, but he's obviously scared. Stan
and Kyle look at each other with deep concern.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

Everybody is still gathered around for the weigh in. Satan
stands in front of Jesus looking tough and confident.

SATAN
Son of God, I will smash thy face
into small little bits.

Jesus swallows hard, then tries desperately not to sound
scared.

JESUS
Oh... Oh yeah?

SATAN
I have such delightful horrors to
unleash upon thee.

JESUS
Oh yeah?

The Townspeople look at each other, concerned. The Weigh In
Guy stands with a large scale. He gestures for Satan to step
up, and he does.

WEIGH IN GUY
Satan weighs in at... Three Hundred
and Twenty pounds four ounces!

The townspeople all gasp. Jesus replaces Satan on the scale.

WEIGH IN GUY
Jesus Christ weighs in at... A hundred
and thirty-five pounds -- one ounce!

Stan and Kyle look at each other.

CHEF
Ooh, crap.

JESUS
(Checking the scale)
Oh come on, I weigh more than that!

Satan throws his arms in the air.

SATAN
LET THE NEW PRINCE BE DECIDED ON
SATURDAY!! FIRST SOUTH PARK, THEN
THE WORLD!!!!!!!!

Satan leaves. Jesus stands there, still obviously shaken.

The Townspeople look around, with knowing nods.

JIMBO
Well... I think I'll uh... I think I
left the oven on...

MR. GARRISON
Yeah... I think I left your oven on,
too...

All the Townspeople slowly back away. Jesus looks at them
suspiciously.

PRIEST MAXI
See ya, Saturday, Jesus. Good Luck...

INT. SPORT'S BOOK - DAY

The townspeople suddenly burst through the doors and storm
the bookie.

JIMBO
I want to change my bet to Satan!!

NED
Me too!!

MR. GARRISON
I was here first!

INT. SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

A wiry, dorky man sits at a desk with his hands folded. A
sign on the desk tells us very clearly that this is the SCHOOL
COUNSELOR.

COUNSELOR
Now, as your counselor, I want you
to feel like you can tell me ANYTHING
OK?... Being the new kid can be tough,
but I'm your friend Okay.

Sitting across from the counselor is little Damien, actually
looking a little bummed for the first time.

DAMIEN
Everybody hates me.

COUNSELOR
Well... Why do you suppose that is?

DAMIEN
(Thinking)
Because I'm the son of the devil?

COUNSELOR
Uh-huh. That's a good start. Why
else?

DAMIEN
(Thinking)
Because I burn them and kill them?

COUNSELOR
Well, yes, maybe that's it... What
you need to do Damien is to be overly
nice. No matter how mean the other
kids are to you, just don't retaliate.

Damien thinks.

COUNSELOR
Be passive, Okay? that's what I taught
the little British boy, Pip, and
just look at how much the other
children like him now!

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - PLAYGROUND - DAY

A few children are standing in a circle with Pip in the
middle.

CLYDE
I bet I can spit the most on him!

Clyde let's a loogie go on Pip.

BEBE
Oh yeah, I bet I can get spit in his
hair!

Bebe spits a wod in Pip's eye.

PIP
Oh, nice try! A little higher and
you've got it.

At another part of the playground, the boys are all just
standing around, since all the playground equipment was burned
down by Damien.

STAN
Man, recess sucks without any slides
or nothin'.

CARTMAN
Oh, here comes unholy butthole now.

Damien walks by.

CARTMAN
Hey! Thanks a lot for burning
everything down, you little bitch!

Damien takes a deep breath.

DAMIEN
I apologize for ruining your
playground and turning your friend
into a duck billed platypus. I was
doing my father's bidding. I didn't
have a choice.

The boys all think.

CARTMAN
Oh, oh!

Cartman walks up to Damien and farts on him.

CARTMAN
Oh, excuse me, new kid! I didn't
mean to fart on you, I didn't have a
choice!

Damien looks pissed, but he holds back.

STAN
Whew! You stink new kid! You smell
like a fart!

KYLE
Yeah, we're gonna call you fart boy
from now on!

Damien walks off, pissed off and sad.

STAN
Bye Bye, Fart boy!

KYLE
See ya!

Damien leaves and walks up to Pip.

PIP
Good day. How are you, Damien?

DAMIEN
Those guys farted on me and then
called me --

PIP
Fart boy? Oh good, perhaps they won't
call ME that any more!

INT. SOUTH PARK BAR - NIGHT

The Townspeople are all sitting around tables, drinking beer
and conversing.

Suddenly, Jesus walks in through the front door looking very
upset.

JESUS
Excuse me!

And the room goes silent.

JESUS
(Pissed)
I just talked to the BOOKIE at the
sports BETTING bar...

CHEF
Oh, oh...

The townspeople all look around and whistle.

JESUS
I HAVE BEEN FORSAKEN!! It seems that
several bets were changed to Satan
this morning!

The townspeople look at each other.

JESUS
In fact, it seems that only ONE PERSON
in this ENTIRE TOWN is still betting
on me!

Jimbo looks at the townspeople with disapproval.

PRIEST MAXI
You should all be ashamed of
yourselves! Betting against your
Lord and savior! I am disgusted!

JESUS
YOUR bet was changed as well. YOU
Forsaked me too!

PRIEST MAXI
Uh, right... Well, he does have a
couple hundred pounds on you, Jesus.

JESUS
I implore you all -- Don't bet on
the Dark one! It is a bet that you
will NEVER win!

PRIEST MAXI
Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned
against you. I am gonna march right
over to that bookie and change my
bet RIGHT NOW!

MR. GARRISON
Oh Yeah, me too!

JIMBO
Yeah!

PRIEST MAXI
Praise the Lord. Thank you sweet
Jesus for showing us the light, See
ya later!

Jesus pauses, then again looks suspicious and walks out. As
soon as the door closes, everybody immediately sits back and
starts drinking again.

PRIEST MAXI
What the hell, does he think we're
crazy?

Everybody laughs. Jesus pops back in.

JESUS
You're all a bunch of Judases!

EXT. SOUTH PARK BAR - NIGHT

Jesus walks out of the bar huffingly and bumps into the boys.

STAN
Hey, Jesus.

JESUS
What are you doing out so late, kids?

KYLE
We have to find red and green mega-
mans for Cartman's birthday party.

JESUS
Oh...
(thinking)
Kids... YOU believe I can beat Satan,
right?

STAN
Sure, dude, you're the son of God.

KYLE
Yeah. You aren't having doubts are
you?

JESUS
No, no...
(Pause)
But could you help me train a little?

INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY

Several cameras are surrounding a table where Satan is sitting
behind a plethora of microphones.

REPORTER
Satan, what do you expect the outcome
of the fight to be?

SATAN
I will crush him like a little bug.

ANOTHER REPORTER
Satan, what about the rumors of your
involvement in the Gulf War?

Satan starts to speak, but suddenly a hand jumps in and covers
up the microphone.

WHIP PAN RIGHT to reveal DON KING sitting next to Satan.

DON KING
Let's focus on the fight, can we
please? I'm so sick of people talking
smack about my fighters. All this
'He's mean', 'He's a dirty fighter',
'He the cause for all violence and
death in the world', it's just getting
old. Let's just let everything be
decided in the ring.

INT. GYM - DAY

Jesus is wearing large boxing gloves, and punching a bag
that Stan and Kyle are holding.

CARTMAN
You guys, shouldn't you be out
shopping for my birthday presents?

KYLE
(Ignoring him)
Here, Jesus, drink these raw eggs.

JESUS
No way, dude.

Jesus steps into the little ring. Chef is standing there
with boxing gloves.

CHEF
I can't... I can't hit Jesus Christ.
My mother would never speak to me
again.

STAN
But you're his sparring partner,
Chef.

KYLE
Yeah, you have to hit him.

JESUS
Satan must be defeated, Chef. Please
help me to train.

CHEF
Okay, but I'm just gonna tap you,
alright?

JESUS
Give it your best sho --

SLAM!!!! Chef punches Jesus in the face, and Jesus flies to
the canvas.

CHEF
Oh, God in Heaven!! What have I
done?!?

JESUS
Oof... Anybody get the number of
that truck?

COMMERCIAL BREAK 2

EXT. CARTMAN'S BACK YARD - DAY

Cartman's birthday party is an AMAZING event. There are
elephants, clowns, mimes, and even a ferris wheel.

A large Banner reads 'Happy Birthday, Eric!'

Cartman's mother walks through the huge crowd of kids,
carrying an ENORMOUS amount of food.

CARTMAN'S MOM
Come on, kiddies! Eat more!

Cartman is walking tall, wearing a little pointed birthday
hat. He greets children as they walk in.

CARTMAN
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your
present on the table to your left...
Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your
left... Welcome Chef...

Chef walks in.

CHEF
Yup, here's your present, children.
Well, nice party, see you later.

Chef starts to walk out.

KYLE
Hey, you just got here, Chef!

CHEF
I know, but the fight is starting!

STAN
But dude, check it out, Cartman's
mom made chili.

Mrs. Cartman gives Chef a wink.

CHEF
Mmmm, that's my favorite kind of
chili.

EXT. OUTSIDE CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Damien and Pip are sitting alone on the curb.

DAMIEN
I guess all the kids are at that fat
boy's birthday party.

PIP
Yes... It's always such a huge event.
Sometimes I like to sneak up to the
fence and close my eyes, and pretend
I'm there.

DAMIEN
The other kids have ALWAYS hated
you?

PIP
Oh, yes. Actually, I think they make
fun of the fat boy a lot too, but
now I think they like him because he
picks on me.

Damien suddenly gets an idea.

EXT. SOUTH PARK FORUM - DAY

A good sized place for a boxing match.

INT. SOUTH PARK FORUM

The arena is huge. Just like the ring at Ceasar's or MGM.

Banners and decorative posters are everywhere.

The place is absolutely packed.

ANNOUNCER
In the blue corner, wearing white
trunks, weighing in at a mere one
hundred and forty pounds -- Jesus El
Saviorrrrrrrrrrr CHRIST!!!!

Everybody cheers.

ANNOUNCER
And in the very very black corner,
wearing very very black trunks, the
King of all that is evil, BEEEEEEE
EL ZEBUB!!!!

The crowd cheers. Jesus shoots them all a dirty look. They
stop.

ANNOUNCER
Ladies & Gentlemen. LLLLLLLLLLLet's
get ready to RUMMMMMBLLLLLE!!!!!

Jesus and Satan meet in the center of the ring. The little
bald ref steps between them.

REF
Okay, I want a good, clean fight
guys, no punches below the belt,
holding or miracles.

The bell rings. Jesus and Satan go to their corners.

EXT. CARTMAN'S BACK YARD - DAY

The big birthday party continues. Boys and girls run around
and play and laugh.

Suddenly, Damien and Pip walk in.

CARTMAN
HEY! What the hell do you think you're
doing here?!

STAN
Yeah, YOU aren't invited, new kid!

KYLE
And neither are YOU, PIP!

PIP
Yes, I tried to tell Damien that we
weren't invited, but --

DAMIEN
Wait a minute, give me a chance! I
want to do something special for
your party...

Just then, Damien touches Pip -- and something incredible
happens. Demons come up from the ground and grab onto Pip.

PIP
Oh NOOOO!!!!!!

The demons hoist Pip up into the air. Pip's clothes catch on
fire. He screams horrifically.

KYLE
Wow!

Pip's body flies up into the sky and PWOOF!!! An explosion
like beautiful fireworks illuminate the party.

The kids all cheer and applaud.

STAN
Wow, that was COOL!!!

KYLE
Hey... You're not such a bad guy
after all, Damien!

CARTMAN
Yeah, come on in and join the party!

Damien absolutely beams with happiness.

INT. SOUTH PARK FORUM - DAY

The bell rings! Jesus and Satan come from their corners.

Satan immediately throws a punch that connects and knocks
Jesus back.

The crowd all goes wild! Jesus turns and looks at them in
disgust. The crowd just as immediately gets quiet.

Jesus takes another couple of blows to the body. The punches
are hard and painful. Jesus looks incredibly sad and scared.

Now Jesus drops his arms and just let's Satan pound on him.

SATAN
Come on you little wuss! FIGHT!!

Satan dances around.

SATAN
Throw a punch!

EXT. CARTMAN'S BACK YARD - DAY

Cartman is wearing a little birthday hat on his head and
standing at a table opening gifts.

CARTMAN
Oh, I wonder what Stan got me for my
birthday... Oh look! A blue Mega-
Man!

Cartman pulls out the toy and smiles.

CARTMAN
Thank you, Stan, you may eat pie and
cake and ice cream, now.

Stan dashes off.

CARTMAN
And what did Wendy get me?
(Before he even opens
it)
Oh, it's The Yellow Mega-Man!

Now Cartman opens the present and sure enough, The Yellow
Mega Man is inside.

CARTMAN
Help yourself to pie, cake and ice
cream, Wendy.

Wendy dashes off.

CARTMAN
Oh! Look what Kyle got me! it's a
Red Mega --
(Opening the gift)
Ants in the Pants?!

Cartman pulls out the game.

CARTMAN
ANTS IN THE PANTS?! ANTS IN THE
PANTS?!

KYLE
It's a game, dude. It's really fun.

CARTMAN
YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!!

Cartman tackles Kyle and knocks him to the ground.

KYLE
AAGHGH!!

CARTMAN
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED
MEGA MAN!!! NOW I CAN'T MAKE ULTRA
MEGA-MEGA MAN!! YOU DIRTY CHEAP ASS
PIECE OF CRAP!!!

Cartman slugs Kyle repeatedly.

KYLE
THEY WERE ALL OUT OF 'EM, DUDE!!!

CARTMAN
I HATE YOU!!! I WANT YOU TO DIE!!!!
DIE!!!!!!!!!

Cartman suddenly gets up and yells to everybody.

CARTMAN
THAT'S IT!! PARTY IS OVER!!! EVERYBODY
GO HOME!!!

The kids all look stunned. Cartman walks over to a HUGE switch
and pulls it down. Immediately the entire party shuts down --
The ferris wheel stops, the lights go off and all the music
stops.

CARTMAN
GET THE HELL OUT I SAID!! PARTY'S
OVER!!! GET OUT GODAMNIT!!

The kids all start to file out.

STAN
(Walking out)
Whoa dude, you need to mellow out.

Cartman throws the box at Kyle.

CARTMAN
Take you stupid ants in the pants
with you!!!

EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

All the kids are gathered outside, in shock.

DAMIEN
Wow, that kid has some real emotional
problems.

STAN
Aw, he does this all the time.

Chef starts running down the street.

CHEF
Come on, children!! We can still
catch the end of the fight!!!

Pip drops out of the sky.

PIP
Oh, what a splendid party.

INT. SOUTH PARK FORUM - DAY

Jesus is still getting his ass kicked by Satan. Satan is
dancing around, landing blows. Jesus still won't fight.

Jesus takes a smack to the face.

SATAN
Fight Dammit!

COMMERCIAL BREAK #3

The boys run up to Jesus' corner.

STAN
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt
kicked!

Just then, the bell rings. Jesus returns to his corner and
plops down in his seat.

STAN
You've got to FIGHT, Jesus!

JESUS
Why? What's the point? No one believes
in me. Everyone put their money on
Satan... My Father forsaked me...
The Town forsaked me... I'm completely
forsook.

KYLE
SOMEBODY bet on you, Jesus. You said
yourself that one person still has
money on you.

JESUS
It doesn't matter. He's way to strong
for me anyway. I give up.

Stan gets in Jesus' face and starts yelling.

STAN
GOD DAMMIT, JESUS SNAP OUT OF IT!!!

Jesus looks surprised.

STAN
What would Nancy Karrigan do?! HUH?!
Nancy Karrigan wouldn't give up!!
When things were looking their darkest
Nancy Karrigan fought to be the BEST!!

Kyle looks confused.

STAN
She wouldn't stop until she was NUMBER
ONE!!!

KYLE
Uh... Stan...

STAN
Nancy Karrigan wouldn't settle for
second best!!

KYLE
Stan...

STAN
She wouldn't quit until she brought
home the gold!!

KYLE
Stan!!

STAN
What?!

KYLE
Nancy Karrigan got the silver, dude.
She came in second.

Stan thinks for a long time.

STAN
Really?

KYLE
Yeah, dude.

STAN
Oh... Never mind Jesus, Nancy Karrigan
sucks.

The snapping sounds means it's almost time to go back into
the ring. Jesus drinks some water and spits it out.

Now Stan gets right in Jesus' face.

STAN
You know... Somebody once said 'Don't
try to be a great man, just be a
man'.

Jesus thinks for a while.

JESUS
Who said that?

STAN
YOU did Jesus.

Stan puts his hand on Jesus' shoulder. MUSIC swells up. Jesus
gives a little smile and nods.

JESUS
You're right, Stan.

Just then the bell rings.

JESUS
Thank you, boys.

Jesus steps into the ring.

KYLE
Wow, did he say that in the bible?

STAN
No, I saw it on Star Trek.

KYLE
Hmmn.

Jesus and Satan meet in the ring.

Satan takes a couple of shots, Jesus ducks, and the punches
miss.

SATAN
Come on you SISSY! Hit me! Hit me!

JESUS
Okay, pal, YOU ASKED FOR IT!!

Jesus winds up his arm. Stan and Kyle watch intensely. The
Townspeople's eyes get wide...

Finally, Jesus delivers the blow -- He hits Satan EXTREMELY
SOFTLY in the arm. Satan doesn't even flinch.

Stan and Kyle roll their eyes.

But suddenly, Satan grabs his arm --

SATAN
AAAGHH!! YOU GOT ME!!!

Satan falls to the canvas, eyes closed.

REF
ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR!

The Townspeople are in shock.

JIMBO
No way! He barely touched him!

REF
FIVE! SIX! SEVEN! EIGHT!

Satan opens one eye, but doesn't move from the canvas, a
little smile crosses his face.

REF
NINE! TEN! YOU'RE OUT!!!

The bell rings over and over. Jesus throws his hands in the
air and jumps up and down.

STAN AND KYLE
OUR SAVIOR!!!!

ANNOUNCER
The winner by knockout and still
undisputed ruler of your spiritual
kingdom. Jesus Elllllll Saaaavior
Christ.

Just then, Satan gets up, looking just fine.

MR. GARRISON
Hey! He isn't hurt! He took a dive!
He threw the fight!

JIMBO
Yeah.

SATAN
Fools!! You are all fools! Of course
I took a dive! Don't you see -- who
do you think was the ONE PERSON that
bet on Jesus to win?

The townspeople all think.

SATAN
ME you idiots!! And now I will take
all your hard earned money and return
to hell a MUCH RICHER Prince of
Darkness and buy some real estate!
Ha HA HA!!!

Satan dances out of the ring.

PRIEST MAXI
I don't believe this!

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, what a mean thing to do!

SATAN
Farewell fools!!

JIMBO
Man... That guy is a JERK!!

Satan disappears into the ground.

STAN
Jesus TOLD you guys not to bet on
Satan!

MR. GARRISON
Boy, did we get screwed.

CHEF
Jesus, we're sorry... Can you ever
forgive us?

Jesus thinks.

JESUS
Aw, heck, do I have a choice?

JIMBO
Well Jesus, I definitely learned MY
lesson. Never bet on evil, because
when you do -- Ned, look! That's a
rare duck billed platypus! It's comin'
right for us!!!

Jimbo pulls out a gun and blows Kenny's head off.

STAN
OH MY GOD!! THEY KILLED KENNY!!!!

KYLE
You bastard!!!

DAMIEN
Well, goodbye guys, it was nice
getting to know you.

STAN
You're leaving already?

DAMIEN
I have to. My dad's always on the
move.

Damien hangs his head and walks away.

STAN
Wow... I feel kinda bad for that
kid.

KYLE
Yeah, just when he was being accepted
he has to leave and start over.

STAN
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they
realize that what a child needs more
than anything is security?

EXT. CARTMAN'S BACK YARD - DAY

Cartman is sitting at a table by himself surrounded by half
eaten cakes, pies, and all kinds of other crap. Food is all
over the place.

Cartman's face is covered with food, his eyes are half closed.
It looks like a food war has been fought, but actually Cartman
has just gorged himself.

MS. CARTMAN
More pie, hon?

CARTMAN
(Weakly)
No... more... pie...

"MY FUTURE SELF N ME"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, woods, night. Six boys look at a tree stump surrounded
by litter. They are Jimmy, Toke, Craig, Clyde, Kyle, and Cartman.
Kyle is carrying a black trash bag. On the stump is a marijuana
joint and some paper]

KYLE
Throw it away, Clyde!

CLYDE
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it
away.

STAN
What's going on?

KYLE
Some high schoolers left their marijuana
cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw
it away before some kids find it or
something.

STAN
So throw it away.

CLYDE
Nobody wants to touch it.

KYLE
What if the residue gets on our hands
and it leads to harder drugs like those
commercials say.

CRAIG
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial
where it says that if you have pot you
could become a terrorist?

CLYDE
And the commercial where the two kids
have pot and the one kids shoots the
other. Harmless?

STAN
You guys, those commercials are just
exaggerations.

TOKEN
How do you know? None of us had ever
had any drugs before.

JIMMY
Well, I did Ecstacy once.  Me and my
girlfriend took it and we stayed up
all night having... sex.

KYLE
...Where did you have sex with her?


JIMMY
In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank
you. What a terrific audience.

STAN
It's just a stupid plant that makes
you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.


CARTMAN
Then you throw it away, smartass.


STAN
Fine, I will.  There, see? I touched
marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't
shoot anybody, and I don't feel like
doing more drugs now. No big deal.


[South Park, night. To the sound of dramatic music, lightning
relentlessly flashes all over town. Stan's house is shown as
lightning strikes it. In the living room Stan watches "The Osbournes"
with his grandfather. Ozzy is shown in his living room talking
to his kids]

OZZY
You kids  don't  around with your  mom!


JACK
Dad, we ing can't! It's a big ick a


SHARON
Stan, what did I tell you about watching
The Osbournes?

STAN
Aw, come on, Mom.

SHARON
It's going to make you retarded!

STAN
It's just a show! It doesn't have any
fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!


GRANDPA MARVIN
Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.


TOM
In other news, South Park police are
still looking for a craaazy man who
terrorized the town one hour ago.  The
man claimed to be from the future and
ran naked through the city streets screaming
"The past! The past! Oh my God, it's
the past!" Which is what one would expect
someone in the future to yell.

NAKED MAN
Oh my God, it's the past!  Oh, whoa
man, it's you!

SHARON
Who are you?

NAKED MAN
It's me, Mom, your son Stan.

RANDY
Who is it, Sharon?

NAKED MAN
Dad!

RANDY
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you
don't know us! Just go away before we
call the police!

STAN
Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?

NAKED MAN
No way, it's me from the past!

STAN
I'm me from the past?

NAKED MAN
No, I'm you from the future!  Oh man,
this is so messed up.

RANDY
Okay, we've had enough!

NAKED MAN
Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist,
and you don't like chicken. Mom, your
maiden name is Kimble and you have a
scar on your left knee from when you
slipped in the swimming pool.

SHARON
Randy, what's going on?

RANDY
I don't know.

NAKED MAN
Dude, just let me talk to you for like,
five minutes. After that I'll bail.


[The Marsh dining room. The naked man is now dressed in street
clothes and seated at the head of the table. He's emjoying a
beer and regular cigarette. The others look dazed and confused
at the man as he recounts his memories]

FUTURE STAN
I can still remember when I was five
and you both found that squirrel I'd
been keeping in the closet and, you
let me keep it for another week and
then it ran away but... I know that's
just what you told me. I know that Mom
had actually let it out.

RANDY
How could he possibly know all that
unless... he is our son from the future.


SHARON
But why are you back in this time with
us, son?

FUTURE STAN
I have no idea, man. I was just about
to go asleep in an alley behind the
crackhouse,  and I shot up a little
heroin, and then this electrical storm
started. Next thing I knew I was running
around in my own past, man. I thought...
I was just tripping, but then I came
down and I was still here. Oh, dude,
it's so bizarre!

STAN
Oh dude, I should have never touched
that marijuana!

RANDY
Stan, whatever's happened, we going
to help you.

SHARON
That's right. We're a family no matter
what time shift.

FUTURE STAN
Thanks. Can I get another beer?

SHARON
You must be exhausted. Why don't you
get some sleep?

FUTURE STAN
That'd be killer. Where can I crash?


SHARON
Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his
room, would you, Stan?

STAN
What?? I have to share my room with
my future self?? Oh no!

SINGER
Here we are, face to face, "My Future
Self -n- Me"

[Stan and Future Stan stroll down a road. Future Stan has a beer]


STAN
Stop it!

SINGER
So much alike, and yet so different


STAN
No!

SINGER
One of them's messy, the other one's
clean!

[Stan's future self turns off the light while Stan looks pissed
off]

Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree

[Stan's future self brushes his teeth as Stan stands next to
him, avoiding him. Future Stan spits his frothy toothpaste into
the sink]

STAN
Quit it!

SINGER
But in the end we know we're good for
each other

[both Stans eat cereal, but the future Stan has trouble pouring
milk into his bowl. It splashes out of the bowl along with some
cereal. Stan just buries his face in his hands in frustration]


Two peas in a pod, Future Self -n- Me

Future Self -n- Me, Future Self -n-

[Now they have separate beds. Stan turns the light out and tries
to sleep. Future Stan reaches over to turn it on. Stan moves
to turn it on, and they fight over the switch until one of them
sleeps]

Me

[Bus stop, next day. Stan arrives with future Stan]

STAN
Hey guys.

KYLE, CARTMAN
Hey.

FUTURE STAN
Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool
to see you guys.

CARTMAN
Who's this asshole?

STAN
This is my future self. He came during
the electrical storm last night and
is caught in a time matrix. He's me
when I'm 32.

KYLE
Wow. That's pretty cool.

CARTMAN
Then how does he know our names?

KYLE
'Cause, artard, he's Stan from the future.
He knows everything Stan knows.

CARTMAN
Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?


FUTURE STAN
Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years
on a slow downward spiral experimenting
with drugs and alcohol.

STAN
Shut up, Cartman!

CARTMAN
That is so awesome!! Thank you God!
Oh praise God!

KYLE
Hey, what happens to me in the future?


FUTURE STAN
Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away
from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost
touch with you after I was sent to Juvi
Hall in 2006.

CARTMAN
Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's
a loser!

STAN
God-damnit!

[South Park Elementary, after school, Garrison's classroom. Stan
and Butters are seated next to each other, and there are no other
kids around]

STAN
Thanks for staying after school and
tutoring me, Butters.

BUTTERS
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come
you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?


STAN
I told you, I can't stand my future
self. I have to do whatever I can to
not become a loser like him.

BUTTERS
Well, studying is the golden key to
the imposing door of success.

STAN
I just can't stand having my future
self around all the time! It's driving
me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I
won't become him and I won't have to
share my room!

BUTTERS
I know what you mean. I hate having
my future self around, too.

STAN
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...
Wait a minute, what'd you say?

BUTTERS
I said, I know how you feel. My life
has gone completely downhill ever since
my future self moved in. I hate him!
All he ever wants to do is watch Becker.
And that show is so stupid.

STAN
Dude, how long has your future self
been around?

BUTTERS
Oh. I guess it's been around four months
now.

STAN
Four months?? And you never told anybody
that you were living with yourself in
the future??

BUTTERS
Nobody asked.

STAN
Where is he now?

BUTTERS
Probably watching Becker.

[Butters' house, afternoon. A future Butters is watching TV and
eating chips at the sofa]

BECKER
My name is T. Becker. The T stand for
Terrific.

BUTTERS
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future
self, this is my good friend,-

FUTURE BUTTERS
Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing
that puff-ball hat like always.

LINDA
Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's
time to take your liver medicine.


STAN
Liver medicine?

BUTTERS
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney
from all the drinkin' he did in high
school.  Amd I need to learn to behave
myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan?


[Stan's house, moments later. Stan rushes into his room with
Butters in tow]

STAN
Alright, where is that sonofabitch's
wallet?!

BUTTERS
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh
Stan?

STAN
Butters, don't you think it's a little
bit of a coincidence that both your
future self and my future self got caught
in a mexterdexed time plane?

BUTTERS
Well they both got the same teacher
for homeroom, too, but you didn't say
anything then.

STAN
Here it is.  It has to be something
eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires
in two thousand two. Why does he have
this in his wallet?

BUTTERS
I don't follow.

STAN
Three four five one Colfax Avenue.
Come on, Butters.

BUTTERS
Oh! Are we out for an adventure?


[Denver, night. A bus drives up to a curb on the seedy street,
then takes off. Stan and Butters walk down the street]

STAN
Here it is. Motivation Corp.

BUTTERS
I don't think we're supposed to go
in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin'
somewhere else.

STAN
Butters, part of being on an adventure
is you go places you're not supposed
to go.

BUTTERS
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin',
huh Stan?

[Motivation Corp., interior. Stan and Butters look down a long
hallway. Stan notices a window and looks in. Several workers
are at their computers matching kids up with actors who are to
portray their futures selves]

STAN
What the hell is going on here?

A VOICE
It should take about a month to achieve
the results you want.  Well, Mr. and
Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to
be very pleased with the results.


MR. BROOKS
We sure hope so. We just don't know
how to talk to our son about drugs.


DIRECTOR
Well now you won't have to! Ah, here
he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be
playing the role of your future son.


JOSH
Nice to meet you, "Mom and Dad."

MRS. BROOKS
My goodness, he does look a little like
Kevin.

DIRECTOR
Yes, and he knows all your family history
and every detail of your house. And
he's worked up quite a future for your
son.

MR. CASHER
I'm going to tell him that I dropped
out of school and went to prison for
eight years, where I was sodomized.
In the ass.

MRS. BROOKS
Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay
clear of drugs.

MR. BROOKS
Heh it sure should, heh.

DIRECTOR
Alright, then we'll put the fake news
report out on Tuesday night. Make sure
your son is watching the Channel 4 News.


MR. BROOKS
Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the
electrical storm as well?

DIRECTOR
Motivation Corp. takes care of everything.
Just follow these simple scripts when
your actor arrives.

MRS. BROOKS
"Listen to me, you crazy person, there's
no way you can be from the future."
Oh this is going to be fun.

[Motivation Corp., interior. Stan hurries out of there with Butters
close behind.]

STAN
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!


BUTTERS
Yeah, I can't believe it!

STAN
They've all been lying to us this whole
time!

BUTTERS
This whole time! I wonder if my future
self knows anything about this?  Hey,
maybe my future self remembers this
happening, a-and can shed some light
on this subject.

STAN
Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes
aren't our future selves! Our parents
hired them to make us more motivated!


BUTTERS
Eh, but then why did they come back
to the past

STAN
They didn't come back to the past, you
dumbass, they're actors!

BUTTERS
Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're
lyin'

STAN
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied
to you and my parents lied to me! Get
it!

BUTTERS
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor
Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!


STAN
Who's that?

BUTTERS
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of
destruction and disorder!

STAN
What?

BUTTERS
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time
I let you in on a horrible s-secret!


[Butters' house, later. An upper light is on. Butters leads Stan
into his bedroom.]

BUTTERS
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you
may not like what you're about to see.


STAN
We have to teach our parents a lesson!
Show them they can't just play with
our emotions like that!

BUTTERS
Now you know my terrible secret!

STAN
...You're gay?  It's fine if you're
gay, Butters. I don't care.

BUTTERS
Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.


STAN
But we have to teach our parents a lesson,
Butters! We're running away! Help me
find the perfect place to run away to!


BUTTERS
Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too
much silver.

[Stan's room, next day. Stan and Butters are on the floor. Butters
is reading the newspaper as Stan watches on.]

BUTTERS
How about this? Winter Farm. It looks
kinda nice.

STAN
No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.


BUTTERS
Wow, look at this, Stan.  "Are you sick
of your parents? Do you want revenge
for something they've done to you? Call
the Parental Revenge Center of Western
America for a free con-sul-ta-tion.
Results guaranteed."

STAN
Dude, I didn't know there was such
a thing.

BUTTERS
Hey look, somebody lost their pet.


STAN
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge
Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really
pissed off at my parents and I wanna
impose swift and horrible revenge upon
them?

BUTTERS
Look, you can make your weiner bigger
in just three weeks.

STAN
Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you
located, please?  Great, uumm, can I
come by tomorrow?

BUTTERS
This lady'll massage your weiner for
ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty
good deal.

STAN
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you.
That was easy! I just have to go to
their office and they'll help me figure
out how to get back at my parents!


BUTTERS
Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my
douchebag parents, too.

STAN
Fine, then you can come with me.

BUTTERS
Hooray!  And then we can make our weiners
bigger, and have the lady massage them.


[South Park, commercial district. Stan and Butters run down the
street and turn the corner into an alley. Stan checks the address]


STAN
I guess this is it.

[Parental Revenge Center of Western America. The headquarters
are quite shabby. What looks like computers and monitors are
just cardboard boxes with crude drawings on them. Stan and Butters
enter. They look around as they approach the main desk]

STAN
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge
on our parents?

CARTMAN
Yes, come in, please.

STAN
Cartman??

CARTMAN
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it
was you guys.

STAN
What the hell are you doing here?!


CARTMAN
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you
my eleven o'clock?

BUTTERS
You're the Parental Revenge Center of
Western America??

STAN
God-damnit, I knew this was too good
to be true! Come on, Butters, let's
go.

CARTMAN
Eh, so, you don't want to make your
parents suffer and pay for mistreating
you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what
your parents did to you, but if you're
here, I take it they pissed you off
pretty good. Maybe you should at least
...hear what I have to offer?

STAN
Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate
business!

CARTMAN
That it is, I assure you. I started
this business over three months ago
from the ground up. I've beenhelping
children get back at their parents ever
since.

STAN
How many parents have you exacted revenge
upon?!

CARTMAN
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's,
but that was a freebie. Look, I run
a legitimate business hre with state-of-the-art
computers, charts, and technology. Look
around you. I know how it feels to be
really, really pissed off at your parents.
And I will work hard, for you.

STAN
Our moms and dads lied to us about those
future selves! It was just a trick to
get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.


CARTMAN
God-damnit! See? This is exactly why
I started this business. If a parent
can't respect their child, than who
can they respect, huh?

BUTTERS
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Listen! Parents understand one thing,
and that's consequences. They need to
see consequences from their actions,
or else they'll never learn. What my
company does is inflicts those consequences
upon the parents in a very real and
very direct way.

STAN
How much is this going to cost us?


CARTMAN
Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about
just... three hundred and eighty seven
easy payments of a hundred ninety nine,
ninety five.  How about five bucks?


[Motivation Corp., day. ]

DIRECTOR
So, everything is working out with your
future actor? Your son seems to be responding.


RANDY
I think he's pretty scared alright.


SHARON
It's just a little weird having people
lying to our boy like this.

DIRECTOR
Well, you know what us ultra-liberals
say, when it comes to children and drugs,
lies are OK. The ends justify the means.
We'll take smoking, for instance. The
truth is there's no hard evidence that
second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe
it's okay to lie about it as long as
it gets people to stop smoking.

SHARON
Well that makes sense.

DIRECTOR
So it is with everything here at Motivation
Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell
kids that all marijuana supports terrorism.
Or that... one pill of Ecstacy is gonna
kill them. It's not necessarily true,
but the ends justify the means.

RANDY
Well I think when this is all over,
our son is gonna thank us.

[Parental Revenge Center of Western America. Cartman prepares
to lay out his plans for Stan and Butters. His cap is gone, as
is the egg-shell chair.]

CARTMAN
Okay, Butters, let's start with you.
I thnk I've found a great way to get
revenge on your parents. Just... tell
me if I'm going in the right direction
here.  What we're going to do, Butters,
is we're going to wait for your parents
to leave the house, and then, smear
all the walls... with poop.

BUTTERS
Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.


CARTMAN
Now, I want you to take a look at some
of these poop swatches.

BUTTERS
Poop- poop swatches?

CARTMAN
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters.
I wanna find the perfect one, tailored
to your revenge on your parents.

BUTTERS
Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?

CARTMAN
Now, personally, I like the baby green.
But I also think the classic brown
would go nicely with your house.

BUTTERS
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional,
Eric! I don't know which swatch I like
best.

CARTMAN
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh,
uh Butters, is go with the baby green
in the living room, and then maybe a
classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn
crunch in your parents' bedroom.

BUTTERS
Well that sounds good.

CARTMAN
Okay, well let's do that then. That
looks nice.

BUTTERS
Hooray!

CARTMAN
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put
together a really nice design. I feel
your parents were a bit more cocky about
lying to you and your revenge needs
to reflect that. So what I wanna to
is put a note on your parents' door,
telling them I'm the counselor from
the school.

STAN
Yeah.

CARTMAN
The note will inform them that a problem
has come up and they need to see me
right-away, back at my office.

STAN
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Your parents will drive all the way
out to the school and discover that
no meeting is actually taking place.


STAN
Yeah!

CARTMAN
And while they're gone, we're gonna
smear all their walls with poop.


BUTTERS
Wow! Neato!

STAN
That's not neato, that sucks.

CARTMAN
What?

STAN
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's
walls with poop. I thought his revenge
was unique and customized!

CARTMAN
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right
now, Stan, and... have you seen the
poop swatches.

STAN
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My
parents aren't gonna learn their lesson
from having some crap smeared on their
walls! I want them to see what they
did was wrong! I want them to have them
to admit that they lied to me!

CARTMAN
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just,
...my first idea. That's why we have
these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme,
lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this
is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure
your parents out of the house, and then
we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them
up into little pieces and feed them
to the dog

STAN
Dude!

CARTMAN
Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?


STAN
No, that's too extreme!

CARTMAN
Well first it's not extreme enough
and then it's too extreme; where do
you want it?

STAN
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know
what you're doing!

CARTMAN
I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry
about it, Butters. You're gonna be a
hundred percent satisfied.

[The Marsh house, day. All the Marshes are at the dining room
table eating tacos and chips]

STAN
Hey future self.

FUTURE STAN
Yes, former self?

STAN
You know that thing that I kept hidden
in the hold in the wall for two years
that I've never told anybody about?
You know, the thing that I take out
of the shoebox every night before I
go to sleep?

FUTURE STAN
Oh, uh...

STAN
You must know what I'm talking about.


FUTURE STAN
Sure uh, uh,  oh man, could you all
excuse me for a second? I think I'm
gonna crap my pants.

SHARON
Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting
your future self a little?

RANDY
Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.


STAN
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is
from the future.

RANDY
Oh. You. You don't?

STAN
No.  You know what I think? I think
this is all an elaborate hoax!  And
I think that whoever is doing it doesn't
have very much respect for me!  See,
the best way to try to motivate somebody
is by being direct with them, to be
honest with them. I think the whole
futre self thing is a lie, and lies
are never the right way to get your
message across.

RANDY
Well, you know what I think, Stan?


STAN
What?

RANDY
I think he IS from the future.

SHARON
Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I jsut
feel he's our son, you know?

RANDY
Right. That's mother's intuition; you
can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think
the only way you're gonna get of him
is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.


SHARON
Right.

[Butters' house, day. There's a Hispanic crew in the house painting
the walls with two kinds of poop colors. The furniture is covered.
Cartman enters and walks around the living room]

CARTMAN
Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait,
uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic
brown poop is supposed to go in the
parents' bedroom! The living room is
supposed to be all baby green poop!


FELIPE
¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí?

CARTMAN
¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí
es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba
arriba!

FELIPE
¡Sí, sí señor!

CARTMAN
Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos,
no! We want a textured effect on the
nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we
spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle
gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.


CARLOS
Sí. Marrado.

CARTMAN
Marrado. Spectacularrr.

CARLOS
Sí.

CARTMAN
God, it's so hard to find good help.
Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing
so far?

BUTTERS
Boy, it sure is stinky in here!

CARTMAN
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of
poop isn't gonna smell like a garden,
Butters. But I think it's coming together
real nice.

BUTTERS
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin',
my parents are gonna be awful sore and
I don't think-

CARTMAN
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't
I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la
taco la trabajar!

[The Marsh house, night. Randy and Sharon talk with the future
Stan]

FUTURE STAN
Yes, well, it's hard to find work in
commercials, so I ended up-

RANDY
Oh, Stan!

FUTURE STAN
Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you
wanna go upstaris and play hide and
go seek?

STAN
Hide and go seek, huh?!

RANDY
Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs
and play with yourself?

STAN
I don't believe that he's my future
self!

RANDY
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd
better assume he is and never try that
first marijuana cigarette, huh?

STAN
No, I actually have a way to be sure.
I'm going to cut off my hand. If he
is my future self, then his hand will
disappear.

SHARON
S-stanley you don't need to do that.
He-he is your future self.

STAN
But I have to know for sure.

RANDY
Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna
go through life without one of your
hands.

STAN
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first
joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do
it.

RANDY
Stan...

STAN
Yes?

RANDY
Uh... nothing. Go ahead.

SHARON
Randy!

STAN
AAAH!

RANDY
AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His
hand did disappear! He is you from the
future!

FUTURE STAN
Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!

STAN
That's weird, because I really didn't
cut off my hand. It was fake.

RANDY
Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future,
too.

SHARON
Looks like you'd better really watch
out for marijuana, huh Stan?

[Butters' house. Cartman stands with his crew behind him, their
work finished.]

CARTMAN
Well Butters, I hope you like the work.
I'm sure your parents will be plenty
pissed off.

BUTTERS
Uh, and after my parents get angry,
uh how do we get the poop off the walls?


CARTMAN
Ooo, ah, that's a different company.
Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run
out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!


BUTTERS
Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas!


STAN
Butters!

BUTTERS
Oh, Stan!

STAN
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells
in here.

BUTTERS
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of
poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.


STAN
Butters, we're running away!

BUTTERS
We are?

STAN
Our parents are never gonna admit what
they did was wrong, and they're never
gonna change!

CHRIS
What the hell is this?!

LINDA
Oh my God, our house!

BUTTERS
Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now


CHRIS
Butters! Do you have an explanation
for this?!

BUTTERS
Oh, not really sir, I just uh...

LINDA
Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see?
This might be our fault.

CHRIS
What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda.
This is what we get for deceiving our
son.

STAN
Huh?

CHRIS
Butters, listen. The whole future self
thing, well, it was a dirty fib.

LINDA
We just so desperately wanted you to
never try drugs that we used a big scare
tactic instead of ...telling you the
truth.

CHRIS
We though the ends justified the means,
but they don't. They just... don't,
son!

LINDA
We're sorry, baby.

STAN
Get the fuck out of here.

RANDY
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might
be wondering why Butters has a future
self, too.

SHARON
Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time
matrix pulled in more people from the
future.

STAN
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about
Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying
to get you guys to do is admit that
you lied to me!

RANDY
Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying
to make sure you know how dangerous
drugs like pot are.

STAN
I've been told a lot of things about
pot, but I've come to find out a lot
of those things aren't true! So I don't
know what to believe!

RANDY
Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably
isn't gonna make you kill people, and
...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism,
but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel
fine with being bored and... It's when
you're bored that you should be learning
some new skill or discovering some new
science or... being creative. If you
smoke pot you may grow up to find out
that you aren't good at anything.


STAN
I really, really wish you just would
have told me that from the beginning.


SHARON
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations
to keep kids off drugs, then they're
never gonna believe anything we tell
them

RANDY
Well, there's only one person I can
blame. Motivation Corp.!

[Outside Motivation Corp., day. Randy, Sharon, Stan, and Cartman
look at the building and listen at the voices coming out of it]


DIRECTOR
Oh God, who smeared crap all over our
walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!

RANDY
You really did a nice job, Eric.

STAN
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came
through. Thank you. I thought the hangover
black went really nice in the lobby.


SHARON
Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge
box of cookies as a present.

CARTMAN
Thanks. But you know, all this talk
about future selves has made me think,
maybe I should ...take better care of
myself. I mean, maybe I should think
about who I'm going to become.

FUTURE CARTMAN
Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right
choice.

CARTMAN
Who the hell are you?

FUTURE CARTMAN
Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the
future.  I came back to tell you that
this is the day you turn it all around.
You stop eating junk food and you start
studying harder, you stay away from
drugs and alcohol and you become CEO
of your own time-travel company!

CARTMAN
Oh wow, really? That's so awesome!
Now I'll really work to be successful!


FUTURE CARTMAN
Right on!

CARTMAN
Go have sex with yourself, asshole!
I'm not that stupid! Just for that,
I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating
what I waunt, and doin' drugs when I
waunt!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I waunt!


FUTURE CARTMAN
No, wait!  Oh, God-damnit!

"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 502


"CRIPPLE FIGHT"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South park, night. Randy is driving the boys, including Timmy
on the truck bed, through the town. Stuart is with them, but
Kyle is not. The boys are in Scout gear.]

RANDY
Well, you boys must be pretty excited:
your first night of Scouts.

STAN
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be all
like, new kids there we don't know.


KENNY
(Yeah.)

STUART
Well, now, that's part of the fun!


RANDY
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in
Scouts for years.

STAN
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh
yeah, you don't have a dad.

CARTMAN
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!

STAN
Are you excited for your first night
of Scouts, Timmy??

TIMMY
Hyeahahah Timmay!

CARTMAN
Yeah, he's excited.

[Park County Community Center, night, outside shot, then inside
shot. The doors open and the group walks in. A shot of the many
kids inside, then back to the doors. Butters walks up.]

BUTTERS
Uh hey, fellas!

CARTMAN
Hey, Butters.

BUTTERS
Huhboiy, am I glad to see you guys!
There's lots of kids here from other
schools, and I don't know anybody.


RANDY
Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the
bar. We'll be back to pick you up at
nine.

STUART
You boys just make sure to obey the
scout leader now. He's the man in charge.


BIG GAY AL
Hellooo scouts.

STAN
Hey, it's Big Gay Al!

BIG GAY AL
Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you
and your little friends' names on the
list!

TIMMY
Timmay!

RANDY
You're the new scout leader?

BIG GAY AL
I just got transferred in.  I think
everyone's here now, so we can get started.
Come on, Scouts. We've got work to
do!

BOYS
Hooray!

STAN
See ya, Dad!

BIG GAY AL
Hey, are you parents gonna stand there
all night? This meeting is for scouts
only, you silly gooses.  Now, before
we get started, scouts, I want to introduce
you to someone very special here tonight.
He's a brave little boy with disabilities
who proves just by being here that Scouts
are for everyone!

Timmy!	[happily] Timmay!

BIG GAY AL
So let's all give a big round of applause
to little... Jimmy!

JIMMY
Oo-well hello everyoneh.

TIMMY
Jim- Jim-mih?

[The bar, nearby. There's some argument going on inside]

STUART
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's
a bad person, I just don't think he
should be a scout leader!

RANDY
Well he got to where he is by being
a good scout; maybe we should just leave
him alone.

MAN
Well how gay is he?

STUART
He's really, really gay.

TOKEN'S FATHER
Well then, I don't want my boy there,
either.

RANDY
So he's a homosexual. So what?

STUART
I have nothing against homosexuals either,
Randy, but the big camping trip is next
week! Are you sayin' you're fine with
this guy campin' overnight, alone, with
our boys??

SKEETER
You know, boys emulate authority figures.
Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they
could end up all talk and all femmit,
prancin' around like girls.

RANDY
Aw, that's ridiculous.

PRIEST MAXI
People, people, please! You're forgetting
that homosexuality is a choice! As many
of you know, I, myself, went through
a... homosexual... phase. But the light
of Christ showed me how to change. Just
give me two hours with this man, and
I can convert him back.

MAN 2
That's what you said about Peterson,
and then you ended up having sex with
him!

MAN 3
That's right.

MAN 4
You did.

[Community Center gymnasium. The Scouts are well into their first
activities]

BIG GAY AL
And so that's how to make banana-nut
muffins. And now, as a very special
treat, our very special friend Jimmy
is going to do what he loves most: motivational
standup comedy.  Let's give him a big
hand.

JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just
in case you were wondering, I do have
a disability. I am totally happy with
the way I was born, very much. I travel
to different states and talk to kids
about being proud of what they are.
Mm-my mom says that God has a p-plan
for everyone. I guess I was plan B.
You guys like imp-personations?


TIMMY
Timmy.

JIMMY
How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas,
movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh
my God, Mr. Kotter! Uh Mr. Kotter, oh,
oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"

STAN
Jimmy's funny, dude.

BUTTERS
Huh, yeahahah, uhwehell, hehe's the
coolest kid with disabilities in the
world!

TIMMY
Hmph!

STUART
Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.

RANDY
Come on, Stanley.

BIG GAY AL
Oops, guess we're out of time, kids.
Now remember, tomorrow you all have
bake sales in your respective neighborhoods
to raise money. We'll meet back here
next Tuesday, and see who raised the
most. Good luck.

STAN
Hey, I have a great idea. Why don't
we see if Jimmy wants to come be in
our Scout club?

CARTMAN
Hey yeah!

TIMMY
Uh Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy.

STAN
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake
sale in South Park tomorrow?

JIMMY
Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks,
fellas.

RANDY
Come on, Stan.

STAN
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.


KENNY
(Yeah, see ya)

STAN, CARTMAN
Bye, Jimmy.

JIMMY
See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.


[Randy's truck, night. Randy is taking the boys home.]

STAN
You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!


KENNY
(Yeah!)

STAN
We told ghost stories, a-and learned
how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!


CARTMAN
Yeah, and we learned how to make cakes
and muffins for our bake sale.

STAN
And best of all, we met this kid named
Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't
let it ruin his life! He's awesome!


TIMMY
Timmih!!!

CARTMAN
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise
money in our bake sale.

STAN
Cartman, don't say "use him," you big
thilly goose.

TIMMY
Wa-ah!

RANDY
What did you say?!

STAN
I just... called Cartman a name - he's
a, he's a silly goose.

STUART
Uh huh!

RANDY
YOU DO NOT SAY "BIG SILLY GOOSE!!" You
call him an asshole like a normal kid!!


STAN
But dad, I was just tryin' tuh-

RANDY
STANLEY, YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND AN ASSHOLE
THIS INSTANT!!!

STAN
...Asshole.

RANDY
That's better!

CARTMAN
Don't call me an asshole, you sonofabitch.


STAN
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale
to raise money for scout troop number
four seven. Uh, please stop by and give
us a hand. And now, for your entertainment,
our new best friend, stand-up comic
Jimmy!

JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience. I just flew
into South Park. Boy, are my crutches
tired!  What a terrific audience. You
know, sometimes people ask me, "Are
you angry at God for making disabled
people?" I say, "No, I think the world
is better with puh-President Bush."


SHARON
What a brave little boy.

KYLE'S MOTHER
He's able to use comedy to overcome
his handicap! I LOVE him!

JIMMY
Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting
people here in South Park.  Hhh-how
about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? "Goddamnit!
God-. No, Kitty, that's my mud pie!
Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"

STAN
Heheh.

CARTMAN
I don't sound like that.

JIMMY
And how about that school counselor?
"Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."  "Uh. Drugs
are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs
are bad, okay? Okay?"  Wow, what a great
audience. "Mr. Hat. Be queit, Mr. Hat.
Mr.-"  "Hello there, children. Mr. Hat.
Hello- Mr. Hat"  "I'm making Salisbury
steak for lunch."  "Salisbury steak
for lunch." Eb. Uh. "Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"
And of course, my very favorite, "Timmy!
Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, uh, living a lie!
Uh living a lie, Timmy!"  "Ti- Timmy,
uh living a lie. Heh, heh. Eh Tih- ahah
Timmy." Heh. Sometimes it's like, "Please,
Timmy, learn a new word," heh. "Timmy!
Tu-Timmy!"

TIMMY
Aaaaaaah!

JIMMY
Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy,
I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really
take the cay. I really take the k-keh
cake.

MAN
Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my!

TIMMY
Tiiimm-mmiiih!!!!!

[State Mountain Scouts of America headquarters, day, outside
shot. Inside, three men sit behind a table - a tribunal.]

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Well, this is it. We've simply gotten
too many complaints from concerned parents
about him. I'm afraid we don't have
a choice.

BIG GAY AL
Hiya fellas!

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
How are you today, Scout?

BIG GAY AL
I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops
are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased
to report that we have already raised
over $600 for the event. Yippie!

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Oh. Big Gay Al, it has recently come
to our attention that you are... gay.


BIG GAY AL
Well, stop the presses, did you figure
that out all by yourselves, silly buns?


SCOUTMASTER 1
Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the
Scouts have a policy that openly gay
men cannot belong.

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
We are left with no options, Mr. Al.
I'm afraid you are hereby... out of
Scouts.

BIG GAY AL
Out of... Scouts?

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al.

BIG GAY AL
But I've been in Scouts since I was
nine - it's a... huge part of my life.


SCOUTMASTER 2
Uh you must understand that Scouts is
a private club. A club that follows
certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs
is that homosexuality is immoral.


BIG GAY AL
I see...

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
It's nothing against you personally


BIG GAY AL
Wull what if I promise not to be gay
anymore?  Pinky swear.

SCOUTMASTER 2
We think it's best you just... move
on.

BIG GAY AL
Right. Move on.

[South Park streets, day. Timmy sits on the sidewalk as Jimmy
ambles towards him.]

JIMMY
Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called,
very much. I've been detecting some
a-animosity towards me lately, and I
was hoping we could bury the hatchet.


TIMMY
Timmih.

JIMMY
What's that?

TIMMY
Hur livin' a lah, Timmih.

JIMMY
A present? You got me a p-present?


TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
... Gee, you didn't have to do that.
I mean, I understand why you've been
jealous of my talent.  If you work at
it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable
as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you
didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.

TIMMY
Tim-Timmy.

JIMMY
Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits.  This
is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim.
Well, I'll see you around.

TIMMY
Timmih!

[As Jimmy walks, suspense music comes up. Jimmy reaches the corner,
and a safe falls from above and cracks the sidewalk behind him.
He crosses the street, and a truck plows into an oncoming car
and jackknifes, sending the car backwards through the air. Jimmy
is untouched. An eagle tries to swoop him up, but misses. Jimbo
and Ned appear atop a building across the street]

JIMBO
There he is! Kill him! Kill him!  Oh,
wait, that's not him.

[Some glass blows out from a window next to Jimmy, followed by
a blast of fire, and Jimmy walks. He crosses the second street
and a herd of cattle stampede past him. He continues down the
road, and a space shuttle crashes into the sidewalk, nose first.]


JIMMY
Thanks again, Tim-Tim.

TIMMY
Tim-Timmay!

[Big Gay Al's house, night. Quite colorful front lawn, with fountain,
flowers, a flower strip down the middle of the driveway. Soft
music plays. Inside, Al sits on his bed looking over framed photos
of his Scouting career. Scout Troop 417 - 1988, Camp White Swallow
- 1974, his Scout medals, a picture of a black man dresed as
Superman. Al sighs and looks over at his Scout uniform. He walks
over and takes it down, then walk to his dresser and puts the
uniform away in one of its drawers]

BIG GAY AL
Hm, bye, Scouts.  Okay, okay, Marc,
stop playing now.

MARC
Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to
come over and play sad songs for you
to pack to, and then ya yell at me.


BIG GAY AL
I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed
everything wawy, so just... well, play
something uplifting, like... "I'm gonna
put all this behind me and make it okay"
music.

MARC
Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have
her. She's too fat for me.

BIG GAY AL
Ogh!  Jesus, Marc.

[Park County Community Center, night. A group of men stand outside.
The head Scoutmaster exits the building with a big, beefy, decorated
Scout leader]

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Parents, this is the new Scout leader,
Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over
for the homosexual.

RANDY
Nice to meet you.

MR. GRAZIER
Marsh, right? We kind of actually know
each other. Your wife and mine are friends.


STUART
Your wife, huh?

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain
Scouts troop.

STUART
Well, I guess we're off to the bar
until nine, then.

MR. GRAZIER
Gonna go pound some brews, huh?

[Inside, Jimmy entertains the troops with more of his comedy
skit as the men talk outside]

JIMMY
And so I said to him, "Hey, ah-I may
be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."
Wow, what a terrific audience. Well,
for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer
from the audience, very much. How about
you, Timmy?

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy,
ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him
a hand, very much. Come to think of
it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here,
Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just
for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk,
Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!

TIMMY
Timmih!

CARTMAN
Cripple fight!

MR. GRAZIER
That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats!


CARTMAN
Awww!

MR. GRAZIER
Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout
Master, Mr. Grazier!  Together we are
going to become the best! The sleekest!
The most polished Scout troop in all
of Colorado! Isn't that right!  When
I ask you a question you will answer
"Yes, Scoutmaster!" Do I make myself
clear!

SCOUTS
Yes, Scoutmaster!

MR. GRAZIER
Good! Now, the first activity for this
evening will be...  naked pictures
I'm going to take some pictures of each
of you naked, in case we need them,
for later.

SCOUTS
Awww.

MR. GRAZIER
Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing
I hate, it's a whining platoon! "We
don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna
get up early! We don't wanna have you
take naked pictures of us!"

CARTMAN
Man, this guy sucks.

MR. GRAZIER
Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!


[Community Center gym, later. The pictures have been taken and
the Scouts are dressed and at table.]

MR. GRAZIER
Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this
meeting with a little puppet show.
Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared.
He's always ready. Now, here's a little
Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier
took naked pictures of him. Look what
happens.  Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw!  Do I
make myself clear, Scouts!

SCOUTS
Yes, Scoutmaster!

MR. GRAZIER
Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's
all the time we have for tonight, Scouts.
We sure had a great time, didn't we?


SCOUTS
Yes sir Scoutmaster!

RANDY
Wow, you sure whipped those kids into
shape.

STUART
Yeah. Now they're acting like men.


MR. GRAZIER
Well, you know what I say about kids:
They're all pink on the inside.

RANDY
You bet.

STUART
I heard that.

RANDY
See ya, Mr. Grazier.

[Big Gay Al's house, night, living room. Al is on the couch unkempt,
covered in a blanket, watching TV, and devouring ice cream. The
door bell rings]

BIG GAY AL
Go away! I'm dead.

BUTTERS
Oh, well, here he is.

STAN
Big Gay Al, what are you doing??

CARTMAN
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch
and come be our scoutmaster again!


BIG GAY AL
I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out
of Scouts.

STAN
Kicked out? Oh no!

CARTMAN
But you have to come back. We hate our
new scout leader.

BIG GAY AL
Really? Oo-why?

BUTTERS
We can't tell you.

BIG GAY AL
Why not?

BUTTERS
Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no!


STAN
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go
on a camp trip with this guy.next week.


BIG GAY AL
Boys, umph, there's nothing I can do.
The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.


JIMMY
Well then that settles it! Fellas, what
we're gonna hafta do is try to ch...
change the Scouts' rules, very much.


STAN
What do we want?

BOYS
Gays in Scouts!

STAN
When do we want it?

TIMMY
Timmih!

STAN
What do we want?

BOYS
Gays in Scouts!

STAN
When do we want it?

TIMMY
Timmih!

STAN
What do we want?

RANDY
Oh, no.

BOYS
Gays in Scouts!

STAN
When do we want it?

TIMMY
Timmih!

[South Park streets, day, further down the street. The six boys
continue picketing.]

STAN
What do we want?

BOYS
Gays in Scouts!

STAN
When do we want it?

TIMMY
Timmih!

STAN
Alright, this looks like the perfect
place to get some signatures.

LITTLE GIRL
Puppies. Puppies for sale.

CARTMAN
Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination
work to do!

STAN
Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're
here to collect signature in support
to force the Scouts to accept gays?
Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit!


BUTTERS
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some
stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale,
very much?

STAN
That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies
and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment,
stand-up comic, Jimmy!

JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience. For my
first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer.
Come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, when
I tell you to do something, you do it!


TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!


TIMMY
Timmay!

JIMMY
Put on the hat!

TIMMY
TIMMAY!

JIMMY
Pu-put it on!!

STAN
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly.


TIMMY
Timmih. Timmih.

JIMMY
Not this year.

TIMMY
Timmih Timmh.

CARTMAN
Cripple fight!

TIMMY
Haaa.

JIMMY
Coem on. Come on!

TIMMY
Timmih.

[South Park Church. A service is on, and organ music plays]


CARTMAN
CRIPPLE FIGHT!!!

[Henry's Supermarket, inside. Shoppers mill about, getting their
items]

CARTMAN
Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have...
cripple fight. Cripple fight outside!


[Parking lot. Timmy delivers the fist blow, to Jimmy's head,
but Jimmy delivers four blows back with his crutches. The third
one turns Timmy's head to the left. The fourth one turns Timmy's
head to the right and forces the wheelchair backwards. Jimmy
recovers and the rivals approach each other anew]

JIMMY
Come on!

[Jimmy jumps up and delivers a blow to Timmy's face, but Timmy
responds with four quick blows - a right hook, two left jabs,
and another right hook - sending Jimmy to the ground face first.]


JIMMY
Man.

STAN
Jesus Christ, dude!

WOMAN
Oh my God!

MAN
Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll
run out of steam soon.

TIMMY
Hahnay Timmih.

JIMMY
Huah!

TIMMY
Hahnay Timmih.

JIMMY
Come on!

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
No!  Ow!

[Jimmy recoups and delivers a back-handed blow to Timmy with
his right crutch, then measures Timmy and swings the crutch back
and launches Timmy out of his chair. Timmy quickly scrambles
back to his chair, but Jimmy whacks him away again. Camera movements
get more dynamic. Timmy rolls over and Jimmy walks up to him
and offers his left hand]

JIMMY
Timmy? Timmy?

I told you to put on the HAT!! [swings his right crutch and blows
Timmy out of the chair again. Jimmy walks up to Timmy and pulls
him up by the hair, and swings the right crutch at him, but Timmy
blocks it and holds both crutches down]

You dirty motherfucker! [hits Timmy with the crutches, and Timmy
responds with a headbutt, knocking Jimmy down. Timmy goes down
himself]

MAN 2
What's goin' on?

MAN 3
Some kind of gay pride rally.

[Timmy gets a hold of Jimmy and delivers a right cross. Jimmy
responds by striking Timmy with both crutches, then grounding
his crutches and swinging his legs up to strike Timmy agian.
Next, Jimmy tries to pull Timmy off the wheelchair head first,
then tries to get a reverse headlock on Timmy. Timmy breaks out
of it and delivers a blow. They each try a headlock on the other,
but the effort forces the wheelchair backwards, and they both
fall out.]

TIMMY
Lah-livin' a lie!

[Jimmy chokes Timmy for a bit, then rises to jump on him. Timmy
tries to force Jimmy off by pushing Jimmy's face back, but Jimmy
bites Timmy's fingers. Timmy cries in pain, then flips Jimmy
off overhead. Jimmy scrambles up on his crutches as Timmy tends
to his bitten hand, and strikes Timmy again, and again. Jimmy
then swings his legs into Timmy and flies off - a flying kick.
Timmy rises and jumps on Jimmy, grabbing his head and ramming
it into the ground twice, then performing an eye gouge. Jimmy
works around it and throws Timmy off, then jumps on him, driving
a knee into Timmy's crotch five times, shot from various angles.
Jimmy struggles to get up, and Timmy trips him.]

[Channel 4 News report]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's
Supermarket where five brave little
boys are holding a rally to support
gays in scouting. The rally is drawing
so much attention that people all over
the country are taking media notice.


FARMER
Those boys have shown me the light.
Uh I never knew the Mountain Scouts
was a hate group.

JOE
This is a wake up call to America.
We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!


[South Park Bar. People are looking at the report]

RANDY
Oh, God, they're actually pulling it
off.

Reporter	[voice only] The rally has also caught the attention
of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such
films as Always and 1941.

[Cut to Channel 4 News report]

STEVEN SPIELBERG
I salute those boys and their courage.
I am hereby cutting all my funding to
the Scouts!

REPORTER
The rally has also caught the attention
of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.


GLORIA ALLRED
It is a disgrace that these homophobes
are allowed to discriminate.  I am taking
this case on, personally!

REPORTER
With this kind of support, Tom, these
boys are sure to have a victory for
gays. Back to you.

TOM
Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI
has finally caught the child molester
known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick
child molester was found with disturbing
graphic photos of young boys naked,
which we will show you now.

[Cut to South Park Bar for reactions. The men are stunned]

TOM
Here's one. And here's another.

STUART
Kenny?

RANDY
Oh my God.

TOM
Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch!
Here's one right here.

[Jimmy and Timmy have taken to throwing each other all over the
place. Jimmy and Timmy land on a car and tumble down to the ground
beside it. The camera follows the action closely. Jimmy picks
Timmy up and throws him back on the car, then swings his right
crutch at Timmy, striking him, and strikes him again on the return
swing. Timmy punches Jimmy with his left fist, sending Jimmy
spinning around. Jimmy swings at Timmy again, but Timmy ducks
and catches Jimmy in a sleeper hold, holding on for a few seconds.
Jimmy escapes, then picks Timmy up high and brings him down upon
the left knee for a back-breaker. Timmy rises and responds with
a neck-breaker, knocking Jimmy out. Both boys lay there, motionless.]


MAN
Alright, boys, break it up.

[Colorado Supreme Court, day, exterior shot. Inside, the justices
enter and take their seats]

BAILIFF
All rise.

CHIEF JUSTICE
In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain
Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming
show of support, it is the ruling of
this court that the Scouts must allow
Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!


CROWD
Alright! Yeah! Woohoo!

RANDY
Well, we'va all learned an important
lesson. That just because somebody's
gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest
children. Straight people do that too.


CROWD
Yeah!

CHIEF JUSTICE
And furthermore, the Scout elders will
be put into stocks for three days, so
they can see how it feels to be outcast!


CROWD
Hooray, yeah, yeahah!

STAN
We did it! We did it!

GLROIA ALLRED
I did it! I did it! Haha!

[Colorado Supreme Court, day, outside. Gloria Allred is holding
a press conference at the top of the steps at the courthouse]


GLORIA ALLRED
Today is a great day for democracy.
The Scouts have been exposed for the
vile gay bashers they are.  And we all
it all to me, and these six brave little
boys  five... brave little boys. And
now, here to take his official oath
back in Scouts is Big Gay Al.

BIG GAY AL
Thank you all very much. But I don't
want this.

CROWD MEMBERS
What's he saying?

STAN
Huh?

BIG GAY AL
Look, I appreciate what you kids did;
really, I really do. But this isn't
what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay.
And I'm proud to be in a country where
I'm free to express myself. But freedom
is a two-way street. If I'm free to
express myself, then the Scouts have
to be free to express themselves, too.
I know these men. They are good men.
They are kind men. They do what they
think is best for kids. No matter how
wrong we think they might be, it isn't
right for us to force them to think
our way. It's up to us to persuade,
and help them see the light, not extort
them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts'
funding. The Scouts help and have always
helped a lot of kids. That's why I love
them. I will continue to persuade them
to change their mind, but this is the
wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby
dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts
their right to not allow gays into their
private club.

MAN
Uh, uh, HOORAY!

ANOTHER MAN
Hooray, hey!

STAN
So wait, did we do good?

BUTTERS
Uh yeah, ah I think so.

CARTMAN
Eh, we kick ass.

BIG GAY AL
Come on kids, let's go get some ice
cream!

GLORIA ALLRED
You can't do this! You homophobe!


JIMMY
Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important
lesson, too, very much. There is room
for more than one handi-capable person
in Scouts.

TIMMY
Timmih.

JIMMY
I'm glad we're best friends now. See
ya at Scouts.

TIMMY
Tim-mih.

TIMMY
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih
Timmih Timmih.  Timmih Timmih Timmih
Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Aaaaah.


STAN
Dude, Timmy, come on! We're gonna be
late for Scouts!

[Park County Community Center, day. Inside the boys are seated
around the table, and a new Scoutmaster, the head Scoutmaster,
is present]

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader.
Everything is going to be just fine.
No naked pictures.

TIMMY
Uh, Timmih.

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
Yes, Timmy?  Oh dear. Jimmy?

JIMMY
Yes?

HEAD SCOUTMASTER
You know our policy: I'm afraid you're...
out of Scouts.

JIMMY
Out of Scouts?

TIMMY
Tim-mih.

Jimmy	Huh w-what? [the two other Scoutmasters come up behind
Jimmy, pull him out of his chair, and carry him towards the entrance]
Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!

STAN
Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.

BUTTERS
Me neither.

JIMMY
No! No!

TIMMY
Timmiiih!!!

Episode 507


"PROPER CONDOM USE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, day. A car with a woman seated in it appears on
a hill  Jennifer Lopez doll with car, and some damage from the
firecracker last time.]

STAN
"So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"


KYLE
"No, no, please! This time I swear
I won't make albums or movies."

STAN
"That's what you said last time , but
obviously we must now resort to more
drastic measures"

KYLE
"Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"


STAN
"Scream for me, bitch!"

KYLE
"AAAAAAAH!"

STAN, KYLE
Whoa! Awesome!

CARTMAN
Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you
guys, come check this out!

STAN
Oh no, what now?

CARTMAN
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come
on!

[Kenny's house, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle approach the house.
Kenny's on the front lawn with a dog, and the other boys join
him]

KYLE
What's this all about, Kenny?

KENNY
(Wait until you see what I can do to
the dog!)

CARTMAN
Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere,
dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket
red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.
Come on.

STAN
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?


CARTMAN
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.


KYLE
No they don't!

KENNY
(Yeah they do!)

CARTMAN
Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth
graders showed us how to do it.  Red
rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh


STAN
Whoa, cool!

KYLE
That's awesome!

CARTMAN
I told you guys.

STAN
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it
again.

CARTMAN
Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once
every few hours. It doesn't work if
you beat off the dog again right away.


KYLE
You "beat off?"

CARTMAN
That's what it's called when you milk
a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys
know anything?

STAN
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth
graders?

CARTMAN
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool,
so they showed us how to do it-hey come
here, dog. Dog, come here!

[Stan's house, night. Sharon is holding court in the living room,
in a circle of chairs. She and Randy have eight guests over for
some discussion...]

SHARON
I was really happy with this month's
book. I agree with what Bob and Linda
said-

STAN
Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

SHARON
Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and
Daddy's book club night, remember?


STAN
But it's super-cool!

SHARON
Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself
enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.

MAN
Uh the first chapter alone was filled
with poetry.

SHARON
Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence:
"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"
"-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."
It's amazing how with three images
he puts you right there, and...

STAN
Red rocket, red rocket!

RANDY
WAAAH!

SHARON
Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!


STAN
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket,
red rocket.

SHARON
STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT
NOW!

STAN
My room? Why?

SHARON
Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he,
he gets very good grades.

[Stan's house, later. His parents have entered his room, quite
upset at his behavior earlier. Stan rests his head on his hands.]


SHARON
Stanley, do you know why you're being
grounded for ten months?

STAN
No!

RANDY
Beating off the dog is not appropriate
when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever!
Beating off the dog is not appropriate
ever!

STAN
Why?! What's the big deal?!

SHARON
Stanley, don't you understand what you
are doing??

STAN
I was doing "red rocket" to make the
dog's milk come out.

RANDY
No, Stan! What you were doing to the
dog was-ss sexual.

STAN
Huh??

SHARON
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley!
What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!


RANDY
Well, you know, when you do that to
a m-male... the... eh eh you make his...
stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't
they taught you these things at school?!


STAN
What things??

SHARON
Sexual education. Haven't you learned
that yet?

STAN
No!

SHARON
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,...
Well, your school should be teaching
this stuff!

RANDY
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on
the phone!

[South Park PTA meeting, night. The parents are there, clamoring
and arguing. ]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want
a chance to speak, but we have to talk
one at a time.

SHARON
Look, our kids are learning sexual
things on the street and on television.
There's no way we can stop it. The schools
have to teach them sexual education
at a younger age.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
School policy has been to teach sexual
education later. In the fifth grade.


MR. TWEEK
It isn't soon enough.

STUART
Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son
was caught beatin' off our dog.

CHEF
Look, parents. Do you really want your
children learning about sex? Part of
the fun of being a kid is being naive!
Let them be kids for a while.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we
have to face facts: Children in America
are having sex at younger and younger
ages. STDs are affecting younger and
younger kids all the time. The only
way we can combat that is by educating
children before they have sex.

CHEF
The first thing that kids learn about
sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic
about STDs.

KYLE'S MOTHER
No, she's right! With all the teen
pregnancies that are out today, I think
my boy does need to know about sexual
education.  From the school.

ADULTS
Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.

[South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Garde B" is shown on a classroom
door. Sixteen boys are present.]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay, boys, this is the first day of
sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know
that some of you think this is very
funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina."
Nuh now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin'
tuh get through this by being mature
and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the
male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the
testes and the scrotum.  STOP that,
m'kay! The next person that laughs is
gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in
order to have intercourse, the man takes
his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh...
let's see: the the man takes his penis,
and he... hm.

STAN
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse,
Mr. Mackey?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well, sure I have! It's just... I was
about 19 at the time, so it's been about
21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...
I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took
the penis, and I bu- uh what the hell
did I do with that damned thing??


[South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Garde" is shown on a classroom
door  this is Ms. Choksondik's room. Twelve girls are present.]


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright girls, even though this may
be stuff you don't want to hear, you
need to hear it.

WENDY
Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik.
We're excited.

BEBE
Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!

GIRLS
Yeah!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's
start with our first lesson, then, shall
we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTTED DISEASES!!
That's right, because unless you get
boys to wear condoms you can and will
get a sexually transmitted disease from
them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that
fun?

WENDY
I didn't mean that-

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Today over 20,000 Americans will contract
a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand
more tomorrow! And the reason is that
you girls wake up in the morning and
say, "It's not going to happen to me."
You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens
to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but
not here in Colorado." WRONG!  Gonorrhea,
herpes, clamydia, HPV, HIV, syphillis,
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes
on and on! These are serious diseases!
They have serious consequences!  You
think that sex is about fun and games
and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease!
Here's a little picture of herpes.


GIRLS
AAAHHH!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
And here's a little syphillis for you!


GIRLS
AAAHHH!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
That's right, girls. Here's what happens
when you don't get boys to use condoms!


[The school kitchen, lunch.]

CHEF
Hello there, children.

BOYS
Hey Chef.

CHEF
How is sexual education class going?


STAN
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach
us nothin'.

CHEF
Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows
a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik?
I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten
laid in her life.

KYLE
Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?

CHEF
...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children,
you're holdin' up the line.

[The school cafeteria, moments later. The boys exit the kitchen.
Behind them are Tweek, Butters, Kevin and Timmy.]

KYLE
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what
they learned in sex ed.

STAN
Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-


GIRLS
AAAAHHH!

KYLE
What the hell is wrong with them?


STAN
You guys, we just wanna know if you-


GIRLS
AAAAHHH!

WENDY
Stay away from me, Stan!

STAN
Why?

WENDY
Are you wearing a condom?

STAN
...A what?

GIRLS
AAAAHHH!

BEBE
Do any of you have your condoms on?


KYLE
No.

GIRLS
AAAAHHH!

WENDY
Don't you know that without wearing
a condom you could get a disease?


KYLE
Nuh uh.

BEBE
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom,
you're gonna get AIDS.

CARTMAN
AIDS?

BUTTERS
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS,
fellas.

KYLE
Is that what you learned in sex ed?


CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about
that.

STAN
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything
about anything.

WENDY
You guys have to wear condoms. Now,
please, just, just go away. We don't
want your AIDS.

STAN
But Wendy, we don't understand how
thatt-

GIRLS
AAAAHHH!

KYLE
Oh my God, dude.

BUTTERS
Uh what are we gonna do, huh?

STAN
Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.


BOYS
Yeah.

PHARMACIST
Can I help you boys?

STAN
Yeah, we need condoms!

PHARMACIST
Condoms.

KYLE
Yeah. Quick!

PHARMACIST
How old are you boys?

STAN
Why does that matter?

BUTTERS
Ha-I'll be nine next week.

PHARMACIST
Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.


KYLE
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?


PHARMACIST
I just don't think kids your age should
be-

ASSISTANT
Mark, we have to be willing to supply
condoms to anyone who requests them.


MARK
But... they're... children!

ASSISTANT
Would you rather them do it unprotected?


CARTMAN
Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!


MARK
I just think that all this sex ed and
condom talk in elementary school is
wrong!

ASSISTANT
Kids are going to do what they do, and
it's up to us to make sure they're protected.


STAN
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.


MARK
I don't think we have any that'll even
fit them!

ASSISTANT
Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators
for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially
designed for kids under 10, and they're
only five ninety five for a box of fifty.


BUTTERS
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same
one every day?

ASSISTANT
No, you have to change it.

KYLE
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons
of these things.

[Ms. Choksondik's house, night. Mr. Mackey has come by for a
visit. Books sit on two tables and the floor]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh thanks so much for letting me come
over, Ms. Choksondik.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's
probably best we come up with a lesson
plan together anyway.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yeah I've already gone over most of
the basics, you know, uh with the boys,
but I uh... eh just wanted to see what
else you were teaching the girls, in
case I... "missed" anything.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well we should make sure our students
are good and scared of the consequences.
We have to teach them that diseases
are possible even with just oral sex.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Right! Oral sex, which of course would
be...

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
It's just too bad these girls are having
sex so young.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yeah, why d-uh, did you?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Did I what?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well uh, how long did you wait before
you had... uh... doobers.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat
of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of
it!  I wasn't sought after much in high
school or college.  I was made fun of
most of my life for having such large
glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever
had was this attractive popular boy
named Steven Garrett. I liked him very
much, but I... found out that he was
dating me because he lost a bet on the
Superbowl. The loser had to go out with
me for three days.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
People can be very cruel. Anyway, I
know it's hard to understand.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Ah actually I understand perfectly.
I... I wasn't exactly the captain of
the football team, either, huh huh,
hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got
older my... my head just sorta seemed
to get bigger while the rest of my body
stayed the same. That's how I got my
nickname in college.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Your nickname?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
"That guy with the really big head."


MS. CHOKSONDIK
...Right.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence
and fourd it possible to ever ask a
woman out, mm, hm mm.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Wow, I've... never met a man who is...
as sexually unappealing as me.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Neither have I.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, I'm quite happy without sex.
I mehean, with all the diseases and
problems out there, who needs it, right?


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, back to the lesson plan, then.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Right.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay.  "Oral Sex"

[Bus stop, day. The boys are gathered there waiting...]

STAN
Doesn't it give any other directions?


BUTTERS
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed
to roll it over your weiner.  "If used
properly, latex condoms are effective
against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"


KYLE
Uh, what are "studzes"

BUTTERS
How the heck should I know?  Why, it's
just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all
gooey.

CARTMAN
Just put it on, Butters.

BUTTERS
Ha-a how come I gotta go first?

CARTMAN
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?


BUTTERS
Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h,
it's sticky.

KYLE
It says you gotta check it for holes
or tears.

BUTTERS
I don't even understand how this thing...
ooh, wait. Oh, I see.

STAN
Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!


CARTMAN
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was
seeing how to put the condom on!

KYLE
Sure.

BUTTERS
But it won't stay on. I I need a rubber
band or somethin'.

TWEEK
Ah I got rubber bands.

BUTTERS
Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There.
Okay, I think it's on.

STAN
How do you feel?

BUTTERS
...Pretty good.

CARTMAN
Do you feel protected?

BUTTERS
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin'
in my weiner through this thing? A-and
it's even got a little reservoir at
the end so you can... pee in it.

STAN
Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give
everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's
gotta help Timmy put his condom on.


TIMMY
Timmehah!

[South Park Elementary, day. Principal Victoria has called the
teachers together in her office. Chef is there as well.]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Teachers, I have some bad news. Last
night I received a phone call from the
local pharmacist. Apparently, almost
all of our fourth graders are sexually
active. And now that we've scared them
a little they're buying condoms to use.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
I knew it! Well, at least we scared
them enough to protect themselves. But
now maybe you'll believe me when I say
that we need to be teaching even younger
than fourth grade.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But how old do you think a student should
be when they learn about proper condom
use?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
...Kindergarten.

CHEF
Kindergarten?!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
We've got to get to the students before
they start having... sex. Nu-not after.


CHEF
Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!


MR. ADLER
I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik.
It's our responsibility to make sure
our kids are safe if they're gonna screw
around.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I guess we have no choice.

[Kindergarten, next day.]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, who can tell me what
a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?

JENNY
It flies around and it's endangered.


MR. GARRISON
That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms
are what we use to stop the spread of
STDs.  Yes, Filmore?

FILMORE
Can we do fingerpaint?

MR. GARRISON
NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids
wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a
nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now
pay attention, alright? I'm going to
show you the proper way to put on a
condom.  First of all you remove the
condom from its package.  Then you find
which way the condom rolls out.  Put
it in your mouth...  And apply.  And
it's as simple as that. Any questions?


[Ms. Choksondik's classroom, same time.]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright girls. Yesterday we went over
the myriad of diseases you can get from
boys, but today we're going to talk
about the most horrible they can give
you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right,
since you girls have decided to be sexually
active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time
high! You seem to think it's gonna be
fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's
watch a little video, shall we?!


NARRATOR
Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle
of Child Birth.  The time is drawing
close for delivery. Here we can see
the water breaking.

GIRLS
Eeeeww.

NARRATOR
Later, the contractions are happening
closer together. Mom sure is in a lot
of pain. Now we can see the crown of
the baby's head, stretching the vaginal
walls in ways never before thought possible
by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens,
and the baby is born.  but Mom's not
done yet.

GIRL
Eeww.

NARRATOR
She still got some afterbirth to push
out of her.

GIRLS
AAAAAAAA!!!!

NARRATOR
That's right.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Girls! Girls! Where are you going?!


[Mr. Mackey's class, later. Some of the boys, including Stan
and Kyle, have their hands over their crotches.]

STAN
Man, this condom's driving me crazy.


KYLE
Yeah. I've changed mine three times
already 'cuase it itches so much.


CARTMAN
Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom
easier.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Alright, boys, I now have all the information
I need to teach you the female anatomy,
hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the
vaginal opening.  This is where the
man puts his- Eric, what the hell are
you doing?

CARTMAN
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled
the other one up.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Why are you wearing a condom?

CARTMAN
So I don't get AIDS.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting
around, you have to get it from sex.


STAN
From sex??

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yes.

KYLE
You mean, intercourse with a girl?


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yes! Now will you all pay attention,
please?! The vagina and the clitoris
are on the outside, and they are in
fact very easily visible to the naked
eye.

STAN
All this time... It's the girls that
give us diseases!

CARTMAN
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right
to your face!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Now here we can see the interior female
anatomy. Things like the uterus and
the ovaries are on the inside

KYLE
Well that does it! If us boys are going
to live, we have to get rid of the girls!


STAN
Yeah, come on guys, this is war!

BOYS
Yeah! That's right! Come on!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
And here we see the tender, magical
uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous
Fallopian tubes, m'kay.

[Mr. Garrison's room, later]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, now I wanna review the
different sexual positions. Who can
tell me which sexual positions we talked
about?

FILMORE
Miss'nary position?

MR. GARRISON
Missionary position, good. A little
boring, but tried and true. What else?


GIRL
Doggie?

MR. GARRISON
That's right. Doggie style we went
over, mhm.

BOY
Pile driver?

MR. GARRISON
Uh huh, pile driver position. Good,
Quaid.

SALLY
The Filthy Sanchez?

MR. GARRISON
Yes, good Flora, you remembered the
Filthy Sanchez.

BOY 2
Hot Karl?

MR. GARRISON
Yes,you can give your partner the ol'
Hot Karl, sure.

[A barren field near the school, day. An army of boys comes in
from a distance in makeshift military vehicles. Butters is wearing
a hockey mask. Clyde comes up and stops them.]

CLYDE
There, you see? The girls have built
some kind of stronghold to keep us out.


WENDY
Stay away from us, bastards! We don't
wanna get pregnant!

BEBE
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go
away forever!

STAN
Ha! They're your diseases!

KYLE
Yeah! You get out of town!

CARTMAN
Here, talk to them, Butters.

BUTTERS
Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed
to say?

CARTMAN
Just tell them that if they leave town
peacefully, we won't have to resort
to violence.

BUTTERS
Just walk away. You can put a stop
to all this. Just walk away and we will
spare your lives. Just walk away.


KYLE
Man, he's pretty good.

BEBE
We'll never walk away. Never!

KENNY
(Waa-ooo!)

CARTMAN
Oh, bitch!

STAN
That does it! Attack!

[Ms. Choksondik's house, at that moment. They have books open]


COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan
tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion
of bodily fluids, m'kay.

Ms. Choksondik	I've already gone through that with the girls.
[closes her book and sets it down] It's pretty simple. Do you
wanna drink?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can...
get through that stuff pretty quick,
mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with
another lesson plan.

Ms. Choksondik	[hands Mr. Mackey his drink] Something about how
nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. [sits down]


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.


Ms. Choksondik	Or the... shaft... of the penis? [they look away
from each other]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
It... says here that the uh, head of
the penis is actually the... most sensitive...
part, m'kay.

Ms. Choksondik	Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated
at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... [looks at
him. They draw close to each other] clitoris of the woman.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
And these... are the two areas most
important to-

Ms. Choksondik	Sexual stimulation. [they kiss quick, then kiss
full and long. Some love music comes up. She pulls back] Oh,
is this wrong?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.
I've been thinking about you a lot,
Ms. Choksondik.

Ms. Choksondik	Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?


COUNSELOR MACKEY
I go crazy.

Ms. Choksondik	Do you touch yourself?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yeah. Hmm.

Ms. Choksondik	[writhing] Haawww. Haawww.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
G'oh, m'kay.

Ms. Choksondik	Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Huh, what's wrong?

Ms. Choksondik	It's your turn. [goes down to work on him]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!


Ms. Choksondik	[gets up] Do you want me?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I do.

Ms. Choksondik	Tell me.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I want you. M'kay.

Ms. Choksondik	Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well. No.

Ms. Choksondik	[looks into his eyes and then] Oh well, fuck it
[they go down, and the consummation begins] Oh God, give it to
me! [his ass rises for the first time]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh yeah. Woh.

Ms. Choksondik	Woh. [his ass appears again] Ooh, that's it baby!
That's it!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Aw, this feels so good, m'kay.

[The empty field. later. The battle is joined. Kids run around
seeking positions from which to shoot. Seven boys come up to
the stronghold gate. A girl fires a Gatling gun at them from
the left side, and they scatter, dropping their weapons]

BOYS
WAAAAHHH!!

GIRLS
Waaaahh!!

[The Marsh house. Randy and Sharon are reading papers when the
house moves about as if an earthquake had just rolled by. Sharon
drops her paper]

SHARON
What the hell was that?

[Ms. Choksondik's house. Mr. Mackey and Ms. Choksondik rise from
their activity and look out the window]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Did you feel something?

[Chef's house. The front door opens and he walks out. He's shocked
at what he sees.]

CHEF
Oh, no!

[South Park Elementary. The four remaining staff members, Principal
Victoria, Mr Garrison, Mr. Adler, and Ms. Chosie, walk out and
see the wreckage. Principal Victoria puts her hand over her mouth
in dumbfounded shock]

MR. GARRISON
Jesus Christ.

CARTMAN
Ew, Butters? You're in big trouble now.


[The empty field. later. All the parents have come by to make
sure their kids are okay. The wreckage still burns]

SHARON
Well,I don't know what got into you
kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves.


STAN
We just didn't want the girls giving
us diseases.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm afraid this is all my fault. I...
think I went a little overboard scaring
the girls. I forgot to tell them that
to get diseases from boys you... have
to thave sex with them first.

KIDS
Oooohhh.

CHEF
Well, I hate to say it, but you all
got what you deserved.

PARENTS
Huh?

CHEF
Look: Schools are teaching condom use
to younger and younger students each
say! But sex isn't something that should
be taught in textbooks and diagrams.
Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs
to be taught by family. I know it can
be hard, parents, but if you leave it
up to the schools to teach sex to kids,
you don't know who they're learning
it from. It could be from someone who
doesn't know,  someone who has a bad
opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert.


MR. GARRISON
Wha? Why did you pan to me just now?
What the hell is that s'posed to mean?


MS. CHOKSONDIK
He's right. I never knew how special
and personal sex was un... until just
recently

SHARON
This whole mess started because we couldn't
talk to our boy ourselves.

KYLE'S MOTHER
It's easier to just leave it up to the
school, but it's...just not a school
subject.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Then it's decided: no more condom classes
in grade school.

KIDS
Hooray!

STAN
But Chef, when is the right age for
us to start having sex?

CHEF
It's very simple, children. The right
time to start having sex is...  17.


KYLE
Seventeen?

CHEF
Seventeen.

KYLE'S MOTHER
So you mean 17 as long as you're in
love?

CHEF
Nope, just 17.

KYLE'S FATHER
But, what if you're not ready at 17?


CHEF
Seventeen! You're ready.

STAN
Well, I guess we got a while to wait
before we have to worry about sex and
diseases, huh, Wendy?

WENDY
Yeah. Thank God.

CARTMAN
Well, I guess now that that's out of
the way, we can get on with our lives.
Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket,
red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red
rocket, dog. Red rocket now.

"IT HITS THE FAN"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Morning, bus stop. Stan and Kyle wait for the bus, and Kyle
arrives]

KYLE
Hey you guys! Look what I have!

STAN
What?

KYLE
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!


STAN, KENNY
...Oh.

KYLE
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed
to be really cool.

STAN
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really
cool.

CARTMAN
You goys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!!
Oh my God, you guys!!

KYLE
What, doughboy?!

CARTMAN
I was just-  I was just watching the
TV! They had this commercial.

STAN
So?

CARTMAN
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight
on that show, Cop Drama.

KYLE
What?

Cartman	No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's
never been said on television.

KYLE
What?!

CARTMAN
You'll never guess.

STAN
What?!

CARTMAN
Guess.

KYLE
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna
say on Cop Drama?

CARTMAN
You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on
TV, they're gonna say,  "Shit."

KYLE
They're gonna say "shit" on television?


STAN
They can't say "shit" on television!


CARTMAN
It was just on the news! People are
freaking out, dude.

STAN
Holy fucking shit!

KENNY
(Dude! We've gotta watch!)

CARTMAN
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to
my house to see it.

KYLE
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion
King on stage!

CARTMAN
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said
"shit!" On television!

KYLE
It's just a marketing ploy by the network.
Like that time they had the first male-to-male
kiss with Terrance and Phillip?

STAN
Aw, come, on dude! This is history.


KYLE
It's stupid!

CARTMAN
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle.
What's the matter? You got some sand
in your vagina?

KYLE
No, I don't have sand in my vagina!
I just think it's a little immature
for us to be standing around talking
about one dumb word being on TV!

[Day, South Park Center for Seismic Activity, water cooler. Randy
Marsh and three others shoot the breeze there]

RANDY
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?


SAM
Yeah, they're gonna say "shit" on television.


COLLEAGUE 1
And we should all get together and
watch it at the bar.

COLLEAGUE 2
Yeaaahhh!

SAM
Yeah.

RANDY
Yeah.

COLLEAGUE 2
Hey, are you guys gonna let your kids
watch?

RANDY
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama
is a very artsy, dramatic show.

SAM
And they're gonna say "shit."

[Day, sidewalk. Butters is tagging TELE's as Kyle walks up to
him]

KYLE
Hey! Butters!  I got tickets to go see
Lion King tonight, and I decided to
invite  YOU before anybody else.

BUTTERS
Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say
"shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and
dad say I have to watch it with them
so that I don't take it the wrong way.


KYLE
How many ways are there to take it?!
It's just a stupid word!

MR. GARRISON
Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes!


[Night, the town bar. Many of the town's men, including Randy
and his coworkers, are inside watching "Cop Drama." The officers
in the show speak in hushed tones]

COP
Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on
the line every day. How dare you accuse
me!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes...


MITCHELL
I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to
know where that evidence was shipped!


JIMBO
Oh! Was that it? Was that it?!

RANDY
Shipped. He said "shipped."

FRANK
I told you, we don't have a record of
that. And besides, -

[Cut to Cartman's house, night. Cartman sits on the sofa with
Stan, Kyle and Kenny, and he's eating from a box of Cheesy Poofs]


FRANK
- your job is to protect the men who
serve this force.

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, when are they gonna say "shit"?!


STAN
Sshhh!

MITCHELL
Maybe... maybe protect them from you?


[Cut to Chef's house, bedroom. He and Principal Victoria watch
the show together in bed]

FRANK
Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking
to!

MITCHELL
Then maybe you're forgetting how I used
to be a cop, too!

[Cut to the Broflovski house, living room. Sheila and Sharon
are enjoying some popcorn as they view the show. Sheila is in
the arnchair]

FRANK
Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, he doesn't know Mitchell slept with
his wife, does he?

[Cut to the old folks home.]

MITCHELL
That's it, I've had enough of this.


FRANK
Don't you turn your back on me, you!


[Cut to New York's Times Square, in which a large crowd watches
the show from behind a N.Y.P.D. police line]

MITCHELL
I said, enough!

[Cut back to Cartman's house.]

FRANK
Will it... ever be enough?

ANNOUNCER
Cop Drama will return after these messages.


STAN
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are
they ever gonna say "shit?"

CARTMAN
I'm sure they're just holding it till
the very last scene.

STAN, KYLE
Eugh!

STAN
Where are you going, Kyle?

KYLE
I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!


STAN
But you're gonna miss it! The, they're
gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss
it!

KYLE
I don't really give a fuck!

STAN
Oh.

[The bar, later.]

MITCHELL
Just understand that it's my job. I
still think you're a good cop.

FRANK
Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta
do what you're gonna do. Let's just
try and stay friends no matter what.


MITCHELL
You're right. Maybe I'll ss-see you
around.

FRANK
Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell?  You... got
some shit on the side of your mouth
right there.

MITCHELL
Oh, yeah, that ole thing, yeah.

BAR PATRONS
...Wwooww!!!

[Cartman's house...]

THE BOYS
Whoa!!!

[Chef's bedroom...]

CHEF
Oh!!

[The old folks home...]

OLD FOLKS
Whoa!

[Times Square... the crowd there cheers]

[The bar...]

JIMBO
They did it!

[Cartman's house...]

STAN
I can't believe they actually said it.


CARTMAN
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so
awesome!

KYLE
Well! I hope it lived up to all the
hype! You must feel sooo much better
now!

CARTMAN
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out
of your vagina. It's making you cranky.
Does it itch?

KYLE
Do you really think anything's gonna
be any different now?!  Do you really
think that this will have the tiniest,
smallest effect on the world?  It's
still the same old world out there.
Look.  What the hell?

CARTMAN
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.

KYLE
Oh, whatever.

[Channel 4 News]

ANCHOR TOM
Last night, the daring and bold show,
Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying
"SHIT" on television, making "shit"
officially okay to say around the country.
A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans
think the show has pushed the envelope
too far, while a whopping 76% say they
don't really give a shit.  In other
news, a strange virus which causes victims
to vomit up their intestines is making
life shitty for a small farming community.
Rick Watts has the story.

RICK WATTS
Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going
down here in the small tow-

TOM
Whoa, shit!

[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, in lieu of the common
usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's
position on the word, "shit."

STAN
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!


KYLE
This is ridiculous! Just because they
say it on TV it's alright.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yes, but only in the figurative noun
form or the adjective form

CARTMAN
Huh?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
You can only use it in the non-literal
sense. For instance,  "That's a shitty
picture of me." is now fine. Hoever,
the literal noun form of  "This is a
picture of shit." is still naughty.


CARTMAN
I don't get it.

STAN
Me neither.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
The adjective form is now also acceptable.
For example:  "The weather outside is
shitty." However, the literal adjective
is NOT appropriate. For example:  "My
bad diarrhea made the inside of the
toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean
it with a rag, which then also became
shitty."  That's right out!

TIMMY
Sshh...sshh... shit.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Very good, Timmy.

BUTTERS
Huh-uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we
say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh,
shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yes, that's now fine.

CARTMAN
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole
new word!

KYLE
It's NOT NEW!! I'm gonna look "shit"
up in the encyclopedia and PROVE it!!


CARTMAN
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just
got a little sand in his vagina.

KYLE
THERE'S NO SAND IN MY VAGINA!!!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Boys, watch your language! Shit!

[Kindergarten, day]

MR. GARRISON
And so, children, instead of saying
"Hand in your papers," I may now say
"Hand in your shit." Any questions?


FILMORE
What about, "I have to take a shit"?


MR. GARRISON
NO! NO, Filmore! You can say "I have
to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have
to poop," but NOT "I have to shit."
Are we all clear?

KINDERGARTNERS
No.

MR. GARRISON
Look, it's all about context. Well,
for example, recently, I have come out
and admitted that I was a homosexual.
I'm gay. That means that now I can say
the word, "fag." On television they
usually don't allow "fag." But because
I'm gay, it's alright. And with the
new approval of the word, "shit," that
means that finally I am free to say,


Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,

Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?

Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,

Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?

[pleased] Oh this is great!

[South Park, some days later. The town has taken to using the
S word, with S-themed stores and products all over the place.
Poeple proudly sport the word on their shirts. An elderly couple
walks out of Sh*t 'n Things and stop just outside the door]


ELDERLY WOMAN
Why that store has such lovely shit.


ELDERLY MAN
Yeah.  Too bad I don't have shit for
cash right now.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, looks like the weather might turn
shitty.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've
done enough shit outside today and shit.


MAN
Shit, Peter, you look like shit.

PETER
Oh, shit, I feel like shit. I think
I to-

WOMAN 1
Holy shit!

WOMAN 2
Did you see that shit?

BARBARDY
What kind of shit is this?

MAN 1
That is some weird shit.

WOMAN 3
Susan, your shit's ready!

MAN 2
Hey, do you know where this shit goes?


MAN 3
Shit if I know.

WOMAN 4
Nice going, shit-for-brains.

[a high mountain is shown]

MAN 4
Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O


MAN 5
No shit!

[seven knights are shown encased in ice. The smoke reaches them
and thaws them out. Music swells. They step forth and walk to
the edge of a cliff, looking out over all those towns and cities
spewing forth the filthy word. They draw their swords and raise
them high, and lightning strikes each of the swords]

[South Park, another day. Mr. Garrisn is walking down the street,
singing.]

MR. GARRISON
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,


Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?

Hey, there,-

MAN 6
Oh, shit, 'scuse me.

MR. GARRISON
Hey, watch it, fag.

MAN 6
What did you call me?

MR. GARRISON
I called you a fag. Because I'm gay,
and that means I'm free to use the word
"fag." So piss off, you fag-shitter!


Heh, so hay there, shity shitty fag fag

Shitty shitty fag fag, kutuputupuh [walks past Stan and Cartman.
Cartman is sucking on a Popsicle]

STAN
This suck. Now that "shit"'s out, it
isn't fun to say it anymore.

CARTMAN
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out
of "shit." We're gonna have to start
saying other bad words, like cock and
fuck and... meecrob.

STAN
What's meecrob?

CARTMAN
You know, that stuff you get as a appetizer
at Thai food restaurants. "meecrob"
is way grosser than "shit," dude. I'd
scarf down a whole wet bucket fullof
shit before I ate another plate of meecrob.


KYLE
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the
word, "shit!" I think it might have
something to do with people dying!


STAN
What?

KYLE
Haven't you noticed everyone getting
sick? It all started when they said
"shit" on television.

CARTMAN
Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.


KYLE
I am not full of meekro- what? Look,
the word "shit" first showed up in English
in the 1340s, the same time as something
called, "the Black Death."

STAN
What's that?

CARTMAN
Kyle, do you still have sand in your
vagina about us not going to The Lion
King with you?! I mean, shit, dude,
let it go.

KYLE
Look! It might be a coincidence, but
I think we'd better ask someone. Come
on!

[Hollywood, day, the HBC building, home of "Terrance and Phillip."
The network president talks to his staff in a boardroom. They're
all smiles]

HBC PRESIDENT
...Seventy-five share. My God, I never
thought it was possible.

DIRECTOR 1
Sir, your "shit" idea has turned the
entire network around. We're proud to
work for you.

DIRECTOR 2
Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity:
I'm sure I speak for all of us when
I say, you are the most creative genius
in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let
you have me if you wanted.

HBC PRESIDENT
Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started.
You see, I've already figured out our
new marketing scheme technique for the
next run of shows.

DIRECTOR 3
Whoa!

DIRECTOR 4
Wow, he's unstoppable!

DIRECTOR 1
What's the new idea?

DIRECTOR 3
I can hardly wait.

DIRECTOR 5
I'm about to piss myself!

HBC PRESIDENT
This Saturday... on HBC... we're going
to say...  "shit" ...twice.

DIRECTOR 3
...Twice!

DIRECTOR 4
Brilliant!

DIRECTOR 6
Think of the repetition!

DIRECTOR 3
It's like saying it once... but double!


HBC PRESIDENT
Well gentlemen, let's get on it!

ALL
Ho!

[South Park Elementary, day. Chef is singing away in the kitchen,
serving up lunch for the kids.]

CHEF
Baby you are so fine, and shit!

The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any
day!

[the boys walk in] Oh, hello there, children.

THE BOYS
Hey Chef.

KYLE
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes
from?

CHEF
Uh, from your ass, children.

KYLE
No no no! The word, "shit."

CHEF
Oooh.

CARTMAN
Detective Sandy Vagina here thinks
that "shit" might have something to
do with everyone getting sick

KYLE
Ungh, it said in my book that the word,
"shit," started the exact same time
as something called, "The Black Death."


CHEF
The Black Death? Are you sure?

STAN
What's the Black Death, Chef?

CHEF
LaToya Jackson, children.

THE BOYS
Oh.

CHEF
But I think back in those days it meant
something else: the plague!

[The Library, later. Chef reads from a large book on a large
table on the ground floor. To his left sit Stan and Kenny, to
his right Kyle and Cartman]

CHEF
It says here the word, "shit" has been
around for over 600 years. It comes
from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite."


KYLE
Right. But in the 1340s people in England
stopped calling it "skite" and started
calling it "shit." The same year as
the Black Plague.

LIBRARIAN
This is the oldest book in the library.
A priceless original of England's history.
Just about everythign you could want
to know about the plague is in this
great tome.  Oh, shit. Well, this other
book has some good information, too.


CHEF
The Black Plague. Over half of Europe
was killed by it.

STAN
Look, they're puking out their intestines,
just like the people here.

CHEF
Look at this, children.  It says that
the people in England believed that
the plague was a curse, a dark magic
infliction brought on by a mass utterance
of a word of curse.

STAN
Word of curse?

KYLE
A c...curse word.

CHEF
Of course! I've never even thought about
why we use the term "curse word" before.


STAN
Because it brings a curse? Like the
Black Death.

CARTMAN
You guys, look here.  In this Nancy
Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach
and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This...
could explain how Kyle got it in his
vagina.

KYLE
Cartman, this is serious!!!

CARTMAN
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your
vagina doesn't get released, you could
become a walking time bomb.

LIBRARIAN
If you don't mind, I'll have to close
up now. They're going to say "shit"
seven times on HBC and I d-agh!

STAN
Holy shit!

CARTMAN
Oho, gross!

KYLE
Dude, this plague is spreading like
wildfire!

STAN
Uh oh.

KENNY
(Uh oh.)

CARTMAN
Kenny's got it. heh heh.

KYLE
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we
don't we don't stop that network,  "shit"
will becvome an even more acceptable
word!

CHEF
Children, we've got to warn those producers
in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit,"
could be linked!

[An airplane, day. Chef and the boys are headed for Hollywood]


CAPTAIN
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is
your captain speaking. If you look out
the right side of the aircraft you can
see some interesting shit.  And over
on the left side, there's some interesting
shit, too.  Well, we should be arriving
in los Angeles in about two hours. Until
then we invite you to sit back, relax,
and enjoy our shitty service.

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, Kenny! Don't get your plague
germs on me!

KYLE
Cartman, stop being an asshole!

[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, boardroom.]

DIRECTOR 5
Tha ratings are in, sir. We broke another
record last night with the show that
said "shit" seven times!

DIRECTOR 1
Where is the roof on this thing? I mean,
I mean, how can we top ourselves now?


HBC PRESIDENT
Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest
marketing ploy of all time.  Tonight,
on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms...
LIVE. And have everyone say "shit" in
place of their written lines. And we'll
call it "Must Shit TV."

DIRECTOR 1
Bravo!

DIRECTOR 2
"Night Of A Million Shits!"

HBC PRESIDENT
Now, doing this live will be difficult,
so we must-

CHEF
Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!

HBC PRESIDENT
Who are you?

CHEF
My name is Chef, and these are the children!
We've come to warn you about "shit."


HBC PRESIDENT
Oh brother, another Christian protest
group

DIRECTOR 1
Who wants to take this one?

DIRECTOR 2
I'll get it.  Gentlemen, we appreciate
your concern.  Here at HBC the general
goal is providing the highest and most
thought-provoking netertainment. How
great it is that we live in a country
where an artist can express himself
freely. That's not only the American
spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows
us to make great family programs like
Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's
favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank
you enough for bringing your concerns
to our network, for it is you, the loyal
HBC viewer, who makes this great network,
and indeed, the great country that it
is.

HBC PRESIDENT
Alright, now, as I was saying-

CHEF
Hey! Hold on a minute!

HBC PRESIDENT
Aw, are they stil here?

CHEF
Haven't you people noticed all the strange
things going on?

KYLE
We think that you might have could it
by helping make "shit" an everyday word.


DIRECTOR 4
Mhm, right, right.

KYLE
It's true. We think that word might
be plaguing our friend, Kenny.

HBC PRESIDENT
Do you have any proof of this?

KYLE
...Nnno

HBC PRESIDENT
Then  get out of here before we have
you thrown out!

CARTMAN
But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle
dolls, right?

[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, outside. Chef and the boys
exit the building.]

CHEF
Damn cracker-ass producers!

STAN
Now what are we gonna do, Chef?

CHEF
I don't know, children. I guess we've
got to get the word out to people some
other way.

LEAD KNIGHT
Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.

STAN
Oh shit!

LEAD KNIGHT
Stand aside!

[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, boardroom.]

HBC PRESIDENT
Alright, now, we have to get all our
biggest names to say "shit," and then
we're gonna-

LEAD KNIGHT
Halt your evil plans!

EXECUTIVES
Huh?

LEAD KNIGHT
I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing!
Who is in charge here?

HBC PRESIDENT
Oh...  nno, you guys didn't hire me
a stripper for my birthday-oooh, tell
me you guys didn't.

LEAD KNIGHT
Show your true form, Geldon, lest you
be afraid! Your short time in this world
is at an end!  Awch. The Rune Stone
has no effect! You are not Geldon!


HBC PRESIDENT
I never said I was.

LEAD KNIGHT
You will die anyway, for you have spread
the word of curse!

HBC PRESIDENT
Security!

LEAD KNIGHT
Waaarrgh!

[HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, outside. Chef and the boys
approach the fallen knight.]

CHEF
Who are you?

LEAD KNIGHT
Take this.

STAN
What are we supposed to do with it?


LEAD KNIGHT
Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

KYLE
Now what?

CHEF
We've got to find people who would know
what the hell this is all about. Children,
we're goin'ta have to go to the land
of castles, knights, and kings!

[Las Vegas, sunset, a view of the Strip, showing many of the
attractions that can be found there.]

ANNOUNCER
Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome
to the grandest casino in the land,
Excalibur!

BARKER
Take a free spin. Double your odds.


CHEF
'Scuse me. Do you work here?

BARKER
How can I help you, noble sir?

KYLE
We need some help identifying an ancient
English stone.

BARKER
A what?

STAN
It might hold the key to a curse.

BARKER
Uh... I can help get you some credit
or a comp meal, perhaps.

STAN
Dude, we need help from the British!


BARKER
Lluhook kid, Thihis is just a casino.
I can't help you. You know, not every
British person knows about wizards
and dragons and curses.

CHEF
We just need help identifying this.


BARKER
The Rune Stome of Gaelic! Where did
you get this?

STAN
You know what it is?

BARKER
The Skyre once spoke of such a stone!
Come, we must see the sorcerer!

[South Park, bar, night. The men are gathered there once again]


ANNOUNCER
Get ready for "Must Shit TV!" Starting
now, four straight hours of pure shit!
It's all live!

[On the set of the Drew Carey show. Drew and Mimi are onstage,
with Drew sitting at his desk]

DREW
Hey! Hm, heh, shit! Heh.  Ya ain't shit.


MIMI
Hyeh. Dude, ya ain't shit!

HBC PRESIDENT
This is it. My greatest work.

[Excalibur, inside. The barker leads Chef and the boys down a
hall and run into a waitress dressed as a damsel]

WAITRESS
Cocktails. Cocktails.

BARKER
There Americans wish to see the Skyre!


WAITRESS
Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!


[Excalibur, the hallway to the Inner Sanctum. The barker and
waitress lead Chef and the boys through]

BARKER
How could you foolish Americans bring
the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting
the word of wretchedness?!

CHEF
Aah, yeah. We didn't mean to.

BARKER
Didn't you realize "shit" is a curse
word?!

STAN
Well, yeah, but I don't think that "curse
word" meant... curse word.

BARKER
Ha! Leave it to American to think that
"no" means yes, "pissed" means angry,
and "curse word" means something other
than a word that's cursed!!

[The Inner Sanctum. The group enters and walks towards the sorcerer]


SORCERER
Let me see the stone.

CHEF
But I don't get it. People use curse
words all the time.

BARKER
Saying a word of curse once in a while
does nothing. It's only when spoken
repeatedly and en masse that the curse
takes place.

SORCERER
Uhuh-I've seen this before. Stones
that were used by the Knights of Standards
and Practices.

CHEF
Knights of Standards and Practices?


SORCERER
A legion of men sworn to do whatever
necessary to keep the words at bay.
But... they were just a myth.

[South Park, bar, night. The men watch the Drew Carey Show]


MIMI
You know what? You're dumb as shit!


DREW
Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give
a shit!

RANDY
Ng-aah, that word's kind of getting
old. It's not really... funny anymore.


MAN 7
Yeah, they're gonna have to come up
with a new swear word now.

MR. GARRISON
Well, they can't use "fag." Because
you can't say "fag" unless you're a
homosexual.

RANDY
Really? So we can't say __g?

MR. GARRISON
No. See, you got beeped.

MAN 7
You mean you have to be a __g to say
__g?

MR. GARRISON
That's right.

JIMBO
Hell, that's not fair! I should be able
to say "fag."

RANDY
...Hey, you didn't get beeped.

JIMBO
Uh oh.

MR. GARRISON
Well well well! Guess we learned something
new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag!
You wanna make out or something?

DREW
Aw, man, I am up shit creek.

[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The door to stage C opens
and in gallop the knights with swords drawn]

MIMI
Serves you right, shit-for-brains!


DREW
Yeah, how could I be such a dumb...sh-


LEAD KNIGHT
Say not the word of curse!

HBC PRESIDENT
What the?

MIMI
Holy shit!

[South Park, bar, night. The men watch the Drew Carey Show]


MR. GARRISON
Oh boy, this show is really reaching
for plot now!

[Excalibur, the Inner Sanctum. The Sorcerer continues with the
mythology of the knights]

SORCERER
The knights were formed to keep curse
words to a minimum. Should a curse word
ever be let out, they would return.
A rune for each word of curse was made,
representing each of the eight words
that so offended God...

STAN
Look, there's the F-word.

KYLE
And asshole.

CARTMAN
I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse
word! God must hate it as much as I
do!

SORCERER
Look at this: The writing here claims
this stone can defeat the evil geldon
, who will rise when the word of curse
has been said enough times to give him
power. Then all the world will be destroyed.


STAN
All the world destroyed?

CARTMAN
My house, too?

CHEF
Oh no!

SORCERER
What?

CHEF
Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits"
on HBC! It's gonna be said over and
over!

SORCERER
Then we haven't much time. We must go!


[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The blond knight approaches
the cameraman]

BLOND KNIGHT
Turn off those devices of broadcast!


HBC PRESIDENT
What is coing on here?! Stop this shit!


BLOND KNIGHT
We are the Royal Order of Standards
and Practices!

BLAD KNIGHT
We command you to stop saying the curse
word!

HBC PRESIDENT
Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head
of this network, and I will say "shit"
all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit,
shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit
shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit
shit shit shit, , shit shit shit shit
shit shit shit shit shit shit!

Oh, shit!

[South Park, bar, night. The TV screen is show, with the HBC
logo]

ANNOUNCER
And now, back to Must Shit TV, here
on HBC.

[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues - the
knights fight the geldon valiantly]

LEAD KNIGHT
He is too strong! We cannot fight him
without the rune stone!

DIRECTOR 1
My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed
upon the world?!

HBC PRESIDENT
I didn't know.  I DIDN'T KNOW!!!

[South Park, bar, night. The men watch in increasing disbelief]


RANDY
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline
at all.

[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues, but
Chef and the boys arrive]

KYLE
Wait!

CARTMAN
Oh boy, that thing has really got sand
in its vagina!

LEAD KNIGHT
The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon!


GELDON
Agh. Dude, lame. Lame!  Sorry, dudes.


CARTMAN
What a stupid voice.

KYLE
It's okay. The curse has been lifted.


STAN
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't
come back.

KYLE
You see, we've learned something today.
Swearing can be fun, but doing it all
the time causes a lot of problems.


[Cut to Kyle's home, where he's on TV]

KYLE
We're all saying the S-word too much!


IKE
Kyle.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television!


KYLE'S FATHER
Uh huh.

[Cut to the old folks' home]

KYLE
The knights of Standards and Practices
were created to make sure that bad words
were kept to a minimum. "Curse words"
They're called that because they are
a curse. We have to go back to only
using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.


STAN
And besides, too much use of a dirty
word takes away from its... impact.
We believe in free speech and all that,
but... keeping a few words taboo just
adds to the fun of English.

CARTMAN
So please, everyone, From now on you've
got to try and watch your language.


[South Park, bar, night. The men think over the boys' message]


THE MEN
Yeah.

RANDY
That makes sense.

COLLEAGUE 1
Ain't that right?

MR. GARRISON
Is this still part of the show?

[On the set of the Drew Carey show. The place is calm now]

HBC PRESIDENT
We're sorry, noble knights of Standards
and Pracrices,  from now on, we will
obey your laws.

BLOND KNIGHT
See that you do!

CHEF
I'm very proud of you, children. Let's
all go home and find a nice white woman
to make love to.

STAN
Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!

KENNY
(Yeah, I didn't- Goddamnit! Aargh!)


STAN
Holy shi-  poo.

CARTMAN
Hah, I love you guys.

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 414


"GREAT EXPECTATIONS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[The camera pans across a nicely appointed study, rests a bit,
and "SOUTH PARK classics" appears on screen as a classical piece
plays]

A BRITISH PERSON
Aaah.  Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone
streets, cragging London buildings,
and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings.
Hello, I'm a British person. For years
now, the character Pip has been featured
prominently in the American show, South
Park. However, many Americans don't
realize where Pip came from. He's the
prowling little adorable Englishman
from Charles Dickens' timeless classic,
"Great Expectations"  And so tonight,
the makers of South Park have agreed
to take a break from their regular show,
and instead present the prestigious
Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning
to end. Indeed, after watching this
show, you'll know the timeless classic
as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves.
Our story is set in England, in the
small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot,
where a young blond-haired boy named
Pip was on his way to see his parents.


[Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, day. Pip leaves the town, crosses
an open field, enters an enclosed lot and stops right in front
of the camera]

PIP
'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly
is nice to see you again.  Don't worry.
Sister is still taking very good care
of me. She just loves to smack me in
the face and tell me I'm worthless.
O, we have such fun together.  But it's
getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see
you again soon.  Wa-a-ah!

EX-CONVICT
Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little
whippersham!

PIP
Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped
convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of
prison?  Oh dear! But you're shackled.
Here, let me help you.

EX-CONVICT
Wha' are you doin' wit' those?

PIP
I'm an apprentice blacksmith.  There
you are.  And here's a sandwich. You
must be starving!

EX-CONVICT
Here. W-why are you easy to help me?


PIP
Well, it's not for me to judge you,
sir. We are all the same.  Don't quite
outmart this thing, I'm afraid.

MRS. JOE
Pip, where 'ave you been?!

PIP
Waaah!  Lovely day, isn't it?

MRS. JOE
What the hell's lovely about it?!  Joe,
teach this boy some bloody cynicsim!


JOE
I don't know about that. I just thought
I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look!
I've made me a metal fire poker.


MRS. JOE
A lot of bloody good a fire poker's
gonna do while I'm starvin' to death!
Why don't you make us some bloody food
to eat!

JOE
Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal
orange.

MRS. JOE
STOP your metal orange, you bastard!
You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale
droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy!
And you! Why don't you ge' a job?!
You're eight years old now!

JOE
Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made
a metal newspaper!

MRS. JOE
Shut up, you silly lip! What are we
supposed to do with a metal newspaper?


JOE
Well, for starters we can look in the
want ads and see if we can find Pip
a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man
wanted for paid position!

MRS. JOE
Where?

PIP
Where?

MRS. JOE
"Havesham residence seeks young boy
to play with lonely daughter. Will pay
up to..." TWENTY QUID A DAY??

PIP
That's a lot of  money-loney.

JOE
You can keep a little girl company for
20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havesham
is the wealthiest woman in the town.


[The Havesham Residence is shown from the gates, next day.]


[The South Park Classics study. The British is seated in an armchair
reading a book]

A BRITISH PERSON
Well, the very next day, Pip went to
Old Ms. Havesham's house to inquire
about the job.  and it was there that
he met the girl of his dreams.

[A girl approached the gate at the Havesham Residence. She's
got flowing blonde hair and a bowler for a hat]

GIRL
Who are you?!

PIP
...I've come to answer the want ad.

GIRL
Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!


PIP
What??

GIRL
This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal
discharge!  This way, you beef-witted
shriveled-up monkey's penis.  Up here,
you gamy mass of baby vomit!  In here.


PIP
Eho. After you, miss.

GIRL
I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle
of a homeless man urine!

[The Havesham Estate, upstairs. Pip enters a grand dining room
in which everything is covered, and has been for a long time.
He scans the room until a voice gets his attention.]

MS. HAVESHAM
Who is that?

PIP
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.


MS. HAVESHAM
Come closer. Look at me.  Does it frighten
you to look upon a woman who has not
seen the sun in over 20 years?

PIP
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon
one when you have not seen the sun for
over 20 years quite a lot these... days.


MS. HAVESHAM
I sometimes have sick fancies.  And
I have a fancy I should like to see
someone play. So, play. Play.

PIP
Um.

MS. HAVESHAM
Estella, play with this boy.

ESTELLA
With HIM?  But he's just a commoner!


MS. HAVESHAM
But, you can break his heart.

ESTELLA
...Alright, boy, let us play.

PIP
Righty-o. What are we going to play?


ESTELLA
We're going to play a little game called,
"Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With
a Large Log."

PIP
Oh, yes! My sister and I play that
game at home all the time!  Who will
go first?

ESTELLA
Oh, you stupid pathetic boy!

MS. HAVESHAM
What do you think of her?

PIP
Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.


MS. HAVESHAM
Hm-m-m. What else?

PIP
I think she's rather insulting.

MS. HAVESHAM
Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you?
Come back again next week. We shall
"play" some more.

[The blacksmith's house, night. Pip returns to his sister's place
and gets ready to bed for the night. He falls asleep]

A BRITISH PERSON
That night, Pip spent all his sleeping
hours unable to get Estella's beautiful
face out of his mind.

DREAM ESTELLA
Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted
rectal belch!

A BRITISH PERSON
Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes
they would play, sometimes they would
talk. But every single day Pip's love
for Estella grew.

[The Havesham Estate, garden, day. Estella is whacking Pip over
the head with her log. Twice she does it, then tries a third
time, but can't]

PIP
Don't you wanna play anymore?

ESTELLA
Boy, do you still think I'm pretty?


PIP
Oho. Well, yes, miss.

ESTELLA
And, do you still think I'm insulting?


PIP
Oh, um, not so much as before.  Ow!


ESTELLA
I hate you! You're an oozing, painful
hemorrhoid that belches pus!

PIP
Oh, dear.

ESTELLA
You may kiss me if you like.  Come.
Let us walk in the daisy garden.


A BOY
Oh, what fun it is to splash about in
the fountain!  You there, the prowling
little boy! I bet you can't jump on
my back!  Go on, then. Try and jump
on my back!

PIP
Who is that?

ESTELLA
Just another playmate hired to amuse
me. You didn't think you were the only
one, did you?

PIP
Oh I... rather thought I was.

ESTELLA
Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come,
let us walk through the rose garden.


[The Havesham Estate, exterior. The camera looks at the second
floor, focusing on Ms. Havesham]

MS. HAVESHAM
Yes, good. She will break his pathetic
heart into a million pieces.

[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]


A BRITISH PERSON
Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He
was hired to be the friend of the very
harsh and beautiful Estella. And although
she treated him like dirt, or perhaps
because she treated him like dirt, Pip
found himself more in love with the
little girl each and every day.  Oh,
bless him! Isn't he lovely??  But, isn't
it sad? Because Pip knew that someone
as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella
could never love him, for he was just
a simple blacksmith's apprentice.


[The blacksmith's house, night. Joe is working on another creation.
Pip watches]

JOE
And so you bang on this side, and bang
on that side, and there you have it.
Your very own metal fuzzy dice.

PIP
Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely.

JOE
Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?

PIP
Joe, do you know anything about girls?


JOE
Sure! They're those things with vaginas
in them.

PIP
But, do you anything about them? About
how they work.

JOE
Oh, I don't know about that. I just
like to keep to me blacksmithin'.


PIP
Do you think that a girl who is rich
and educated would ever want to be with
a blacksmith?

JOE
Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.
Who could that be?

LAWYER
Joe, the blacksmith?

JOE
The same.

LAWYER
I'm a lawyer from London in search of
a young lad named Pip.

PIP
I'm Pip, sir.

LAWYER
Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here
to offer you a reasonable sum of money
in exchange for your apprentice.


JOE
Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.


LAWYER
I have a client who wishes to give this
bright child a future. Anything he desires.
Do you still object?

JOE
Heaven forbid I should stand in the
way of Pip's future, but-

LAWYER
He will one day inherit a handsome property.
But the owner of that property wants
him first to travel to London and learn
to be a gentleman.

JOE
That's great news!

LAWYER
There's only one condition, Pip. Your
benefactor wishes to remain anonymous


PIP
Oho. But it must be Ms. Havesham!

LAWYER
OH OH! If you have any suspicion of
who that person might be, you are to
keep it in your own breast. Understood?


PIP
Yes sir.

LAWYER
Then you will go to London in a week's
time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith,
you look stunned.

JOE
I am, sir.

LAWYER
Then I should take my leave.  Good evening,
gentlemen, and we shall see you in London
next week, Pip.

PIP
Good-bye, sir.

JOE
Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations!


[London, a foggy night. Big Ben peals in the background. The
camera pans down from the skyline to a horse-drawn carriage,
which comes to a stop. Pip and the lawyer get out]

LAWYER
You shall stay here with your roommate,
Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young
lad who will help you on your way to
being a gentleman. I trust you see no
problem with this?

PIP
None, sir.

LAWYER
I should think not.  On up, then, and
prepare for school on the morrow.


PIP
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

[The Dormitory. Pip walks down the hall and finds a door with
his name under that of Mr. Pocket. He is about to knock when
a boy opens the door]

A BOY
Mr. Pip?

PIP
Mr. Pocket?

POCKET
Pray, come in!

PIP
Thank you kindly. You do look rather
familiar

POCKET
As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other
before. As to our lodging, it's not
by any means splendid. This is our sitting
room - just chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth.  This is my little room
- rather musty, and this is your bedroom.


PIP
My, how lovely.

POCKET
Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and
I do mean gay as in festive, not as
in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear
me! I beg your pardon! You're holding
your bags all this time! Pray, let me
take them!  I'm quite ashamed!

PIP
Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless
me! Why, you're the pale young man I
saw at Ms. Havesham's house!

POCKET
Why, yes of course! You're the prowling
little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!


PIP
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havesham
is very generous indeed.

POCKET
That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I
have nothing to do with her anymore.
She's absolutely mad!

PIP
Well, what do you mean?

POCKET
Well, don't you know about Ms. Havesham's
melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite
a story, and should be discussed over
dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing
meal and the story of Ms. Havesham.


PIP
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am
desperately trying to become a gentleman!
For the love of a certain girl. So,
will you please tell me if I do something
wrong at the table?

POCKET
You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine.
Now on to Ms. Havesham: She was raised
by a wealthy father and grew up to be
a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now
I might mention, Pip, that in London
it is not the custom to put the knife
in the mouth.

PIP
Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!

POCKET
Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms.
Havesham grew up to be a lovely young
lady, and soon a man came along, which
gets me to the cruel part of the story,
merely breaking off, Pip , to remark
that a dinner napkin should never be
placed into the tumbler.

PIP
Sorry! Sorry!

POCKET
Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man
pursued Ms. Havesham closely and professed
to be devoted to her. She passionately
loved him back. The marriage day was
fixed, the wedding dress was bought,
the wedding guests were all invited,
and finally the day came. But not the
groom.  And I break from the tale now
only to mention that one should never
pass gas at the dinner table!

PIP
Oh. Excuse me.

POCKET
Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never
showed. He simply wrote a letter, a
letter that Ms. Havesham received 20
minutes before the wedding.

PIP
At half nine, the time when she stopped
all the clocks in the house.

POCKET
But afterward she laid waste to the
entire house, as you have seen it, and
has never since looked upon the light
of day. And the story ends, Pip, with
me suggesting that one should never
pull out the wee wee and check it for
scabs whilst at the table.

PIP
Terribly sorry, Pocket,

POCKET
Not at all, I'm sure!

[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]


A BRITISH PERSON
And so Pip spent the next several months
learning how to be a gentleman. He was
schooled in several languages. He was
taught fencing and marksmanship, and
he was shown how to dance and eat box.
And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks
of intense schooling, Pip was finally
a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself,
Pip decided to pay Ms. Havesham a visit,
to thank her for her generosity, and
to see if he was indeed, now, good enough
for Estella.

[The Havesham Estate, exterior, then interior, at the dining
room.]

PIP
Good evening, Ms. Havesham.

MS. HAVESHAM
Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite
the gentleman now, aren't you?

PIP
Thanks to you.

MS. HAVESHAM
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school
as well.  She's become quite the lady.
Would you like to see a picture of her?


PIP
Oh, my! She is even prettier than before.


MS. HAVESHAM
Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?


PIP
I don't know. I mean, I think about
her every day.

MS. HAVESHAM
Do you know what love is, Pip? It is
blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation,
utter submission, trust and belief against
yourself and against the whole world,
giving up your whole heart and soul
to snip it.

PIP
Righto.

MS. HAVESHAM
Love her, Pip. I developed her into
what she is so that she might... be loved.


PIP
Yes, but... where will I find her?

MS. HAVESHAM
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow
night. Estella will be there. Go and
seek her out. And love her. Love her!


PIP
Thank you, Ms. Havesham! For everything!
I'm the happiest boy in the land!


MS. HAVESHAM
And if she warms to you, love her; she
tears your heart into pieces. And as
you get older it will tear deeper.
Lover her.

[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]


A BRITISH PERSON
Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way.
From the apprentice of a blacksmith
to a fine young gentleman of great expectations.
And now he was to finally see his beloved
Estella again at a Grand Ball held by
the King of England, Tony Blair. It
was here that Pip would finally and
formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend.
And all would be right with the world.


[The Grand Ballroom at the Palace, evening. Tony Blair and wife
descend the Grand Staircase as dozens of couples dance before
them. The camera then pans across the scene and stops on Estella.
Pip comes in from the side]

PIP
Hello, Estella.

ESTELLA
Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed!


PIP
Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?


ESTELLA
I suppose.  So how is it that you've
learned to dress and dance?

PIP
Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.


ESTELLA
Iiii see, and you no longer live with
the blacksmith?

PIP
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I
don't have much in common with him anymore,
now that I'm a gentleman and all.


ESTELLA
Naturally.

PIP
It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.


ESTELLA
Is it? Why?

PIP
Because I believe I'm in love with you.


ESTELLA
Pip, you must know that I have no heart.


PIP
I think you do.

ESTELLA
Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed
in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat
I should cease to be, but  you know
what I mean. I have no softness there,
no sympathy, sentiment.

PIP
I see past that, Estella. I see a little
girl who wants to be warm and kind.


OLDER BOY
Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.


ESTELLA
Alright, Steve. Just one moment.

PIP
Who...? Who is that?

ESTELLA
That is Steve. He is seventeen and has
a car.

PIP
I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?


ESTELLA
I should. He's my boyfriend.

PIP
Boyfriend??

ESTELLA
What's the matter, Pip?!

PIP
I don't understand! I did everything
right! I stopped being a poor commoner!
I even blew off my lovin' Joe!

ESTELLA
It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes,
Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car.
I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving.

[The Havesham Estate, outside, a stormy night. Pip reaches the
Havesham estate and enters the front gates. He heads into the
house, up the spiral staircase, and into the dining room.]


PIP
Ms. Havesham! You have to talk to Estella!
She's going out with a-

MS. HAVESHAM
Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip.


PIP
Ms. Havesham! But um...

MS. HAVESHAM
Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip?
Look at the way he holds her hand.


PIP
But I don't understand.  You sent me
away to become a gentleman so that I
could be with Estalla.

MS. HAVESHAM
Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.
Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break
your heart?

PIP
...Well, I suppose that if you set out
to break my heart, you did a very good
job of it. Because it certainly does
hurt.

MS. HAVESHAM
Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me
about the crushing and the prickly things.


PIP
It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold
of my heart and isss  squeezing it very
tightly.

MS. HAVESHAM
Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to
breathe.

STEVE
Hey, wait a second. You mean that this
whole thing was just a setup by your
mom?

MS. HAVESHAM
Is your heart broken as well? Tell
me all about it.

PIP
But why do you make your daughter hurt
people?

MS. HAVESHAM
Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because
I need the tears of broken-hearted men
to use in my Genesis device.  You see,
my foolish child, I'm growing very old.
But tonight I will fuse my soul into
Estella's once and for all. And then
I can go on breaking men's hearts for
another generation.

STEVE
What the hell??

MS. HAVESHAM
Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis
platform.

STEVE
Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And
I'm not lettin' you walk out on me!
What the?!

MS. HAVESHAM
And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys
should take care of you!

[The blacksmith's house, day. A shadow appears at Pip's door
and falls on him. He awakens and looks at the source of the shadow]


JOE
Pip? Pip, old chap?

PIP
Joe?

JOE
That's right. You're safe and warm now.


POCKET
Joe found you lying face down in the
street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a
state. You've been unconscious here
for nearly three hours.

PIP
Ms Havesham! She has all the men who
have had their hearts broken by Estella
trapped in her house!  Oh, why would
she have wasted all that time sending
me to school and making me into a gentleman?


JOE
Well, about that, Pip: There's another
person who wants to see you.

EX-CONVICT
Allo, Pip. You remember me?

EX-CONVICT
I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em
up your arse!

PIP
Why, you're the escaped convict I helped
a long time ago.

EX-CONVICT
Yes. After you helped me I moved to
Wales and made somethin' o' myself.
If it weren't for you, I'd have never
become a millionaire.

JOE
'E's the one that sent you to London,
Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to
be a gentleman!

PIP
You? But why?

EX-CONVICT
Because back then you treated me like
any other person. You're weren't a snob
and you helped me as you would a rich
man.

PIP
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it
was Ms. Havesham. She totally let me
believe it.

POCKET
I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful,
spiteful woman.who wanted nothing more
than to see you hurt along with the
rest of the male sex.

PIP
Well, I've certainly learned a lot.
That being a gentleman doesn't mean
learning to dance, or proper table manners.
It means being a gentle man. Gentle
to everyone.

POCKET
Righto. Pip. Righto.

PIP
And now I suppose there's only one thing
left to do.

JOE
What's that, Pip.

PIP
If Ms. Havesham is determined to do
this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!


JOE
Yeah!

[The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating]


A BRITISH PERSON
And now we come to the final act of
the Dickens classic tale, inwhich the
stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms.
Havesham's robot monkeys prove a formidable
foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's
soul be forever consumed by the Genesis
device. And now the thrilling conclusion
of Great Expectations!

[The Havesham Estate, outside, a stormy night. In the dining
room Ms. Havesham prepares Estella for the Genesis device]


MS. HAVESHAM
Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready
to complete the cycle?

ESTELLA
Yes, Mother.

PIP
Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.


ESTELLA
Pip?

JOE
Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havesham!


MS. HAVESHAM
Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge
on the male race is only about to begin.


POCKET
Dear God, Pip, look!

STEVE
Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!


BOY
So am I.

MAN
And me.

MAN IN MIDDLE
We were all Estella's boyfriends at
one time or another. Now we're doomed.


MS. HAVESHAM
Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears
have collected into the Genesis device,
the fusion of Estella and me will be
complete.

PIP
You won't get away with this!

MS. HAVESHAM
Won't I?  Let the transformation begin.


JOE
Pip, she started the device!

PIP
Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever
it takes to keep those blokes from crying!


POCKET
Righto, Pip.

MS. HAVESHAM
It begins.

PIP
Come, Estella! You can't want to be
part of this.

ESTELLA
It is... what I was raised for.

ROBOT MONEKY
AAAAAAA!!!

POCKET
Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do,
please do not cry. Havesham's device
fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.


MAN
How are we not to cry. Our hearts have
been broken, our lives ruined, and now
we are set to die!

POCKET
Yes, but just thnk about... panda bears!
Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda
bears are.  What silly little noses
they have!

MAN
Panda bears make me sad. They're almost
extinct.

POCKET
Oh, right, right, let's not think about
panda bears, then. Let's think about
...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming
is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath
dive.

MS. HAVESHAM
...Yes...

EX-CONVICT
Get out of that chair, you old cow!


PIP
Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful
girl, with a kind heart.

ESTELLA
I told you, Pip. I have no heart

PIP
But you do! And I shall prove it to
you once and for all!  Look at this
adorable little bunny.

ESTELLA
Oh my. 'E's very cute.

PIP
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't
care at all about this bunny. They'd
just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But
look at this bunny.  There. You see
that? You have too big a heart to kill
two baby bunnies.  ...Right.

POCKET
Oh what fun it is to collect stamps!
Lick the backs, put them into books
all neat and tidy with those smashing
little pictures and bright colors.


MAN
My father died in a stamp-collecting
accident.

POCKET
Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting,
then. Let's talk about...

MAN IN MIDDLE
Ice-skating!

POCKET
Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can
catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating
king? That's me.

JOE
Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!

PIP
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with
a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies.
So you do have too big a heart to-
Ten baby bunnies!

JOE
...There's too many of them!

POCKET
Please, sirs, you must not cry!

MAN
We can't help it! You're bawlin' us
to tears!

POCKET
Philip, it's too late!!

PIP
Twenty-six baby bunnies

ESTELLA
I don't want to. I don't see the point
in this.

PIP
What?

ESTELLA
I don't want to kill any more of them.


PIP
There! You see?! You do have a heart!


ESTELLA
You think so? Let me see it  Maybe I
can kill it.

PIP
No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart!
You've bought your own life! Come with
me now!

MS. HAVESHAM
Yessss!  Noooo!

POCKET
Ooooo, top smart, Pip!

JOE
You did it, Pip!

[The Havesham Estate, outside, a stormy night. Joe, Pip, Pocket,
the nine males, and Estella leave the house as flames spread
from the dining room to other rooms and onto the yard. The party
moves towards the gate, then turns back to watch the burning
house]

JOE
Well, I guess Old Ms. Havesham won't
be takin' any revenge on any more blokes,
ey?

ESTELLA
Yes. her poor miserable life is finally
over.

PIP
You're released from her now, Estella!
Now we can begin our life together!


ESTELLA
Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!


POCKET
Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked
out.  Where are all my little bunnies
that you borrowed then, Pip?

[The South Park Classics study. The British Person finishes narrating]


A BRITISH PERSON
And they all lived happily ever after.
Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis
B.  So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectaton.We
hope you now have a deeper appreciation
for Pip, and indeed,  all masterpieces
of literature like this one.  Until
next time, I'm a British person. Good
night.

Episode 407


"CHEF GOES NANNERS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[The Mayor's office, day. The mayor is at her desk, flanked by
her assistants. Before her are Chef and Jimbo. The meeting starts]


MAYOR
Gentlemen, I understand you are here
to present both sides of an issue. I
wanna hear you both out and do this
in a civil and constructive manner so
that I can give you both the time and
attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't
you begin?

JIMBO
Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.


MAYOR
Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!


JIMBO
We cannot change the South Park flag,
Mayor!

CHEF
Mayor, as I've said before, I find that
flag to be racist and insensitive!


JIMBO
Chef, I respect you very much, but you
have to understand that this has been
the South Park flag since some of our
ancestors, like my great-grandfather,
founded this land!

CHEF
That flag represents a time when blacks
were persecuted by whites! How can a
black man not be bothered by it?!


MAYOR
Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants
hold up the flag.  and you tell me what
exactly you find racist about it.


CHEF
You don't see anything wrong with that
flag?!

JIMBO
Chef, what about the baseball team,
the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they
change their name because it's racist?


CHEF
Yeah!

JIMBO
No, because it's their history!

CHEF
Look, I have gone to every quiet protest
I could! I have written everyone; I've
put up signs! But now I'm telling you
, THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!

JIMBO
And I'm telling you it WON'T!

MAYOR
Oh, boy.

[South Park Elementary, day. The class bell rings and the kids
are in their seats. Timmy is now shown with the class.]

MR. WYLAND
Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence,
I would like to turn the class's attention
to current issues. Some people think
the South Park flag should be changed,
while others believe that changing the
flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect
subject for your debate club.

CLASS
Aaaaah!

MR. WYLAND
I see that you've already had a lot
of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice
vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman,
a-and People Against the Clubbing of
Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently,
the winner of all your debates so far
has been... Cartman.

CARTMAN
Thaaat's ri-ight.

KYLE
Cartman doesn't always win! He just
gets pissed off and goes home so we
can't debate anymore!

CLASS
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than
you guys!

STAN
You don't even know what you're debating
about half the time!

CARTMAN
Yes I do!

CRAIG
No you don't!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm
going home!

KYLE
Told ya.

MR. WYLAND
Alright, children, well, unlike Mr.
Garrison, I want you all to go out and
research this debate before we pick
teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose
which side of this poignant debate you
are on.

[Jimbo and Ned's lodge, after school. They're sitting on the
front porch.]

JIMBO
This is about history, kids.  If you
don't have respect for your past, then
you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then
you can never expect to have a future.
Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots
and flags because they're not  "politically
correct." Well, where does it end? I
mean, people are gonna start sayin'
that the Denver Broncos are offensive
to horses. And then we'll have to- a
SQUIRREL!  Aand then we'll have to change
everything, and pretty soon all our
history will be forgotten. But to REALLY
understand the South Park's flag's importance,
you need to know about South Park's
history. Ned here's a big history buff,
and he can tell you the whole story.
Ned?

NED
Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from
the East Coast traveled across the Plains-


STAN
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think
we got it.

KYLE
Yeah, we got it.

JIMBO
You sure?

STAN, KYLE
Yup.

JIMBO
You boys go make me proud now and win
that debate- Chris Peterson!  God-damnit,
we missed him again!

[South Park Supermarket, after school. Chef is at the entrance
with a petition in his hands. With him are Wendy, Bebe, Clyde,
and Butters. Some folks head for the store...]

CHEF
Sign up to join me, and come marchng
to the Mayor's office in protest of
the South Park flag!  You see that,
children?! Nobody wants to get involved!
Randy! Sign up to march with me against
the South Park flag on Wednesday?


RANDY
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m
not a racist, but uh, I just don't really
feel strongly one way or another about
the flag.

CHEF
Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled
to your own opinion.  That's how it
is in this town. I haven't gotten one
signature on this damn sheet, and I've
been here all day!

WENDY
We'll march with you, Chef.

CHEF
That's nice, but I need the support
of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey!
Sign up to march on Wednesday?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough.
I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh,
Thursday afternoon.

CHEF
Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone
else wanna go Thursday?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Thursday's no good, we've got chior
council.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, yeah.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What about next Sunday?

CHEF
Fine! Next Sunday!

MAN 1
You mean, during the ball game?

MAN 2
Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.

CHEF
Monday??

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, I can't do Monday.

MAN 3
I could do Tuesday.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.

MAN 1
You know what would be better for me
is Saturday afternoon.

MAN 2
Saturday is perfect for me.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?


MAN 3
Mm hmm.

MAN 2, WOMAN 2
Yeah.

MAN 1
Yeah.

MAN 3
That sounds good.

MAN 2
Mm hmm.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yeah, I think that's the best day.


CHEF
Okay! On Saturday, we march!

MAN 2
Oh, march? What are we marching for?


CHEF
To bring down the South Park Flag!


MAN 2
...Oh.

MAN 3
Oohh, I gotta go.

MAN 1
I know what I may like. I dont like
marching

WOMAN 2
Uh, marching's really not for me.

MAN 2
See you later.

MR. WYLAND
Well I've counted up all your secret
ballots, childen, and it look like about
half of you think the flag should stary,
and half think the flag should be changed.


WENDY
How could any of you think that flag
should stay the way it is?!

MR. WYLAND
Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm
going to assign the debate leaders.
Who wants to lead the "Flag Should Stay
The Way It Is" team?

STAN, KYLE
Me. Me. Me. Me.

WENDY
Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!


STAN
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong
with that flag.

KYLE
Yeah, me neither.

Mr. Wyland	Alright. Stan and Kyle, [turns and writes on the board]
you can both be the team leaders for the "Flag should stay the
way it is" team. [turns around. Their names are there now] Now,
who wants to lead the "Flag should be changed" team? [an angry
Wendy raises her hand. Cartman looks over at her, then raises
his hand and chuckles] Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up. [writes
their names on the board]

WENDY
Nooo!

MR. WYLAND
Alright, children. Do your homework,
and let's get ready for a great debate!


[South Park Elementary, cafeteria. Kids enjoy their meals. Craig
enters the kitchen, followed by Stan, Kyle, Butters, and someone
else]

STAN, KYLE
Hello, Chef.

CHEF
My name isn't Chef anymore, children.
I've converted to Islam.

STAN
Islam??

CHEF
From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed
Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone
in town so insensitive about the flag,
I find it no longer fitting to use my
slave name!

STAN
Well, we need help with our debate club.
We have to explain why we think the
flag should not be changed.

CHEF
You WHAT?!  You don't think they should
change the flag?!

KYLE
Not really.

STAN
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal
is.

CHEF
Well, that figures you don't! Because
your cracker-ass parents turned you
into little cracker-ass cracker-racists!
I never thought I'd live to see this
many of the people I considered friends
turn against me!

STAN
But Chef, we don't know what you're
talking about.

CHEF
But nothin'!  "But" my ass! Fix your
own damn food!

[South Park Elementary, school library. Wendy has assembled her
team and leads them through preliminary items. In her team are
Bebe, Clyde, Butters, Token, Kevin, and three others. Cartman
is not there yet.]

WENDY
Okay. Now, in order for us the debate
to change the South Park flag, we will
need to do a lot of research. Now, my
plan is to divide up into three research
teams. We will present our arguments
based on things that w-

CARTMAN
It's okay, I'm here.

WENDY
Nice of you to show up! We were just
discussing how we should state our case.


CARTMAN
Yes. This is a difficult case. In order
to win the debate, we will need to attack
Stan and Kyle's credibility.

WENDY
What??

CARTMAN
That's how you win these things: attack
your opponents' credibility!  Butters!
Take some kids and go dig up whatever
dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin'
booby magazines, whatever.

BUTTERS
Wwuhuh-o-kay!

CARTMAN
The rest of you, go get the goods on
Stan! His mom grounded him once for
setting something on fire. Let's find
out what that something was, and then
lie and say it was a puppy.

CLYDE
Right.

CARTMAN
Mmmm.

WENDY
Cartman, we can't just attack Stan
and Kyle's credibility. We need to present
our side of the debate.

CARTMAN
You're right. We'll need to look like
we prepared a case, too, so that they
look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo,
what's the issue again?

WENDY
The South Park flag!

CARTMAN
Interesting. Aaand, what side are we
on?

WENDY
D'aaaaahhh!

CARTMAN
Whoa! Calm down, ho.

[South Park City Hall, day. A Channel 4 field reporter is on
scene. Chef is in the background dressed in a daishiki facing
the Hall, with his fist up. Two groups of people are there, one
on either side of him. The mayor and her assistants look out
over the scene from her office]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out front of the
South Park Mayor's Office, where both
sides of this debate have gathered.


CHEF
Change the flag!

JIMBO
Don't change history!

MAYOR
Oh brother, what now?!

CHEF
Change the flag! Change the flag!...


REPORTER
Earlier, the South Park townspeople
voiced their opinion.

MAN 4
Well, I think the flag is racist!
Huh, but then again, it is part of our
history.

MAN 5
Well, I guess the flag is part of history,
...but I can see how it is racist.

MAN 6
I think it is history. I think it is
racist.

REPORTER
Well, one things for sure, tensions
are high and pressure is mounting on
the South Park Mayor to do something.


CHEF
...Change the flag! Change the flag!
Change the flag! Change the flag!  In
the 1960's there was a monk  who set
himself on fire to protest! You have
left me no choice!  To protest your
lack of humanity, I will now do the
same thing!

MONK
Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah!

THE KKK
White Power! White Power! White Power!
White Power! White Power! White Power!
White Power!

REPORTER
What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if
the KKK have shown up to espress their
opinion.

KKK LEADER
Hello, brother.  We are here to support
your noble cause.

JIMBO
Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your
support. We're not racists; this is
about history.

NED
Yeah.

KKK LEADER
Well, whether you want our support or
not, we're on your side!

THE KKK
White Power! White Power!  White Power!
White Power!  White Power! White Power!
White Power! White Power!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?


MR. GARRISON
NO, no,  but Mr. Hat is.

MR. HAT
White Power! White Power!

MR. GARRISON
Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr.
Hat.

THE KKK
White Power!

CHEF
Change the flag!

JIMBO
Don't change history!

MAYOR
Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.

[South Park City Hall, Mayor's office, later.]

MAYOR
Chef, we realize that you find the South
Park flag racist, and we certainly understand
your case.  We have been diligently
working on this problem, put in a lot
of hours, and we have finally altered
the flag in a way that we think will
make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There.
Is that better?

CHEF
No, damnit!

MAYOR
No, but look! He's got a little smile
now!  See? He's happy. Much better,
don't you think?  Well, some people
just won't with you at all. This is
getting out of hand. How do I absolve
myself of an responsibility with this?


JOHNSON
Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary
children are discussing the flag issue
in their debate club on Friday.

ASSISTANT
We... could use the debate as an excuse
to hold a vote on the issue.

MAYOR
Yes, of course. Let the children be
responsible. Everybody loves children.
Tell the press. South Park Elementary
will be holding a vote on Friday!


[South Park Elementary, school library. Wendy has three stacks
of books to pore over, Cartman is playing with his toys]

WENDY
This might come in handy. It says here
that recently a case was brought before
the South Carolina Court about their
flag, and they-

CARTMAN
I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock
Captain Candycone!

[as Bog Monster] O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you
in the nuts?!

WENDY
If we could show a parallel between
the South Carolina case-

CARTMAN
Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the
nuts!

[as Bog Monster] Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts!

[as Captain Candycone] I'll kick you in the nuts!

WENDY
Cartman, why don't you just go home?!
You aren't helping any!

CARTMAN
You won't let me help.

WENDY
That's because you're stupid, and you're
a racist!

CARTMAN
...Touché. But dude, you might as well
let me help you. We're in this together.
I mean, just... tell me what to do, and
I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help.
Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The
Bog Monster speaketh.

[South Park, the offices of Brovlofski and Jackson, Attorneys
At Law. Kyle and Stan have assembled their team there. Kenny,
Craig and Tweek are there with two others.]

KYLE
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says
we can use any of his books we want.
Who wants to read them?

STAN
Come on, you guys. We all have to work
on this!

KYLE
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are
you gonna eat? Jesus!

KENNY
(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's
poor.)

KYLE
I know your family's poor, but you can't
just eat an entire bowl of mints for
dinner.

KENNY
(Ah, fuck you!)

STAN
I don't think we stand a chance in this
debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other
side.

KYLE
Dude, you're just saying that because
she's your girlfriend.

KENNY
(Kyle, can I have a drink of water?)


KYLE
Yeah, you can have a drink of water.
The dispenser's over there.

STAN
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating
60 mints.

KYLE'S FATHER
Hey, boys, how's the research coming?


KYLE
Pretty good, I guess.

STAN
Do you think they should change the
flag?

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, uuhh. I don't know.

KYLE
Kenny ate all the mints, dad.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, those weren't mints, those were
antacid tablets.

KYLE
Oh.

STAN, KYLE
Kenny!

KENNY
(What?)  (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!)

STAN
That was a good one.

[South Park City Hall. The KKK is still rallying. Mr. Hat keeps
Mr. Garrison in place]

THE KKK
White Power! White Power!

KKK LEADER
Do not change the flag! It is a symbol
of white power!

THE KKK
White Power!

MR. GARRISON
Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a
racist son of a bitch.

MR. HAT
Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!


MR. GARRISON
Dugh!  Ogh. Waaaaah!

CHEF
How can you all just stand by and let
these racists do this?!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech.
We don't like it, but we can't arrest
them for talking.

REPORTER
Should the Klan be allowed to rally
on the steps of the Capitol? Here's
what some people think.

MAN 7
Well, I think they are racist, but I...
do think freedom of speech is important.


MAN 8
Well, I, for one, believe in freedom
of speech. ...Mmm but then again, I think
they are racist.

MAN 9
Well, I believe that they are racist,
but I do believe that all-

CHEF
Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive
bastards!

REPORTER
On Friday, South Park Elementary will
present its debate, and after the debate,
there will finally be a vote. Preliminary
polls show three in favor of changing
the flag, three against changing the
flag, and 4382 undecided. So the pressure
in on those South Park kids!

KKK LEADER
Well, that's enough rallying for this
afternoon, members. Let's take a hot
shower!

THE KKK
Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower!


JIMBO
Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side
if it's the side those KKK members are
on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to
them.

[South Park Elementary, school library, night. Wendy and Cartman
are both laboring over books. Between them is a tray of Oreo
cookies.]

WENDY
I can't believe it. All the pressure's
on us. I mean, this debate is going
to actually affect the outcome of the
vote.

CARTMAN
Uh huh.

WENDY
Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals
to the history argument.

CARTMAN
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?


WENDY
Huh?

CARTMAN
I mean, Germany was united under the
swastika, right? But,... obviously history
wasn't as important as changing the
views after the war and stuff, so hey
changed it.

WENDY
Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.


CARTMAN
Yeah.

WENDY
Not bad at all. I may make that our
first argument.

CARTMAN
Cool.

WENDY
Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.


CARTMAN
Really? Mine too. What I really like
to do, is I like to take the tops off
of two cookies, and then put them together
and make "quadruple stuffs."

WENDY
Hey, that's what I always do, too!


CARTMAN
No way!

WENDY
Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have
anything in common with you, Cartman.


CARTMAN
Me neither.

WENDY
Aha ha.

CARTMAN
Huh.

WENDY, CARTMAN
Well, anyway, let's get back to work.


CARTMAN
Whoa.

WENDY
Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say
that first we talk about the history
of the flag.  We can show that the-


CARTMAN
Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.

WENDY
No.  You go ahead.

[Mr. Garrison's house, night. The living room. Mr. Garrison enters]


MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?


MR. HAT
There's another Klan rally tonight;
I have to be there in 15 minutes.


MR. GARRISON
Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging
to another Klan meeting.

MR. HAT
But they're electing a new assistant
to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.


MR. GARRISON
Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll
have nothin' to do with it!

MR. HAT
I'm going whether you like it or not!


MR. GARRISON
Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and
that's final!  Let's just see you try
and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?

[South Park, the woods. The KKK rallies around a burning cross.]


THE KKK
White Power! White Power! White Power!
White Power! White Power! White Power!
White Power! White Power!

JIMBO
Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful.
These are really evil men we're dealing
with.

NED
Mmm-okay.

JIMBO
Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have
a volume control?

NED
No.

THE KKK
White Power! White Power!

KKK LEADER
Good evening, brothers. Our first order
of business tonight is to have Brother
Anderson update us on last week's minutes.


BROTHER ANDERSON
Last week we decided we hate blacks
and Jews. A lot!

KKK LEADER
Alright. And now it's time for us all
to come together, and... do our cake raffle.


KKK MEMBERS
Oh, cake raffle.

KKK LEADER
This week's winner is...  uh, 2 9 7 4.


TICKET 2974 HOLDER
I won, I won.  I won the cake!

KKK LEADER
God job, brother.

[A green and flowering meadow under a brilliant orange dawn.
A happy Wendy walks in and grabs some flowers, then sniffs them
deeply. She then looks behind her to find Cartman sitting on
a white steed under a bright yellow sun. The steed neighs]


WENDY
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Ahh!

WENDY
Say it'll be like this forever.

CARTMAN
Okay, It will be like this forever.


WENDY
Oh, Cartman!

[Wendy's room, night. She rises in bed with a start. That scene
in the meadow was a dream]

WENDY
AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with
me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl.


CARTMAN'S VOICE
Wendih.  Wendih.

WENDY
Aaaah!

CARTMAN'S VOICE
Wendih, look at me.

WENDY
Oh God, please don't let this be happening.


[South Park, the woods, deep in the night.]

KKK LEADER
Alright brothers, listen up!  As you
know, this fine city is holding a vote
on whether or or not to change their
flag. But lynching minorities is history!
So what are we gonna do about it?!


MEMBER 1
Let's say that if they change the flag,
we'll burn down the Capitol!

KKK MEMBERS
Yeah!

MEMBER 2
Let's say that if they change the flag,
we'll never leave this town!

KKK MEMBERS
Yeah!

JIMBO
Let's say they should change the flag!


KKK MEMBERS
Yeah!  Wah?

KKK LEADER
Uh what's that, brother?

JIMBO
I thnk we should switch sides!

NED
Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.

JIMBO
Look, we have to accept the fact that
most people in the world hate us, right?


KKK MEMBERS
Yeah, m-hm.

JIMBO
So, whatever side we're on is the side
that's gonna lose, right?

KKK MEMBERS
Right, yeah.

JIMBO
So why don't we all say that we want
the flag changed. That way, most folks'll
vote to keep it the way it is.

KKK LEADER
That's a great idea, brother!

KKK MEMBERS
Yeah!

KKK LEADER
Alright, it is decided! We will officially
tell everyone that we want the flag
changed, so that they will all vote
against us!

KKK MEMBERS
Hooray, yeah!

A MEMBER
We'e smart!

JIMBO
That worked perfectly, Ned.

KKK LEADER
Well alright, now that that's out of
the way, it is time to play, "Whose
got the silliest thing on under their
robe?"

KKK MEMBERS
Yeah, woohoo!

[The contest. The first member walks down the middle and shows
off his boxers with a heart design. The second comes in and shows
off his lederhosen. The third comes in and shows off bikini briefs
and garters. The fourth comes in and shows off a yellow bird
costume.]

JIMBO
Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely
nuts.

NED
Mm-yup.

[the fifth member comes in and shows off his hand-walking skills,
and the sixth one shows off his penis... Jimbo and Ned walk away
from the scene]

JIMBO
That is the most insane thing I've
ever seen. I can't believe those people
are on our side. I mean, is our side
that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate
tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes!
Chef, this isn't what it looks like.
You've gotta listen to us!

CHEF
I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This
whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!


JIMBO
Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe
history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.


[Wendy's house, morning, before school. Living room]

WENDY
Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have
something to tell you.

BEBE
Sure, what?

WENDY
Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.

BEBE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

WENDY
I know.

BEBE
Why would you tell me this? Why would
you tell anyone this?

WENDY
Because I don't know what to do. I can't
concentrate, and if I can't concentrate,
then I can't win the debate tomorrow.
The whole vote is dependent on me doing
a good job-

BEBE
Alright, look. When two people work
closely for a long time, sometimes they
feel what's called, "sexual tension."
Sometimes you just have to act on impulse
and get it over with.

WENDY
You mean, I should kiss him?

BEBE
Kiss him and get it out of your system.


WENDY
Oh God.

[South Park Elementary, the gym. Mr. Wyland is shown behind a
podium, and the South Park flag hangs from some rafters behind
him. Two tables are set up, one for each side of the debate.
Behind the "FLAG SHOULD STAY THE SAME" table are Stan, Kyle,
and two other boys. Behind the "FLAG SHOULD CHANGE" table are
Wendy, Cartman, Token, and Butters.]

MR. WYLAND
Well I certainly would like to thank
all the parents for their support of
our debate club.  I r-realize that many
of you are torn by the issues as well,
so, perhaps the children can shed some
light on us. We'll start with Wendy
Testaburger on the "Flag Should Be Changed"
team.

WENDY
The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the... the-
uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-
ah...  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh
God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?


PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE
Oh.

REALLY SHOCKED MAN
Oh, God!

WENDY
Yes. Now, the main point we would like
to make is oftentimes it is prudent
to change history. As times change we
hope to grow, and as we grow our rules
must change. It is a natural part of
evolution. Thank you.

MR. WYLAND
Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your
main point?

KYLE
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't
offend anyone, because killing has been
around since the bieginning of time.
All animals kill.  And the animals that
don't kill are stupid ones, like cows
and turtles and stuff. So people should
not be so upset about killing.

CHEF
Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the
point entirely!

KYLE
Huh?

CHEF
I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody
gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!


KYLE'S TEAM
Racist??

CHEF
Children, don't you even know what this
argument is about?! That flag is racist
because a black man is being hung by
white people.

KYLE'S TEAM
Ooooooohhh.

CHEF
Ooooooohhh?!

KYLE
W-we really didn't see it that way.


CHEF
But that's a black man up there!

KYLE
Y-yeah, but... the color of someone's
skin doesn't matter.

CHEF
Well of course it matters when-  ...Oh
my God. Wait a minute. You children
didn't even see the flag as a black
man being hanged by white people, did
you?

KYLE'S TEAM
No.

CHEF
Why, that is- that is the most beautiful
thing I have ever heard.

MAYOR
What?

MR. WYLAND
What?

CHEF
Don't you see? All this time I thought
these little crackers had turned racist,
when actuallih they were so not racist
that they didn't even make a separation
of black and white to begin with. All
they saw when they looked at that flag
was five people.

A FEW PEOPLE
Awww.

SOME KKK MEMBERS
Awww.

KYLE
Yeah.

CHEF
I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about
you. But I still the flag needs to be
changed. But now I realize that I almost
let racism turn me into a racist.


JIMBO
Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found
myself on the side of Klan menbers.
I've never had anything against blacks,
Chef.

CHEF
Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known
you for almost ten years. You're a good
man.

JIMBO
We've been way too divisive over this,
Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise
flagsomething that everybody can be
happy with.

CHEF
I think that's a much better start than
me tryin' to separate myself from all
you wonderful crackers.

AUDIENCE MEMBERS
Ooh, huhuh. Oooh

KYLE
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have
to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?


[South Park City Hall, day. The Mayor has called a town meeting
at City Hall and now stands at her podium with the town gathered
before her. Something hangs above her covered by a brown curtain]


MAYOR
This has been an interesting week in
South Park. We've all done a lot of
growing this week.  Everyone was afraid
to take a stand on this issue. But now
we have learned once again that black,
white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we
are all just people. And so, I am very
excited to unveil our new South Park
Flag!

STAN
Wait, I don't get it.

KYLE
No, see? There's people of all colors.
And they added a black guy as one of
the hangers, too, so it's not racist.


CHEF
Hooray!

JIMBO
I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.


WENDY
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.


CARTMAN
Me, too!

WENDY
I can't believe how right Bebe was
about feeling under pressure with somebody.
As soon as it was over, all my feelings
for you just vanished.

CARTMAN
Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.


WENDY
I'm totally back to normal. See you
later.

CARTMAN
Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, huhuh,
he, haha.

WENDY
Hahaha.  Stan. Stan, wait up!

"SUMMER SUCKS"

Written by

Nancy Pimental & Trey Parker



[South Park Elementary. Class is in session]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, I know that today is
the last day of school, and that the
last day of school involves pranks,
but this is going too far! What have
you done with Mr. Hat?!  Children, I
want Mr. Hat right now!  The prank is
over!  You think I can't get along without
Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't
live without him. Well, I can! He's
just a puppet. I don't need him. You
see? Watch.  GOD DAMMIT, WHERE THE FUCK
DID YOU PUT MR. HAT?!

KIDS
YEH-

MR. GARRISON
Oh, no, you don't! The school year
is over, but summer vacation doesn't
start for you little bastards, until
Mr. Hat is back on my desk!

KIDS
AAWWWW!

MR. GARRISON
Now, I'm goin' to turn around, and when
I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat
lying right here!  Okay. Now I'm gonna
turn around now.  Shit!

PIP
Where did everybody go?

[Outside. The kids bolt through the school's front door]

KIDS
Yea! Hooray!

CARTMAN
It's summer!

[the snow melts away, and a mound of it reveals a boy whose missing
person's poster was in the back of the class. He gets up, and
his parents rush up to meet him]

MOM
Oh golly, Kevin honey.

DAD
Good to see ya again, son.

[the boys don't take the bus home today. They walk past a house
where a man stretches in the warm breeze]

Man at doorway	Looks like winter is right around the corner.
Better get some firewood ready. [uses a chainsaw on the tree
in front of the house. Trees all over the area are coming down]


[A park, and kids are at play already. The boys walk through
it. Fosse chases a ball. Jordan and the soiled kid stand next
to each other, but a ball hits the soiled kid and knocks him
down. Pip is farther away.]

PIP
Oh! Have a good summer, gentlemen!


STAN
Shut up, Pip!

PIP
Right-o. Uh. Enjoy some of this summer
for me, would you?

KYLE
What do ya mean?

PIP
Welluh I have to spend my summer in
summer school. Because I can't be left
alone. You see, my parents are dead.


CARTMAN
Your parents are dead? God-damn you
suck, Pip!

Stu's Fireworks

[they stop and read the sign]

STAN
Oh yeah, dude. It's summer. That means
we have to go buy fireworks.

KYLE
I saved up enough money to buy M-80's
this year.

STAN
I saw in this movie once, where this
guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.


KYLE
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's
cat.

CARTMAN
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's
ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nut
sack, and blow your balls out all over
your panties!

STAN
Jesus, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Well, I'm just checking, man. Don't
mock my kitty, man.

STU'S FIREWORK SHACK

STU
Hi, fellas.

BOYS
Hi, Stu.

STU
What can I do for you?

KYLE
We wanna buy M-80's.

STAN
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's
ass.

CARTMAN
Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys, I'm
going home.

KYLE
What a baby.

STAN
So we'll have ten M-80's, please.

STU
I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?


STAN
Heard what?

STU
All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.


KYLE
What do ya mean?

STU
It was in the paper this morning

KYLE
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North
Park kid blew his hands off, we don't
get to buy our M-80's?

STU
Right.

STAN
How can they do this to us? Doesn't
anyone believe in tradition anymore?


KYLE
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers
our whole lives.

[Kyle remembers their days as toddlers. All four stand in a hallway
holding lit firecrackers. Kyle tosses one up in the air and it
pops. Kenny holds on to his, to his peril. It pops, and Kenny's
head flies off his torso. The rest of the body falls over]


STAN
Oh my gosh ih killed Kenny!

KYLE
Oo bastards!

STAN
A summer without fireworks is like
I don't know, but it's like-uh, ih,
it sucks ass.

KYLE
Yeah-uh now what are we supposd to do?


STU
I can still sell snakes.

STAN, KYLE
Hwaah.

KENNY
(Never mind)

[City Hall. The Mayor is in]

THE MAYOR
This is absurd. We need fireworks for
our Fourth of July celebration at the
lake.  I don't care that some twerp
blew his hands off! We've got to have
fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've
got another call.  Hello? No, I don't
know where Mr. Hat is. Jesus, Garrison,
I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes?
Now what am I supposed to do about our
Fourth of July show at the lake? NO,
I don't want snakes! This is an outrage!
Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass,
I was being ironic!

BARBRADY
Oh I'm sorry Mayor, but I couldn't
find the little man in the boat.

THE MAYOR
Well, keep looking!

BARBRADY
Oh?

THE MAYOR
This is ridiculous. We can't have a
celebration without fireworks. Whoever
heard of a Fourth of July picnic with
snakes?

BARBRADY
Oh I like snakes. You light 'em and
they grow and grow.

THE MAYOR
Wait a minute, that's it! I've got it.
This year, South Park will make history
by having the largest snake in the world!
The press will love it. I'll be on the
front peh-  Oooooogh.

BARBRADY
Huh, I found him.

[The bus stop. The boys just can't seem to get into summer wear]


STAN
Man, it's hot out here.

CARTMAN
What do you guys want to do? We've got
the whole summer to play.

KYLE
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We
always just play with fireworks.

STAN
I know, let's go sledding!

KYLE
Yeah!

[The top of a hill. The boys have brought their sled, and Cartman
is left to go on]

STAN
Come on, Cartman. Get on.

CARTMAN
Stan?

KYLE
Come on, dude, we're ready.

STAN
The hell are you waiting for?

CARTMAN
Huh. Don't you notice anything wrong
with this picture?

KYLE
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled.


CARTMAN
Ahem. What ever.

STAN
What the hell's goin' on?

JIMBO
Hey there, boys!

STAN
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

JIMBO
How come you're not blowin' things up?
It's summer.

KYLE
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks
'cause a little boy blew off his hands.


JIMBO
What?!

STAN
Yeah, they're not even having 'em at
the lake this year.

JIMBO
Oh my God!  Well, don't worry boys.
Uncle Jimbo is on the case.  Buckle
your seat belt, Ned.

NED
Mmmm-where are we going?

JIMBO
Mejico, my amigo.

NED
Mmmm-why are we going to Mejico?

JIMBO
Buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid
blew off his hands doesn't mean the
rest of us have to suffer now, does
it?

NED
Are fireworks legal in Mexico?

JIMBO
Hell, everything's legal in Mejico.
It's the American way.

[The Mayor's office. Her aides are there now.]

CHARLIE
At the Dyno Might Firework Company,
we have a commitment to excellence.
Our focus is on safety while th-


THE MAYOR
Just cut to the chase and tell us about
the snake!

CHARLIE
Uh oh-kay.  Let's see.  Weh-. Now the
disk that we are making is approximately
5000 times bigger than the average snake.


THE MAYOR
Ooooo!

CHARLIE
We have to fly it in with three Comanche
helicopters and lower it onto the ground
at the lake.

THE MAYOR
Comanche helicopters

CHARLIE
Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all
set up around the perimeter of the disk,
that are all triggered to fire at the
same time.

THE MAYOR
flamethrowerstriggered at the same
time

CHARLIE
Once lit, the snake will- grow.  And
good times will be had by all.

AIDE 1
Wonderful.

AIDE 2
Spectacular.

THE MAYOR
Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake
will not only go on, but perhaps be
the best ever. Wait a minute! We're
gonna need an orchestra to play the
Stars and Stripes!

AIDE 1
Hey! How about the elementary school
orchestra? They had a great version
of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last
concert.

THE MAYOR
Yyes! Get the school principal on the
phone! And we need somebody to dress
up like Uncle Remus!

AIDE 2
Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?


THE MAYOR
Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!


[On the side of a road. The boys are building a snowman, but
out of mud. A mudman]

KYLE
Dusty, the dirtball

STAN
Why does everything have to suck so
bad in summer?

KYLE
Hehey, look. It's Mr. Garrison

MR. GARRISON
Hhello, children. Hhhow is your summer
goinnngg?

STAN
Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.

KYLE
Hey! Have you found Mr. Hat yet?

MR. GARRISON
Oohh oh, that old thing?  Whah, I almost
forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr.
Hat.

STAN
That's good.

MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat is just a puppet

KYLE
Yeup.

MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat isn't real.

STAN
Right.

CARTMAN
Hey you guys. My mom signed me up for
swimming lessons at the community pool;
you wanna come?

STAN
Swimming lessons, dude? That is the
lamest thing I've ever heard!

CARTMAN
Is not!

STAN
Everyone knows that the first graders
pee in the community pool.

KYLE
Hyeah, Cartman. You're swimming around
in first-grader pee!

CARTMAN
Dah-I'm not swimming around in pee!


STAN
Whatever, dude!

CARTMAN
My mom says if I take swimming lessons,
I could be in the Olympics some day.


KYLE
Heyeah, the Fatass Olympics.

CARTMAN
I am trying to make the best out of
a bad situation! I don't need to hear
crap, from a bunch of hippie freaks
living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm
going home.

STAN
But Cartman, we're tryin' to-

CARTMAN
Hup- Screw you guys. Home.

STAN
What does he mean, living in denial?


KYLE
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being
a dumbass like always.

STAN
There. How does that look?

KYLE
Like a- big hunk o' dirt with a carrot
sticking out of it.

We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas

NED
Hmmm-bueyno.

[A house. Mr. Garrison is in his armchair next to a phone looking
at TV. A picture of Mr. Hat is in one of his bookshelves. Riinngggg]


MR. GARRISON
Hello:

Hello, is Mr. Hat there?

MR. GARRISON

Lamb Chop	As long as we're together, we can do anything.

We can take on the whole darned world.

We're happy as clams, we've got plenty of pearls.

Through thick and thin, we've always been together

INSTRUCTOR
Just do your side stroke.

CARTMAN

No way! Sons of bitches, I'm going home!


[News 4 brief]

ANCHOR
Fourth of July is finally here, and
with the statewide ban on fireworks,
people from all over Colorado are flocking
to South Park. Here with a special report
is a normal-looking guy with a funny
name.

CREAMY GOODNESS
Thanks, Tom, it looks like the firework
ban won't be putting a damper on one
town's festivities tonight. I'm here
at Stark's Pond in South Park, where
the crowd of residents and scores of
tourists anxiously await the lighting
of the largest snake in human history.
Now, as most of you will probably remember,
snakes are these little round disks
that you light, and they spew out a
little snake of black ash. Well, the
South Park snake is over half a mile
in diameter, and twenty stories high.
I'm told that this event won't begin
until the sun goes down and night is
upon us.  Well alrighty then, looks
like we're ready.

[Orchestra stage. Everyone is present and ready to play]

STAN
How are your swimming lessons going,
Cartman?

CARTMAN
Fine.

KYLE
I heard you won't even get in the deep
end!

CARTMAN
Well, you heard wrong, hippie!

[A wide view of Stark's Pond and everyone in the area around
it. Then, the mayor is on the main stage with her aides about
to address the crowd]

THE MAYOR
Ladies and Gentlemen, good citizens
of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be
the first person to wish you all a Happy
Fourth of July! Let's start with our
school band playing the Stars and Stripes!


CONDUCTOR
This is it. And a-one and a-two and
a-

PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
Oooohhh!

THE MAYOR
What the fuck is that?!

AIDE 2
I think it's the Stars and Stripes.


THE MAYOR
Oh, hell!  Light the smake!

THE CROWD
Ooooo!  Aaaah!

[Mexico, near the border at night. Jimbo and Ned drive by an
abandoned truck]

JIMBO
Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to
the Amrican border. They can't know
that we have fireworks in the trunk.
Just let me do the talking.  Ha ha ha
ha, I guess that goes without saying,
doesn't it?

[The border]

WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

[Jimbo and Ned drive up. The border agents attend to them]

ALTO|STOP

AGENT
Good evening, gentlemen.

JIMBO
Hello there, fellow American. We're
just anxious to get back to our homeland.


AGENT
Oh alright, I just need to ask you a
few questions.

JIMBO
Fire away, we have nothing to hide.


AGENT
Is anyone other than the two of you
traveling in this vehicle?

JIMBO
No, sir.

AGENT
Do you have any firearms or explosives
in the car?

JIMBO
Yeah.  I mean, no! No.

AGENT
Open your trunk, please, sir.

JIMBO
Damn! Damn, I always get that question
wrong.

[Stark's pond. The crowds are still cheering and the band is
still playing, and the snake is still growing. Cartman looks
intently at his sheet music]

THE MAYOR
My God, it's beautiful. It never fails
to amaze me how I manage to overcome
adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does
that thing die out?

CHARLIE
Die out?

THE MAYOR
Yes. You know, expire, end.  Hello,
I'm asking you when it stops!

CHARLIE
Uuuh, Aha'm not sure, uh. I never made
one this big. I guess we didn't quite
think this through, did we?

THE MAYOR
What?!

KYLE
Dude. That thing is huge.

STAN
Yeah, they need to shut it off.

CARTMAN
Hey, you guys are screwin' up the song!


[the crowd is now alarmed as well as awed. Grumbles are heard]


MAN 1
Somebody stop it!

MAN 2
It's out of control!

[Everyone leaves in a hurry. A piece of the ashen snake breaks
off and the main pillar lies down and starts moving through the
crowd.]

A WOMAN
Nooo!

[The snake heads for the orchestra stage and all the students
jump off, except]

KYLE
Kenny, watch out!

KENNY
(Damn!)  (Oof! Hey you guys, I really,
really don't have time to tell you that-aargh)


Stan	Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastards!

THE MAYOR
Oh my God!  You tell me how much longer
this thing is gonna last!!

CHARLIE
Huh nowuh, let's see. At normal speed,
snake lasts three minutes, this is in
con- athuthuthuthuthu a normal snake-


THE MAYOR
So when does it run out?!

CHARLIE
November. Of next year.

THE MAYOR
Oh, hell!

[The rest of the crowd rushes off in all directions. Kyle picks
up a violin and starts playing a dirge. Stan returns and looks
at him, then takes up his own violin. Then come Cartman, Bill,
Fosse, and the black kid to take up their instruments. This time,
they sound pretty good]

[July 5, 6 A.M., Stark's Pond. News 4 coverage resumes]

CREAMY GOODNESS
Well, we're coming up on nine hours,
and the giant snake of South Park shows
no signs of stopping. Residents have
tried everything from firehoses to yelling
at it to make the snake stop. But nothing
seems to work.

TOM
Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising
all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe
the ashen air, and not ever light any
giant snakes in the near future.

[The snake is now some thirty feet wide and moving down South
Park's main thoroughfare, incinerating everything in its path]


STAN
Man, this sucks!

KYLE
What should we do, dude? The big snake
keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the
whole state soon.

STAN
Well we should do what we always do:
ask Chef.

CARTMAN
Where is Chef?

[An island in the Caribbean]

CHEF



[slowly] Baby you know you're the girrrl, for meeee

And aallll that I want to bee-ee-ee-ee is


[faster, with a beat] You. And me. And her. Simultaneous

You. And me. And you, and you! Simultaneous

[rrring. He answers] Hello? What? Oh, hello, children! It's a

you know I rarely say this, but, wellll fudge ya. [hangs up
and resumes singing]


Simultaneous

You. And me. And you, and you! Simultaneous

Lovin', baby. Two or three, heheh.

[South Park. The smoke is heavy in the air. Stan hangs up the
phone]

KYLE
What did he say?

STAN
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck
ourselves.

CARTMAN
Wow!

KYLE
How's that gonna help?

Well um, let me ask you this: why-?
Where, where do you think Mr. Hat

How the fuck should I know?! If I knew

a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.


PSYCHIATRIST
That I did not need to know.

MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm just sayin

PSYCHIATRIST
Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was
actually your gay side trying to come
out. You see, it's it's you that's gay,
but, but you're in denial. So, you act
out your gay persona, with a homosexual
puppet.  What do you think about that?

[Stan's backyard, day. The boys are playing the "Investigative
Reports with Bill Curtis" game when Timmy and Jimmy arrive]


JIMMY
Hey fellas.

STAN
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmy!!!

JIMMY
Say fellas, JImmy and I were wondering
if maybe you would come and cheer for
us next Sssaturday. We're both competing
in the Special Olympics down in Denver.


CARTMAN
The Special Olympics? What's so special
about them?

KYLE
They're Olympic games for handicapped
people.

CARTMAN
Dude, what?

JIMMY
Timmy and I are competing in a variety
of events.

STAN
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and
Timmy on.

KYLE
Yeah, that'd be cool.

JIMMY
Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta
get down to the training center and
start working out. Word is we have a
lot of ssstiff competition this year.


KYLE
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday,
guys.

TIMMY
Timmy!!!

CARTMAN
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped
people like this. I mean, making them
compete against each other just for
our amusement.

KYLE
...You're an asshole, Cartman.

CARTMAN
What? What did I do?

[Denver Athletic Club, Denver, day.]

WELCOME


SPECIAL OLYMPICS

ATHLETES !

[Inside, the athletes are working out on a variety of equipment.
Jimmy and Timmy are at a bench press. Jimmy presses weights as
Timmy spots him.]

JIMMY
...six!...

TIMMY
Timmih.

JIMMY
Usss-usss-seven!

TIMMY
Timmih. Timmih!

JIMMY
Usss-usss-seven!

TIMMY
Timmih! Timmiiih!

JIMMY
Ni-I can'-I can't!  Huff. Oh man.
Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have
some ppppretty stiff competition this
year.  All of the special athletes seem
to be in tip-top condition, and I can't
even get past seven ru-reps. Huhh oh
well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p--p-pooped.
I'll see you in the locker room.

TIMMY
Otimmih.

FRANCIS
Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.


JIMMY
You too, Francis.

BIG ATHLETE
Hey Jimmy.

JIMMY
Oh hey hey, n-Nathan.

NATHAN
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.


JIMMY
Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training
really hard, but I'm not improving fast
enough, and the Special Olympics are
a... week away.

NATHAN
Wellll, maybe I can- help you out. You
know, there are shortcuts.

JIMMY
What kind of shortcuts?

NATHAN
You know. Steroids.

JIMMY
S-s--ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't
those illegal?

NATHAN
Yeah, sure, but these are new. They
don't show up in our urine tests.


JIMMY
So uh, ha-how do they... w-wwork?

NATHAN
You just take one of these little blue
babies  three times a day  and inject
this directly into your bloodstream
twice a day before meals.

JIMMY
How much would this cost me?

NATHAN
Ahhh it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep
vice off my back and secure shipments
from overseas.

JIMMY
Well... then maybe I'll just use them
a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance
en...hancer.

NATHAN
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.
Whatever you say.

[Stan's house, front yard. The boys are playing with various
toy big rigs. Stan moves a gas truck, Kenny an ambulance, Kyle
a tow truck]

CARTMAN
YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS! I have the best
idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!

KYLE
What?

CARTMAN
Dude, I was just looking at the Special
Olympics brochure, and check this shit
out: "At the end of the Special Olympics,
a Grand Champion Special Athlete is
crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"


STAN
So?

CARTMAN
So?? So dude, think about it. If somebody
just pretended to be mentally handicapped,
they could easily win the competition
and get the thousand bucks!

KYLE
Oh no. Cartman, no!

CARTMAN
It's flawless! I'll act like I have
a disability, and when the time come
to compete I'll kick ass against all
the handicappeds!

STAN
That's really, really terrible, dude.


CARTMAN
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys's brains
just can't compute complex plans like
mine can! It'll work, you'll see.


KYLE
Cartman! I will not stand by and let
you cheat your way to winning the Special
Olympics!

CARTMAN
Why?

KYLE
Because!

CARTMAN
What are you gonna do, Kyle? Tell on
me?  Then you'll be a great big no-good
double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!
Is that really how you deal with your
problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have
to do is make people think I'm handicapped,
and I get a thousand dollars. It won't
be easy, but nothing worth having ever
is.

CARTMAN
Darrrr. Durrrr. I wanna be in the Special
Olympics.  Bull's eye!

[Jimmy's house, bedroom, night. Jimmy is at his bed. He straps
on a strip of heavy rubberband, dabs his arm a few times with
alcohol, jabs the syringe into his arm and injects some liquids
steroids into his arm. He loosens the rubber band and someone
knocks on his door. He looks around and jumps off his bead]


JIMMY
Oh! Agh! Just, just a second!

DAD
Jimmy?

JIMMY
Hang on, I'm I'm, coming.

DAD
Jim, it's your father!

JIMMY
I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned
s-second!  Hold it.

DAD
Jimmy, were you masturbating?

JIMMY
Nn-no, Dad.

DAD
Okay. Well, you have a visitor.

GIRL
Hi Jimmy.

JIMMY
Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.

NANCY
I was hoping we would study for the
spelling test tomorrow.

JIMMY
Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.

DAD
I didn't know you had a girlfriend,
Jim.

JIMMY
Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since
we met in Free Period last week.

DAD
I'll leave you two alone.  Y-you sure
you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's
okay if you were.

JIMMY
Dad, Jesus C-Christ!

DAD
Okay then.

[A basketball court, day. The boys take turn shooting hoops,
but none of them make a basket. Cartman waddles into view in
his handicapped getup]

CARTMAN
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's
going on? Drrrrrt.

KYLE
God damn you!

CARTMAN
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics
Championship and my one thousand dollars
is just four days away.  I'm going to
go sign up now.

KYLE
No you're not!  I read the brochure,
Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you
have to have a parent with you to sign
up for the Special Olympics.

CARTMAN
What??

KYLE
It says right there "a parent has to
be with you to sign up," and you'll
never get your mom to agree to something
so horrible, so HA!

[Cartman's house, later. Liane is at the kitchen table paying
bills. Cartman walks in from the dining room. He puts his arms
behind his back]

CARTMAN
Moooommmmm?

LIANE
Yes, hon?

CARTMAN
Um, could I get you to do something
for me?

LIANE
What's that, hon?

CARTMAN
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little
strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um,
moommm? Would you mind coming with me
to sign up for the Special Olympics
so I can beat all the handicapped kids
and win a thousand dollare?

LIANE
Oh... Nno, sweetie. I believe those
Olympics are just for ..."special" children.


CARTMAN
I'm not special? I thoght you always
said I was special.

LIANE
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's
a very good idea.

CARTMAN
...I'll split the money with you.


LIANE
...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No.


CARTMAN
All right, Mom, look. Here's ...the
truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to
say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard
on some of the handicapped kids at school
in the past. I've sometimes looked at
people with disabilities as people God
put here on earth for my amusement,
but... now I'm starting to think...
that if I could just spend one day in
their shoes, ...if I could just see
the challenges they face every day,
...mauye I wouldn't be so cold. I just
want a chance to change.  Help me change?


LIANE
Oh, a-a-all right, sweetie, I, I'll
take you tomorrow.

CARTMAN
Awesome.

[Denver Athletic Club, day. Jimmy and Timmy are in the locker
room getting ready to leave]

JIMMY
You did a great job in the 500, Timmy.
You really im-...p-p-proved.

TIMMY

TIMMY

JIMMY

TIMMY
Huh! Timmih! T-Timmih!

JIMMY
Look, it's my body and it's my choice
what I put in it!

TIMMY
Timmih! Timmih, Jimmih.  Arrrh Timmih!
Jimmih!

JIMMY
Don't lecture me on the complexities
of sportsmanship. You know as well as
I do most of the kids in Special Olympics
aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just
trying to k-keep up.

TIMMY
Huh... Timmih...  Timmih.

JIMMY
Sssso what are you gonna do now, huh?!
You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show
that bbottle to the ...coaches?!  Don't
think you're any better than me, Timmy!
I'm just living in the real world!

for the javelin throw]

TIMMY
Timmih!  Aaagyaaaaah Timmih!

COACH
All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep

Wohuhow, Jimmy, I can't believe how

JIMMY
Yeah, I've been working out... r-r-really

VOLUNTEER

[The Special Olympic Field, under the bleachers. Jimmy prepares
to inject more steroids into his right arm]

JIMMY
Yeah, b-bigger, stronger!

[South Park Elementary, day. Timmy rolls to Mr. Mackey's office,
sighs and knocks.]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in.  I understand

[Cartman's room, night. Cartman types away at his computer]


CARTMAN

How I Will Spend My

One Thousand Dollars

By Eric Cartman

[a knock is heard at his door] Enter! [the door opens and Kyle
enters, stand there for a while, closes the door, then walks
up to Cartman. A few moments of uneasy silence follows]

KYLE
Cartman, I really, really have a problem
with what you're doing. I object to
it morally, and I find it grossly offensive.


CARTMAN
Go on, Kyle.

KYLE
I know that I often have serious moral
objections to the things that you do,
but... this time I think you really
need to reconsider, because if you do
this, I believe you will go to hell.
So I feel it is my responsibility, as
your friend, to tell people what you're
doing, and to put a stop to it!

CARTMAN
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're
coming from, and I appreciate you being
so direct. Um, the thing is, you really
have kind a warped view on morality
because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you
haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film,
The Passion but-

KYLE
I didn't come here to talk about The
Passion, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion
you would know that Hell is reserved
for the Jews, and all those who don't
accept Christ. That being the case,
it is actually me who is worried about
your soul.

KYLE
I came here to talk about you!

CARTMAN
Yes.  And instead you had to break through
yourself. This is really the beginning
of a whole new chapter of your life,
Kyle.  Good luck.

[Jimmy's house. He's working out on a bench press in his room.
A mirror sits next to him]

JIMMY
Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice
p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps.

NANCY
Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at
the doughnut shop.

JIMMY
The Games are in two days, Nancy. I
can't be w-wasting my time.

NANCY
I guess I didn't realize I was a waste
of time.

JIMMY
Oh Jeez!  Are you gonna start running
your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push
it!!

NANCY
Jimmy, everyone's worried about you.
You seem... different.

JIMMY
Theh-they're all just ..jealous.

NANCY
You're not the boy I fell in love with
last week during Free Period. I'm leaving
you.

JIMMY
You're not leaving me! You try to leave
me and I'll kill you, bitch!

NANCY
You can't treat people like this!

JIMMY
I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why
did you make me do it, huh?!  You're
not leavin' anybody!! You just keep
your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what
you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!

MOM
What the?  Jimmy, oh my God!

JIMMY
Stay away from me, you stupid bbbbitches!
No! God!

[Saturday morning at the Special Olympics stadium]

HOST
Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special
Olympics!  We will be holding various
throughout the day, and at the end of
it all we will have some very special
celebrity athletes here to present the
trophy for top athlete, along with the
cash prize of one thousand dollars.


JIMMY
Top athlete, yeah!

CARTMAN
One thousand dollars, yeah!

HOST
So let's have all our athletes report
to their first assigned events and...
Let the Games begin!

[First event, Track and Field, 100-meter dash]

ANNOUNCER
Will those athletes in heat 1 of the
hundred-meter dash please report to
Track Aread B.

VOLUNTEER 2
Okay, racers, are we ready?  Take your
marks.

CARTMAN
Daaaa! Daaaa!

VOLUNTEER 2
On your marks! Get set! Go!

CARTMAN
Whoa. What the hell??

VOLUNTEER 2
Great job, everyone.  You three advance
to the next heat.

WINNER
All right!

BLOND BOY
Good Job.

BLONDE GIRL
We did it!

CARTMAN
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have
to kick ass in the other events.

["Put It To The Limit" begins to play again. Cartman is in a
swimming competition now, but again,he's struggling in last place.
Jimmy lifts a bar laden with weights successfully in the clean-and-jerk
competition, then throws the bar down]

JIMMY
Yeeessss!  Yes! Yes!

ANNOUNCER
He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics
record, folks!

[Back to Track and Field events, 100-meter hurdles. Cartman is
again last]

CARTMAN
God-damnit!!

[Back to Swimming events. Jimmy takes his heat easily]

ANNOUNCER
Winner, Jimmy Valmer!

[Track and Field events, pole-vault. a Special Olympian runs
up to the posts, plants his pole in the square mark, and clears
the bar successfully. Cartman steps up to the straight track
with his pole]

CARTMAN
All right, this one I can win!  Here,
hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned
retards!

[Track and Field events, 100-meter hurdles. Jimmy increases his
lead over the competition]

[Track and Field events, javelin throw. An athlete runs up to
the edge and throws his javelin. His tongue hangs out. Jimmy
rolls up and throws his javelin. Cartman runs up and throws his,
but it lands just far enough for him to still touch the tail
end of it]

CARTMAN
God-damnit!!

[Track and Field events, triple jump. Jimmy jumps and lands at
18.5 feet, skids a foot more, then stops and waits for the score]


ANNOUNCER
That's another Special Olympics record!


JIMMY
Yeah! Yeah!  Yeah, I did it!  Yeah!
Yeah!

[Early evening at the Special Olympics stadium. The sun has set
and some of the crowd is back on the field]

HOST
Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition
has come to an end, and we have an ultimate
grand special champion for 2004! Here
to present the award are baseball legends
Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry
Bonds.

BONDS
The two thousand and four special athlete
is... Jimmy Valmer.

JIMMY
Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm
the bbub-best!

HOST
Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know
that the Special Olympics isn't just
about winning. And so, we will now give
out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped
person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!


CARTMAN
Ah, screw you hippie!

HOST
For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will
receive this gift certificate to Shakey's
for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!


CARTMAN
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.
Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!

JIMMY
Hey! Just what the hell do you think
you're doing, Eric?!

CARTMAN
Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.

JIMMY
You ffffaked being handicapped to win?!
I should k-kick your ass right here,
you lousy no-good ch-ch-ch...cheater!


TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
What?

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Oh my God. You, you're right, Timmy.
You're totally right.  Everyone, can
I have your attention, please?  I'm
afraid I have to give back my medal.
The truth is, I haven't been playing
fair either. I've been using st-steroids.
I was willing to do anything to be the
best, and the steroids made me blind
to the people I was hurting.  A good
friend even tried to talk me out of
it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking
steroids is just like pretending to
be handicapped at the Special Olympics.
Because you're taking all the fairness
out of the game. But I know now that
even if you do win on steroids, you're
really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy.
You're just a  big fat p-p...p...pussy,
and if you take steroids, the only decent
thing to do is come forward and say,
"Remove me from the record books, because
I am a big, stinky p-pussy-"  "-steroid-taking
jackass."  That's how I feel about myself,
and why I must decline this medal and
my place in the history books. And if
you'll let me, I'll be back next year.
To compete with honor.

MCGUIRE
Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.


[The stands. Cartman walks up to his friends]

CARTMAN
Well guys, I guess now you see what
I was up to all along. I dressed up
like a handicapped person and lost the
Special Olympics on purpose, so that
Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.
Eh, oh yeah?! Well, well you guys are
assholes!  Grow up!

Episode 111

"Tom's Rhinoplasty"

by

Trey Parker



ACT I

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

WENDY
Stan, you know it's almost Valentines
day...

STAN
I know.

WENDY
Maybe we should go on a cruise or
something.

STAN
I can't afford a cruise, dude!

WENDY
(Sweet)
I know, but we could make a little
boat out of cardboard, and pretend
it's a cruise!

Cartman hears this and just starts laughing his ass off.

STAN
Shut up Cartman!

CARTMAN
HOO, HOO! OHH THAT IS SO LAME HA HA
HOO HOO!

WENDY
And then we could dress up in little
costumes and pretend like we're
getting married.

Cartman hears this and just starts laughing his ass off again.

CARTMAN
Stop, seriously. You're killing me
over here.

Principal Victoria steps in front of the class.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Children, I have some difficult news
for you... Mr. Garrison won't be
teaching for a while. He has to have
surgery.

The kids all cheer.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
So you're going to have a substitute
teacher. And I want you to show the
substitute the SAME respect you show
for Mr. Garrison... Yes, little boy?

KYLE
(Flatly)
We don't have respect for Mr.
Garrison.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh.

The kids just sit there.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Anyhoo, I want you all to meet your
new substitute... Ms. Ellen.

MS. ELLEN walks in, she is beautiful and classy.

MS. ELLEN
Hello, children.

STAN AND KYLE
Woa...

CARTMAN
Wow, she's PRETTY!!

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph!!

STAN
You can say that again!

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Good Luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get
out of control just use this tear
gas, okay?

Principal Victoria drops a can of tear gas on the desk and
walks out.

MS. ELLEN
Thank you, I'm sure I'll be fine.

The boys stare, enthralled with the beautiful teacher.

MS. ELLEN
Now, children, I know that you must
be very upset about your teacher
having surgery... But I promise I'll
try to make things as easy as possible
for all of us.

Stan, Cartman, Kyle and Kenny all have little hearts above
their heads and big smiles on their faces.

Wendy notices Stan's expression, and starts to get worried.

WENDY
Stan? Stan?

Stan is just focused on the teacher.

MS. ELLEN
Now, let me try and learn your names
by your seating assignments.
(Reading off of paper)
You are... Eric Cartman?

CARTMAN
Yes ma'am!

MS. ELLEN
Okay... And
(Turning to Stan)
YOU must be Stan Marsh!

Stan vomits all over his desk.

Wendy's eyes grow huge, she can't believe it.

MS. ELLEN
Do you need to go to the nurse's
office, Stanly?

CARTMAN
No, he always pukes when he's in
love.

STAN
I'll kick your ass, Cartman!!

MS. ELLEN
So you're alright?

Stan pukes.

KYLE
(Pointing)
Dude, you had waffles for breakfast,
huh!!

Wendy looks really sad.

INT. TOM'S RHINOPLASTY - DAY

Tom the Rhinoplast and Mr. Garrison sit in front of a large
computer screen.

MR. GARRISON
I have to admit I'm still embarrassed
about getting a nose job, Tom. I
didn't want people at school to know,
so I told them I had herpes.

TOM
You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr.
Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery
all the time.

Tom turns on the computer.

TOM
Before we start the surgery, this
computer can help you pick what kind
of nose you want.

MR. GARRISON
Wow, isn't that amazing, Mr. Hat?

MR. HAT
It sure is, Mr. Garrison.

Tom hits a few keys on the keyboard. An image of Mr. Garrison
comes up on the screen.

TOM
Now, we could go with something a
little smaller, which would make you
look like... This.

The computer image morphs, the little line of Garrison's
nose gets a little smaller.

MR. GARRISON
Hmm...

TOM
Or, we could straighten out the
bridge, which would make you look
like this...

Again the image changes slightly.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, that's not bad...

TOM
Of course we could narrow the bridge,
which would make you look more like --
This...

The image of Mr. Garrison morphs into a full color head shot
of David Hasslehoff.

MR. GARRISON
WOW!!! THAT'S IT!! THAT'S THE NOSE I
WANT!!

TOM
Alrighty then.

Tom turns off the computer and takes a few notes.

TOM
Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison,
that there ARE risks...

Ominous MUSIC swells up.

TOM
You could wind up a hideous, foul,
shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly
ugly that you are forced to live in
the sewers, only emerging at night
to hunt for scraps of food.

Garrison thinks.

MR. GARRISON
I can live with that.

TOM
Alrighty then, let's get started!

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

The boys are all gathered on the playground.

CARTMAN
She wasn't looking at you, buttLord!
She was looking at ME.

KYLE
Well that goes without saying, Fat
ass -- How could she HELP but look
at you!!

STAN
You guys can stop fighting, it was
ME she was checking out.

CARTMAN
Until you puked on her.

Chef walks up.

CHEF
Hello there, children. What's all
this I'm hearing about a new teacher?

KYLE
Ms. Ellen, dude! She's BEAUTIFUL!

Wendy is sitting on the swingset next to her friend Bebe.
Bebe looks at Wendy who is hearing all of this and looking
pitiful.

CHEF
Is she like, Vanessa Williams
beautiful or Toni Braxton Beautiful?

The boys think.

CHEF
Or Pamela Anderson beautiful?

The boys don't know.

CHEF
Or is she Erin Grey in the second
season of Buck Rodgers beautiful?

STAN
Yeah, that one!

CHEF
WWOOH!!! I gotta meet this woman!!

Finally, Wendy walks up.

WENDY
Stan, Didn't you notice how her left
arm is longer than the right one?

STAN
No.

WENDY
Well it is!

CHEF
That's okay. You know what they say
about women with one arm longer than
the other...

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmph!!

CHEF
That's right!

The boys all laugh merrily.

WENDY
Well did you notice that mole on the
back of her neck with the hair growing
out of it?

Everybody thinks.

CHEF
That's okay, you know what they say
about women with a mole on the back
of their necks with hair growing out
of it...

Pause...

Kenny looks at Chef, confused.

WENDY
Stan, we're still valentines, right?

STAN
Sure, Wendy, whatever.

The boys walk away AD LIBBING lines about Ms. Ellen (She is
so pretty) etc.

KYLE
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen
Valentine's day presents!

STAN
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!

CARTMAN
I'm going to buy a vacuum cleaner.
Chicks love vacuum cleaners.

Wendy looks like she's about to cry as SAD MUSIC swells up.
TRACK in on Wendy's sad little face as the song begins:

SONG
I remember when we were so in
love.........

As the SONG CONTINUES, we see a montage of Stan and Wendy
together:

From Ep.1: Stan Barfs in the cafeteria.
From Ep.1: Stan's Barfs at Stark's Pond.
From Ep.7: Stan Barfs in the cemetery.
From Ep.1: Stan barfs in Wendy's face.

SONG
The moments that we shared were
timeless...

The song ends, and poor little Wendy walks away, sniffling.

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The children are back in their desks.

MS. ELLEN
Oh, goodness. Would anybody mind
cleaning my erasers after class?

The boys all shoot their hands up.

CARTMAN
ME! ME! ME!

Bebe Notices Wendy's pitiful expression.

BEBE
You guys are so immature! Act like
eight year olds!

MS. ELLEN
Stan, how about you?

Stan vomits.

STAN
I'd love to!

Wendy looks ready to kill.

MS. ELLEN
Now, children, let's review our
multiplication tables.

Cartman raises his hand.

MS. ELLEN
Cartman?

CARTMAN
What's a multiplication table?

MS. ELLEN
Didn't Mr. Garrison teach
multiplication?

The kids all shake their heads.

MS. ELLEN
Well, where did he leave off?

CARTMAN
We were learning about how Yasmine
Bleeth was going out with that Richard
Greico guy that used to be on "21
Jump Street", but then he got his
own show for just a little while.

Chef walks in unannounced.

CHEF
Oh, hello!

MS. ELLEN
Can I help you?

CHEF
(Suavely)
I'm Chef...

MS. ELLEN
And?

CHEF
I just, uh... I stopped by 'cause
little Kyle forgot his laundry
detergent on the playground.

Chef holds out a box of Whoosh Laundry Detergent.

KYLE
My laundry detergent?

STAN
That's not Kyle's lau-

CHEF
Shh!

Chef puts the detergent on Kyle's desk.

CHEF
Crazy crackers are always leaving
their detergent all over the place.
What was your name again?

CARTMAN
(Aside, to Kyle)
Oh, oh, Chef's movin' in on Ms. Ellen!

MS. ELLEN
I'm the substitute.

CHEF
Well, I'm sure there's no substitute
for you.

MS. ELLEN
That's very nice, Mr. Chef. Now if
you're finished-

MUSIC kicks in.

CHEF
(Singing)
Nobody could take your place No way
they could match your face 'no, you
got it goin on in a way so clear...
I just wanna buy you a beer-or maybe
tonight at seven thirty or something
I could come by and pick you up in
my car... (No Substitute) No
substitute for you, (No substitute)
No baby there's... (No substitute)
for you girl (No substitute) for you
now. You know that it's true, (No
substitute) There's just no substitute
for you.

As abruptly as it started, the song ends.

STAN
We have GOT to learn how to do this,
dude.

KYLE
Yup.

MS. ELLEN
That was enthralling, Mr. Chef. But,
could I get back to teaching now?

CHEF
If we can have dinner tonight.

MS. ELLEN
Fine, Chef, just let me do my job
before I get fired.

CARTMAN
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet
love to Ms. Ellen!

MS. ELLEN
WHAT?!

EXT. TOM'S RHINOPLASTY - DAY

Establish.

INT. TOM'S RHINOPLASTY - DAY

We see Tom the Rhinoplast from the camera's P.O.V. Tom is
splattered with blood.

TOM
Mr. Garrison? Mr. Garrison?

The camera JIGGLES a little.

MR. GARRISON (O.S.)
Where... Where am I?

*Note -- Garrison's voice should be EXTREMELY plugged up,
like he has a terrible cold.

TOM
The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, I feel... Weak... How do I look?

Now we see Mr. Garrison. His face is completely wrapped with
bandages and blood is smeared all over it. He looks like
shit.

TOM
You look great.

MR. GARRISON
I feel kind of nauseous...

TOM
Yes, well, that's to be expected. We
did some major reconstruction. Sawed
through some bone... snapped some
cartilage.

MR. GARRISON
(He's gonna puke)
wuhh...

TOM
All the blood and mucus... Just the
sound of bone and sinew coming
apart... KKKKGH!!

MR. GARRISON
wughhhh...

TOM
By the way... Did you ever see that
movie 'Contact'?

Now Garrison completely loses it. He bends over and vomits
through his bandages onto the floor.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, stop! That movie was terrible!!

TOM
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why
don't you get some rest? I'll check
on you a little later...

Tom walks out.

MR. GARRISON
(Weakly)
Waited through that entire movie to
see the alien and it was her goddamn
father...

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The school bell rings and the kids all start filing out.

MS. ELLEN
Okay, kids remember your homework.
We have a lot of catching up to do!

CARTMAN
Goodbye, Ms. Ellen!

KYLE
Stop kissing ass, Cartman!

CARTMAN
I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!

The boys all say goodbye on their way out. Finally, only
little Wendy is left.

WENDY
Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?

MS. ELLEN
Of course, Wendy.

Wendy sits down in the little chair next to the desk.

WENDY
I couldn't help but notice you taking
a liking to my boyfriend Stan.

MS. ELLEN
(Laughing a little)
Oh... Well I've taken a liking to
ALL of you! You're all so young and
cute and full of life!

WENDY
Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?

MS. ELLEN
Of course, Wendy.

Wendy moves her face in towards Ms. Ellen so that they are
almost eye to eye.

WENDY
Don't. Fuck. With. Me.

MS. ELLEN
What?

WENDY
You heard me, stay away from my man,
bitch, or I'll whup you're sorry Ho
ass back to last year.

With that, Wendy hops down off the chair and heads out the
door.

WENDY
Bye, Ms. Ellen!

Wendy leaves. Ms. Ellen just sits there with her jaw wide
open.

ACT II

FIRST COMMERCIAL BREAK

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Ms. Ellen is sitting at her desk, surrounded by gift wrapped
boxes.

MS. ELLEN
Well, I certainly want to thank you
all you lovely children for the
presents you bought me...

Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny all glow.

MS. ELLEN
(Opening the box)
Oh! What a delightful scarf! Thank
you, Kyle!

Kyle gives a snooty look to other boys, who scowl back at
him.

STAN
(Coughing)
Loser-gift. Loser-gift.

MS. ELLEN
(Opening another)
And here's one from Kenny... Oh,
thank you very much, Kenny, this is
a very scrumtious looking sausage.

Kenny laughs, HARD.

MS. ELLEN
(Opening another)
Oh, and what a nice alarm clock!
Thank you Stan!

Stan vomits. Wendy fumes.

MS. ELLEN
And here's another present... From
Wendy!

She opens the present.

MS. ELLEN
Oh, why it's a dead animal. Thank
you Wendy!

Wendy fumes some more. Ms. Ellen puts the dead carcass under
her desk.

STAN
See? She liked my present the best!

KYLE
Where's your present Cartman?

CARTMAN
Oh well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate
pie, but I left it at home.

MS. ELLEN
Okay, kids, we're going to take a
spelling test now.

The kids all moan.

MS. ELLEN
But, as an extra incentive, I'm gonna
take whoever gets the highest score
on the quiz out to dinner!

The boys faces all light up.

CARTMAN
Oh, man! I wish I knew how to spell!!

MS. ELLEN
Are there any questions before we
begin? ...Yes, Wendy?

WENDY
When someone gets as old as you, do
they have to wear Depends under
garments?

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The boys are in line for lunch.

KYLE
Dude, I ACED that test! I'm gonna
win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!

STAN
No you're not, I don't think I missed
any!

Wendy walks up holding her lunch tray.

WENDY
Hi, Stan.

STAN
I bet I scored a hundred!

WENDY
(YELLING)
HI, STAN!!

STAN
Oh, hi Wendy.

WENDY
I was just in the bathroom, and Ms.
Ellen was in there taking the biggest
dump I've ever seen.

KYLE
No she wasn't!

WENDY
Yes she was!

STAN
That's impossible.

WENDY
Well, she did, and she has horrible,
horrible gas, too. She says she can't
control it.

CARTMAN
Nu-uh.

WENDY
It smelled like a dead calf rotting
in the hot sun.

KYLE
Oh Cool!

CARTMAN
Alright, Wendy, seriously, you need
to stop with this whole jealousy
thing.

KYLE
Yeah, you're acting like a freak,
Wendy.

WENDY
(Like a freak)
NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREAK!

Wendy walks away, pissed.

CARTMAN
Oh man, someone's got to pull that
monkey out of Wendy's ass.

The boys walk into the kitchen.

CHEF
(Sad)
Hello there, children.

CARTMAN
Oh hey, Chef.

KYLE
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?

CHEF
Not too good.

Chef looks almost ready to cry.

STAN
What happened? Didn't you make sweet
love to her?

CHEF
No, no! She's not like that. You
see... How do I put this... Children,
Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for
the right team.

The boys look confused.

CHEF
In other words, children... She's
not a member of the heterosexual
persuasion.

The boys look more confused.

CHEF
Don't you understand? She's a lesbian!

STAN
A what-bian?

KYLE
A plebeian?

CHEF
You boys don't know what a lesbian
is?

The boys turn to Kenny.

STAN
Kenny?

Kenny thinks long and hard, and finally just shrugs.

STAN
No. Explain it to us, Chef.

CHEF
Uhh, that's okay. Uhh... Look, all
you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a
lesbian, and that means she only
likes OTHER lesbians.

STAN
Oh.

CHEF
Now, move along, children. You're
holding up the line.

The boys take their trays and head out.

KYLE
Weak, dude. She only likes other
lesbians?

STAN
Hey, man, if she only likes other
lesbians, then all we gotta do is
become lesbians too!

KYLE
Hey, Yeah!

The boys all head offscreen.

CARTMAN
You guys, you know what? My grandma
was Dutch-Irish and my grandpa was
lesbian! That makes me quarter
lesbian!

STAN
You're just saying that Cartman!!

KYLE
Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat ass!

CARTMAN
I am TOO!!

INT. TOM'S RHINOPLASTY - DAY

TOM
Okay, only a few more bandages to
go...

Tom unwinds the last of the bandages.

MR. GARRISON
Well?

TOM
Take a look for yourself.

Tom hands Garrison a mirror, as soon as the mirror comes up,
we TRACK AROUND to a front view of Garrison.

His face looks EXACTLY like David Hasslehoff. In fact, it IS
David Hasslehoff. A color photo cut out slapped on Garrison's
body.

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
Wow! That's a pretty good nose job!
What do you think, Mr. Hat?

MR. HAT
I think it looks great!

TOM
Yes, I think once the swelling goes
down you'll really notice a
difference.

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The boys walk in to find Cartman down on all fours with his
face to the floor.

STAN
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?

Cartman sits up.

CARTMAN
My mom said if you want to become a
lesbian you have to lick carpet.

KYLE
Really?

STAN
Well I got a Indiglo girls CD. The
guy at the record store said it was
perfect.

Stan puts the CD in a CD player.

KYLE
And I got these killer Berkenstocks.

Kyle puts on the shoes.

The boys all get down on their hands and knees and start
licking the carpet as the Indigo girls play in the background.

CARTMAN
This is a bunch of crap! I've been
licking this carpet for THREE HOURS
and I still don't feel like a lesbian!

EXT. SOUTH PARK MALL - DAY

The song SHADOW DANCIN' by Andy Gibb starts up as we follow
Mr. Garrison's feet walking down the street a la Travolta.

The camera PANS UP to reveal Mr. Garrison (still with is
Hasslehoff head, of course) walking proudly.

He passes an attractive forty-something woman, Mrs. Kimble.

MR. GARRISON
Hi, Mrs. Kimble.

MRS. KIMBLE
(hot for him)
Oh, howdy, Mr. Garrison. Say honey,
you look kinda different...

MR. GARRISON
Really?

MRS. KIMBLE
Did you get a haircut?

MR. GARRISON
No, but thanks for asking.

Garrison struts on down the street as the song continues,
with a big smile on his face.

MRS. KIMBLE
Call me! I'm in the book!

MR. GARRISON
Wow, Mr. Hat... Having a nose job is
even better than I thought! There's
a whole WORLD of opportunity opening
up in front of us!

EXT. WENDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It looks like every other house in South Park.

INT. WENDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Wendy answers her door.

WENDY
Thanks for coming over, Bebe.

BEBE
That's okay, Wendy. I brought my
make-up kit like you asked me. What
are we doing, anyway?

WENDY
That mean ol' substitute isn't going
to stop until she takes everything
from me, Bebe.

BEBE
Really?

WENDY
Yeah. What I'd really like to do is
load her into a rocket and have her
shot into the center of the sun.

Bebe's eyes get big.

WENDY
But instead, I'll just get Stan to
notice ME again. Bebe, I need a
MAKEOVER!

BEBE
Oh, cool!

EXT. SOUTH PARK - MORNING

It's day again in South Park.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The boys are settling into their desks.

STAN
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see
what a raging lesbian I am!

CARTMAN
I'm a bigger lesbian than you!

STAN
No, you're a FATTER lesbian than me.

KYLE
Screw you guys, I'm KING lesbian!!

Suddenly, all the children GASP.

CLYDE
WOA!!! Is that Wendy Testaburger?!

The boys all turn their heads to the door, where Wendy has
just walked in.

She is dressed all in black leather, with her hair frizzled
out like Olivia Newton John in 'Grease'.

'Grease' type music plays as Wendy makes her way across the
classroom.

WENDY
(Bitchy and cool)
Hi guys, What's up?

CARTMAN
Wow... Wendy looks just like that
chick from grease, Elton John.

STAN
Wow.

Wendy sits down.

STAN
Hi, Wendy.

WENDY
Oh, hi Stan.

Wendy leans over and whispers to Bebe.

WENDY
I think it worked, Bebe!

BEBE
Yeah!

MS. ELLEN
Good morning children!

The camera WHIP PANS over to Ms. Ellen, who happens to be
wearing black leather pants and a stylish black leather
jacket.

STAN
WWOOOWW!!!!

'Grease' style music plays as Ms. Ellen walks over to the
chalkboard.

CARTMAN
Damn! Get down!

STAN
Yeah!

Wendy and Bebe just sit there open mouthed.

MS. ELLEN
Oh, Wendy, you wore black leather,
too!

Wendy can't speak.

MS. ELLEN
We're like sisters!!

WENDY
DIE!!!!

MS. ELLEN
Alright, kids, I've finished grading
your papers, and the person with the
highest score is...

Just then, the Garrison-Hasslehoff thing walks into the room.

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
Hello there, children!

STAN
Oh no, Mr. Garrison's back!

CARTMAN
Oh, weak, dude.

Wendy, however is absolutely ecstatic. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays
as the camera ZOOMS IN on her happy, happy face.

WENDY
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr.
Garrison!

Wendy does some cartwheels as happy MUSIC kicks in.

WENDY
(Singing)
He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison
is back!

She cartwheels up to Ms. Ellen.

WENDY
So long, SUBSTITUTE! Don't let the
door hit your ass on the way out
now!

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
Children, I have a very important
announcement to make...

Wendy calms down.

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
I'm quitting my job as a teacher.

SCREECH!! The music comes to a halt.

WENDY
WHAT?!

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
It's strange, but suddenly I feel
really confident about myself, and
I've decided to quit teaching and do
what I've always dreamed of doing...
Hang out and screw hot chicks.

The kids are all stunned.

WENDY
You... You can't!

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
But the good new is, I've already
talked to principal Victoria about
it, and Ms. Ellen can stay on as
your PERMANENT teacher!!

The kids all CHEER.

MS. ELLEN
Really?

Principal Victoria walks in.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
That's right, will you stay?

MS. ELLEN
Well, SURE!

WENDY
(Screaming at the top
of her lungs)
NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

MS. ELLEN
Oh, by the way kids, the person who
scored highest on the quiz and gets
to have dinner on me is... STAN!!

Stan vomits.

STAN
Kick ass!

WENDY
NOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOO!!!!!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, and Wendy I almost forgot. We
just got a call in the office, your
grandma just died.

WENDY
AAAAAGGHHGHGHGH!!!!!!! AAGAHGAH!!!
AGHAGAHGAH!!!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh my! What an exciting day!!

ACT III

SECOND COMMERCIAL BREAK

INT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY

Garrison, with his Hasslehoff head, is posing for a
photographer. Behind him is a white sheet, and lights are on
either side. Garrison has his shirt unbuttoned.

Funky MUSIC jams as the photographer rolls off shots.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Great, baby! You're looking great!

MR. GARRISON
I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat!

MR. HAT
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!

PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, just a few hundred more shots
and we'll be done.

MR. GARRISON
A few HUNDRED?

PHOTOGRAPHER
Hey, that's the life of a model,
baby.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, boy, I'm gonna need some more
smack.

PHOTOGRAPHER
You got it.

The music starts up again and Garrison goes back to posing.

EXT. ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET - NIGHT

Establishing.

INT. ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET - NIGHT

Stan and Ellen are at a table eating and laughing.

MS. ELLEN
I'm very glad we could have dinner
together, Stanly. I want you to know
that I really care about your
education.

Stan looks like he's gonna puke, but holds it down.

STAN
Are we making love?

Silence...

MS. ELLEN
Excuse me?

STAN
They don't have a fireplace here, we
shouldn't be making love yet.

MS. ELLEN
What are you talking about?

STAN
You have to make love down by the
fire. That's what Chef always says.

MS. ELLEN
Stan, I'm your TEACHER. Okay? We're
only FRIENDS.

STAN
But why?

MS. ELLEN
Well, first of all, you're eight.

STAN
It's because I'm not a lesbian isn't
it!

MS. ELLEN
Oh, boy...

EXT. ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET - NIGHT

Over somebody's shoulder, we can see into the lit up window
of the restaurant, where Ms. Ellen and Stan are talking.

It's Wendy. She's looking in from outside in the rain.

Like a scene from a movie, she just stands there, with a
demented look on her rain soaked face -- The light from the
neon sign flickering slowly.

WENDY
It's over... I give up.

Wendy lowers her sad little head, and walks away, as sad
PIANO MUSIC plays.

EXT. AVENUE DE LOS MEXICANOS - DAY

Garrison is walking down the street slowly.

GARRISON
Boy, I'll tell you something Mr.
Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a
while, but it sure does get boring.

MR. HAT
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!

Just then, Garrison hears a growing sound. Women screaming...

Garrison looks over and sees about fifteen South Park women
all charging towards him with love in their eyes. They all
ad lib ('ooh, there he is' and 'It's him! It's Mr. Garrison!')

GARRISON
What the...

The charging, screaming women surround Garrison, and like
crazed Elvis fans start kissing him and tearing off his
clothes.

GARRISON
Hey wait, wait, wait....AGHAGAH!!!
Mr. Hat save yourself.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The boys are taking their seats.

KYLE
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen
go?

CARTMAN
Did you make love?

STAN
I think so!

CARTMAN
No way!

STAN
Yup.

KYLE
Down by the fire?

STAN
Yup.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmph rm rmphm
rm?

STAN
Did I WHAT?!

Ms. Ellen walks in. Stan immediately sits upright in his
seat and quiets down.

MS. ELLEN
Good morning, children.

Wendy walks up to Ms. Ellen's desk.

WENDY
Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?

MS. ELLEN
Sure, but can it wait until after
class, Wendy?

WENDY
No. I just have to apologize for the
way I've been acting.

MS. ELLEN
Oh, that's okay, Wendy.

WENDY
No, it's not. Since you're here to
stay, I just hope we can be friends.

MS. ELLEN
Well I would LOVE that, Wendy.

Now Wendy turns to the entire class.

WENDY
And I want to apologize to everybody.
The way I acted was wrong, and I've
learned from it. I just wish Stan
and Ms. Ellen would have all the
happiness in the world.

Now Stan actually looks kind of sad.

MS. ELLEN
Wendy, there's NOTHING between me
and Stan!

CARTMAN
That's not what we just heard!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK SOMEWHERE

Garrison-Hasslehoff stops running and tries to catch his
breath. His clothes are torn to shreds.

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
Oh, Mr. Hat... I hate this, I wish
I'd never had a nose job!!

In the distance, the SCREAMING WOMEN can be heard.

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
Damn this beautiful face of mine!!
Damn it to hell!!

The screaming women round the corner. Garrison has to take
off running again.

MR. GARRISON-HASSLEHOFF
We have to go get surgery again, Mr.
Hat!! I want to be the old me again!!

The screaming women chase Garrison through town.

Garrison runs into Tom's Rhinoplasty. The screaming women
run by.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

MS. ELLEN
Okay, children, let's catch up on
our cursive handwriting.

Wendy is slouched over her desk, looking sad and miserable.

Suddenly LOUD COMMOTION is heard and 8 fatigue wearing Iraqi
soldiers BURST into the room!

IRAQI
DOWN! DOWN! EVERYBODY DOWN!!

CARTMAN
What the hell?!

The kids all get under their desks. The soldiers take over
the room.

IRAQI
So, we meet again, Ms. Ellen!!

Ms. Ellen looks confused.

Principal Victoria comes running in.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And just what is going on here,
mister?

IRAQI
I am Hakeem Korashki of the mighty
nation of Iraq! This woman is a
traitor to our government!

Ms. Ellen stands behind her desk.

MS. ELLEN
It's a lie!

IRAQI
She has killed thousands, and will
kill again I assure you!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ms. Ellen is this true?

MS. ELLEN
NO!

IRAQI
We must take her back to Iraq
immediately!

WENDY
OH, COOL!!!

MS. ELLEN
Principal Victoria, please!

IRAQI
Here is a black and white photo of
Ms. Ellen with our leader-

A black and white photo of Ms. Ellen and Sadaam Hussein.

IRAQI
Her REAL name is Makesh Alak
Makarakesh!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, Ms. Makarakesh, you certainly
tried to put one over on US, boy
howdy!! Take her away!

The soldiers run toward Ms. Ellen. But Ms. Ellen grabs one
of their swords and it slips out of her hand.

The sword flies throughout the air and hits Kenny between
the eyes pining him to the wall.

STAN
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastard!!

Ms. Ellen can't believe it either. The soldiers grab Ms.
Ellen by the arms and lead her out.

MS. ELLEN
NO!! NOOO!!!

WENDY
Wow! What incredible irony!

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and helicopters swarm
the little school.

Stan and Wendy stand amongst the horde of onlookers.

STAN
Wow... I can't believe Ms. Ellen was
a criminal Iraqi fugitive...

WENDY
Yeah, you just never know.

STAN
Well, I guess...I'm sorry that I was
ignoring you and stuff.

Wendy smiles.

WENDY
Happy Valentines Day, Stan.

Wendy puckers. Stan looks a little scared, but then moves
his mouth towards hers...

Both kids open their mouths slightly...

Stan vomits into Wendy's open mouth.

WENDY
EW!!!

STAN
Sorry.

WENDY
No, it's okay Stan! Everything's
going to be okay!

KYLE
Cartman, are you still trying to
become a lesbian?

CARTMAN
Yeah dude, my mom says all I have to
do is chow on this box.

THIRD COMMERCIAL BREAK

EXT. IRAQ

Ms. Ellen is being escorted into what appears to be a large
missile.

IRAQI
For crimes against this country, you
are hereby sentenced to be shot into
the center of the sun.

MS. ELLEN
(Struggling)
THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE!! THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING!!

Ms. Ellen is thrown in the missile and the large door is
closed. We can see her through one of the windows, banging
on it.

MS. ELLEN
(Muffled)
PLEASE!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!

IRAQI
SHAVA!!!

Another Iraqi hits a switch-

-and the missile blasts off into the sky. FWWWOOOMMM!!!!

EXT. WENDY'S HOUSE - DAY

Establishing.

EXT. WENDY'S BACK YARD

Wendy has a little pool in her backyard, where she is having
a medium sized party.

Adults are CHATTERING and drinking as Wendy sits in a small
little lounger next to Bebe. Both of them have frozen drinks
and sunglasses on.

Several Women walk over to Wendy with their cocktails, oddly
enough, they are the women who were chasing Garrison.

MRS. KIMBLE
Great Party, Wendy.

WENDY
Thanks, Mrs. Kimble, thanks for
helping me get Mr. Garrison to come
back as a teacher.

MRS. KIMBLE
Anything for you, sugarpie.

Kyle walks up.

WENDY
Oh, hi, Kyle.

KYLE
I've been thinking, Wendy... This
whole outcome is pretty strange...

WENDY
Uh-huh, excuse me.

Wendy to turns to a bunch of Iraqi's who are waiting in line.

WENDY
Ga pharat ket latn blak.

IRAQI
Koorat de latn blak.

WENDY
Latn korat de pharat ket latn blak.

IRAQI
Laken blak ba la laken.

WENDY
Kraken blak la blaken lak

IRAQI
Iraken blak laken pharat.

The Iraqis walk away, pleased.

KYLE
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly
arrested for...

WENDY
Wait, wait!! Shh!! It's time to whip
out the eclipse shoe boxes!

Wendy holds up a shoebox to her eye.

ANGLE - SHOEBOX

We see the tiniest little splotz hit the sun and immediately
get engulfed.

RESUME - WENDY

WENDY
Bye, bye, Ms. Ellen.

KYLE
Wendy, you didn't!

Wendy says nothing. She just starts laughing.

Kyle's eyes grow wide as Wendy's laugh turns completely
insane.

WENDY
I told her! Don't fuck with Wendy
Testaburger!!

Episode 606


"PROFESSOR CHAOS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Cartman's room, day. Cartman and Kyle stand inside watchng Stan,
who is peeking out the door, waiting for someone]

STAN
Okay, here he comes.

KYLE
Who wants to tell him?

CARTMAN
I'll do it.

BUTTERS
Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called
me. There was a pie-eating contest down
at the firehouse, and I thought we should
all go.

CARTMAN
Butters, could you take a seat, please?


BUTTERS
Wuh well, sure.

CARTMAN
Butters, we have to have a very difficult
conversation.

BUTTERS
Wull what is it?

CARTMAN
Well, in the, in the months since our
friend Kenny died, you've really stepped
up as a friend and "filled the gap."


BUTTERS
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein'
you guys' new friend.

CARTMAN
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working
out.

BUTTERS
Nnnot working out?

CARTMAN
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you
go, as our friend. You're just tooo...


KYLE
Lame

CARTMAN
Lane, yes.

BUTTERS
Well, but ah I can get better.

STAN
Butters, you just don't really fit in
with us here. We think it's best for
all of us if you for friendship opportunites
elsewhere.

KYLE
But we certainly want to thank you for
all your hard work and attempts at being
our friend, lame as they were.

BUTTERS
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin'
along... great. Heh ah I thought we
were really havin' fun together.

CARTMAN
Yes, well, we weren't.

BUTTERS
Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.

KYLE
We're sorry Butters.  Our mind is made
up.

CARTMAN
But we certainly wanna thank you for
coming by.  You know the way out, right?


KYLE
Phew.

STAN, CARTMAN
Phew.

KYLE
Hm, I think he took that pretty well,
I think.

CARTMAN
Who cares?

STAN
All right, so let's get started on who's
gonna be the new person to take Kenny's
place.

[Butters' house, night. A thunderstorm hovers over the neighborhood.
Inside Butters' room a hamster set is seen, and beyond, Butters
standing on his bed, looking out his window. He has an angry
expression on his face]

BUTTERS
The world isn't fair. I do everything
people ask me to. I stand in the lunch
line for them, I buy tampons at the
store for them, I go on Maury Povich
with balls on my chin for them.  And
yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast.
A shadow of a man who can find no companion...
ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If
I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm
through doin' what others tell me to
do, and I am sick of this world and
the stin-, and the stinky people in
it!  From now on I will dedicate my
life to bringing chaos to the world
that has rejected me!  I will become
the greatest supervillain  the world
has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction
will follow!

[Butters goes about making a suit for himself. He begins with
a sheet of aluminum foil and shapes it around a styrofoam head
to make a helmet. He pulls out a shirt from the closet and makes
it a cape using a sewing machine. Pretty soon, he's finished
- he's dressed as something of a knight]

BUTTERS
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for
the greatest supervillain you've ever
seen! Professor Chaos!

LINDA
Butters, time for bed.

BUTTERS
Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep
for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins.


[South Park, morning. A small stage is shown in Cartman'ss backyard,
with a camera off to the side. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up
on stage and look out over the backyard]

CARTMAN
All right, we wanna thank everybody
for coming. This is a great turnout.
Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died
a few months ago and we are still looking
to fill the void with a new friend.
Now, you've all been selected as possible
candidates, but unfortunately, there
is only room for one of you. So Stan
and Kyle and I will be spending the
next few days going out with each one
of you and narrowing our choices down.
Until we think we've found the perfect
friend. Are there any questions?

CLYDE
...What if we don't want to be your
friend?

CARTMAN
Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing
we have to do is cut the list down from
twenty choices to ten. And so today
we will all be going to the amusement
park together to see who we want to
cut. Please keep in mind that this will
all be videotaped, so put on your best
friend faces, and may the best friend
win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten
dollar per person entrance fee.

[South Park, later. The camera looks at the end of Main Street,
and Butters comes over a bump on the street. He heads towards
the camera right in the middle of the street as the adults around
him talk or window-shop. He walks on, and a Bennigan's appears
to his left. He turns to look at it, then runs through the front
doors. He stops just inside. The diners go about eating and chatting.
A waitress serves a table]

BENNIGAN'S CHEF
Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order
twenty-four is up.

[Butters sees the dishes and walks up to them. He stares at them
for a few seconds, then switches them, grinning evilly. He then
drops down quickly as a waitress comes for the dishes. She delivers
them to the two diners who ordered them]

MAN 1
Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered
the chicken soup. This is minnestrone.


MAN 2
Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here.


BUTTERS
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this
puny world uhwill bow down to me!


[Montage 1 - A Day At The Amusement Park.]

STAN
So today we went to the amusement park
with all our possible friends.  It was
a really fun time. We rode all the rides
and everyone got along great.

CARTMAN
I think the person that stood out most
at the amusement park was Jimmy.


JIMMY
Well, the, the reason I think I would
make the perfect foreh- friend, is that
I love telling jokes. You know, who
doesn't like to laugh?

KYLE
Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice.
Tweek has a lot of qualities that I
look for in a friend.

TWEEK
What if they don't pick me? What if
they get us all, man! I mean, Christ!
If they can get to the Pentagon, then
they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!


DOG POO
I think I deserve to take Kenny's place
the most, because, I've been hanging
around these guys for like five years
and I never get to say or do anything.


CARTMAN
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in
class, but he never does anything. He's
more like a prop.

KYLE
Towelie is a tough choice because,
even though I can see how always having
a towel around can come in handy, he's
just always so high.

TOWELIE
Man, I really hope I win, because...
wait... why is this again? I have no
idea what's goin' on.

CARTMAN
We decided to get some one-on-one time
with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The
great thing was that, because Jimmy's
crippled, we got to go to the front
of the line.  That was definitely big
points for Jimmy, you know, but, but
then we got to the ride itself, and...


JIMMY
Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting
in the log, fellas.

RIDE OPERATOR
O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.


CARTMAN
Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some
points.

KYLE
But right now I'd say if we're gonna
have a retard for a friend, I, I have
to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't
tell any jokes.

JIMMY
Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we
great pals or what?

STAN
One thing for sure: picking our new
freidn isn't gonna be easy.

[South Park, day. Butters is still dressed as Professor Chaos,
still walking down the street. A dog walks across the street
and Butters stops next to it.]

BUTTERS
Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!


[Butters' house, later. He makes it to his room and locks the
door. He cackles again]

BUTTERS
Ah, the look on their faces when they
got the wrong soup. I love bringing
chaos!  And that's only the beginning!


[Cartman's backyard, day. All the kids are seated as they were
yesterday. A box of roses sites on stage.]

CARTMAN
All right, everyone. It was a tough
decision, but based on our time with
you all at the amusement park, we have
whittled our choices down to ten.  If
you receive a rose, please stay. If
you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle,
will you announce the people we want
to stay?

KYLE
Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy

TIMMY
Timmih!

TWEEK
Oh man! This is too much pressure!


KYLE
Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .


CARTMAN
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does
it go to?

KYLE
Tweek.

TWEEK
Aaarr!

CARTMAN
All right, the rest of you, thanks for
coming. Get the fudge out!

DOG POO
I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't
make the cut??

DOUGIE
I didn't even get a chance to have them
get to know me!

STAN
All right, congratulations to those
of you selected to stay. In the end,
one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good
luck.

[South Park, morning. Butters' house, kitchen. Linda is preparing
some breakfast and Butters comes in confidently]

LINDA
Good morning, Butters.

BUTTERS
It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear
about what's been goin' on? Some horrible
new supervillain made somebody get the
wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.

LINDA
No,  I didn't hear about that.

BUTTERS
Yeh, you didn't?

[Butters' house, living room. Butters walks up to Chris, who
is on the sofa reading the newspaper]

BUTTERS
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper
real quick?

CHRIS
Why sure, Butters. I was just about
to get some breakfast.

BUTTERS
Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal
media! They're keeping the stories of
my deads covered up, so as not to cause
a panic. Well, I guess it's time to
take it up a notch!

[The bus stop, later. Stan, Kyle and Cartman stand with Craig.
Scene music plays]

STAN
Okay, next?

KYLE
This looks pretty good.

STAN
Yeah,it's not bad. Next?

TIMMY
Timmay!

CARTMAN
Next?

[South Park Elementary, day. Most of the class is present. Stan,
Kyle, and Cartman stand at the front of the class. On the chalkboard
is the times table for 4]

CARTMAN
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you
all work as a friend during classtime.
Your performances will be judged primarily
on how you help us cheat and give us
answers. So good luck, everybody.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Sit down, boys.

CARTMAN
Alrighty then.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
All right, children, before we get started,
has anybody seen the eraser for the
chalkboard?  It probably got knocked
on the floor somewhere. Can you all
just please look around your desks for
it?

BUTTERS
Yes. Look around for your precious
eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's
in my back yard, buried three feet below
the surface of the earth.  And do you
even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all
see how you all like your dear chalkboard
without an eraser.  And information,
it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up,
until your minuscule brains can take
it no longer!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got
a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today
children, we're gonna learn about multiplying
times five.

BUTTERS
So! You all think that you can outsmart
Professor Chaos, do you?!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, whenever we multiply a number times
five, the result is going to end in
a zero or a five.

BUTTERS
Ms. Choksondik,

MS. CHOKSONDIK
What is it, Butters?

BUTTERS
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really
bad.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom
pass and go.  Okay, so for instance,
children-

BUTTERS
Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom
now. If anybody needs me, ah that's
where I'll be.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance,
five times one is... what, Eric?

CARTMAN
Uh, what's the question again?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Five... times...  one.

CARTMAN
Five times one is of course...

THE CLASS
Five.

CARTMAN
Five.

BUTTERS
The time for fun and games is over,
feeble-minded fools!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Who are you?

BUTTERS
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction
and maker of doom! Those who do not
know me yet shall know me very soon,
for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Hey! That kid took my last eraser!
Come back here, kid!

BUTTERS
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom.
Ah I really let one go in there.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Butters, did you see another little
kid run out of here?

BUTTERS
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down
and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look
at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss.
Go on and see the red mark on my elbow,
the red mark I made myself to throw
you off Professor Chaos's trail.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold
on and stay here, children.

[South Park Elementary, later. Recess. The kids are at play.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Craig are standing together]

KYLE
You're such a fatass, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!


STAN
Shut up, fatass!

CRAIG
Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.


CARTMAN
Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful
stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much.


[Betters' house, night. Craig is at his desk working with his
hamster set.]

BUTTERS
It is almost ...complete. The creation
of my minions who will assist me in
bringing terror to the world.  There
we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.
Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies.
Your time to bring dest-struction will
come very soon.  Aaahhh!

LINDA
Butters, a note for you was left on
the front door.

BUTTERS
A note?

LINDA
Here you go.  And wash your hands after
you touch those hamster - you'll get
AIDS

BUTTERS
Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered
my horrible secret. This could be a
trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at
the docks, precious FBI! But it is I
who'll have the trap set for you! Come,
my minions!  We haven't much time!


[Cartman's backyard, night. Stan, Kyle and Cartman are on stage
for the next round of elimination]

CARTMAN
All right, everyone, the time has come
for us to narrow the list down from
ten to six. But first, let us just say
that the people who we didn't pick were
only not picked because they totally
sucked balls. Kyle?

PIP
They're not going to pick me. I just
know they're not.

TWEEK
O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!

KYLE
Token.

TOKEN
All right!

KYLE
Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmay!

KYLE
Tweek.  Pip

PIP
Really? I don't believe it.

KYLE
Towelie.

PIP
What?

CARTMAN
Just one mroe rose, Kyle.

KYLE
Jimmy.

JIMMY
Oh boy! Oh thank God!

CARTMAN
All right, those with roses will move
on to the swimsuit and talent competition.
The rest of you, get the fudge out!


CLYDE
This whole thing is stupid! You don't
pick people you wanna be with by making
it into a game!

CARTMAN
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde,
I believe I said, "get the fudge out!"
Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go
fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge
out, Clyde!

[South Park docks, night. Under a red moon, Butters sneaks along
the docks, making sure no one sees him. He creeps from box to
box and peeks out from behind one. Another face peeks out from
behind a box at the other end of the docks. This face is younger,
with glasses]

DOUGIE
Hey Butters.

BUTTERS
Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name
is Professor Chaos.

DOUGIE
I saw you change in the school bathroom.
You stole that eraser in your class.


BUTTERS
Very well. You called out Professor
Chaos, and you also called out, eh your
own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go
and take this, this foolish mortal down!
Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-
come back minions.

DOUGIE
I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor
Chaos. I want to join you.

BUTTERS
Join me?

DOUGIE
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest
of destruction.

BUTTERS
But why?

DOUGIE
I'm an outcast, too. A frail child
cast aside by society. I want to follow
you and... whatever you're doing.


BUTTERS
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice
in evil. Together, we shall bring the
world to its knees! A-and make all those
who banished us from society run...
red.

DOUGIE
Do I get a neato costume made out of
aluminum foil, too?

BUTTERS
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor,
and you shall be my general. From now
on you are General... Disarray.

DOUGIE
General Disarray.

BUTTERS
Now let us go look for my minions!
They ran away here, now to find 'em...


[Montage 2 - The Swimsuit And Talent Competition. Stan, Kyle,
and Cartman sit on the chairs in the audience. The six remaining
candidates are on stage.]

CARTMAN
The swinsuit competition really gave
us a fresh look at some of the candidates.


JIMMY
Well, I don't think I did too well
in the... bathing suit competition.
But I can't wait for the talent show
competition. That'll really my chance
to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience.
So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A
guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy
walks into a guy walks into a  babuh
ba-a-a, uh-

TOWELIE
Okay wait...  No, no wait.

CARTMAN
Next please.

TOKEN
Well, what am I supposed to do?

KYLE
Anything that'll impress us, Token.


CARTMAN
If you were our friend, how would you
keep us entertained?

TOKEN
Aaaah. Oh, I know.

CARTMAN
Very nice.

STAN
I like it.

KYLE
Well Token was a definite winner for
talent show. But then we decided to
take everyone to a baseball game, to
see how we got along there.

[Coors Field in Denver. The game is underway. A shot of the field.]


ANNOUNCER
There goes a hit to left field, and
Foley's going to score.

[the bleachers. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Pip sit and watch the
game]

ALL
Woohoo!

KYLE
Yeah! Isn't this great?!

VENDOR
Kids, get your drinks here.

PIP
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?


CARTMAN
You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you
French piece of crap!

PIP
Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.


CARTMAN
All right, that does it! Pip, get the
fudge out! Next!

STAN
Okay, let's try this.

CARTMAN
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?


BUTTERS
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives
are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,
and this is my partner ih-in evil,
General Disarray! In the past few days
I have rained terror down upon the society
that shunned me! And now it is time
for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to...
flood... the world!

MAN 3
Flood the world?

MAN 4
My God!

WOMAN
I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!


BUTTERS
Oh yes. Every living creature and every
sacred building will soon be under leagues
and leagues of cold and dark water.
And there is nothing you can do to stop
me! General Disarray, begin the flooding
of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves!
You made the outcasts of the world!
Now watch! Watch as your precious planet
drowns! Watch!

MAN 5
Jesus Christ, who will save us?

MAN 6
We have very little time to live. How,
how shall we spend our last hours on
earth?

FANS
Yeah! All right!

[Butters' house, day. Butters and Dougie are in the back yard
watching their puddle grow and grow]

BUTTERS
Our reign of terror is complete! Our
tur- turmoil has now come full circle!
Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray?


DOUGIE
It's on all the way.

BUTTERS
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now
but watch the world die!  Boy, this
sure is takin' a long time.

[Stan's house, dining room. The three boys sit at the table with
pictures of the six candidates. They discuss their findings.]


STAN
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie
as our new friend?

CARTMAN
I think Towelie is awesome.

KYLE
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned
all the time. You can't really rely
on him for anything.

STAN
Oh, this is giving me a headache.


KYLE
Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't
take this decision lightly. Whoever
we pick is going to be the person we
do everything with from now on.

STAN
You're right. Well now, how about Timmy?
He's quiet and he takes direction well.


CARTMAN
Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.


STAN
How about Token?

CARTMAN
Token's a smartass.

KYLE
So? You're a smartass!

CARTMAN
Yeah. Do we really need another one?


KYLE
Good point.

JIMMY
Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif-
gift basket.

CARTMAN
Oh, thanks Jimmy

JIMMY
There's some chocolates and lih-licorice,
and some games and peh- pencils inside.


STAN
That's great.

KYLE
Cool.

JIMMY
Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you,
you friends later.

CARTMAN
Alright Jimmy, see ya.

STAN
Suckup.

[Butters' house, next day, backyard. The pool has covered much
of the yard. General Disarray jumps in the water as Professor
Chaos looks on passively on the porch]

BUTTERS
Not long now, General Disarray, and...
our horrible plan will be complete.


DOUGIE
Hey, do you think maybe we should build
a boat? You know, like a little raft
or something, so that when the world
floods you and me and the minions can
live?

BUTTERS
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's
a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.
Hey, who is that?

WORKER 1
Is this it?

WORKER 2
Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one.


BUTTERS
Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah!
You may have won this time! But I will
be back!

DOUGIE
What do we do now?

BUTTERS
Well I had another idea of how to kill
the world, but I thought it was... almost
too horrible to e- to even speak of,
but-  but now they have left me with
no other choice!

[Cartman's backyard, day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are on stage
while the candidates sit in the audience. Pip is missing]

CARTMAN
Well, this is it. We have made our final
decision and one of you is who we will
be spending our childhood with, as our
new friend.

JIMMY
Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please.


CARTMAN
Four friends, just one rose. The moment
of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the
rose go to?

[A hilltop, later. Butters reaches the top of a hill carrying
a box, with a red sky above him. He sets the box down]

BUTTERS
This is is, General Disarray. My final
solution.

DOUGIE
What evil plot do you have this time,
Professor Chaos?

BUTTERS
Simple, my dear general. We are going
to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere!
Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the
polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world
with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful
rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious
ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand
me another one, General Disarray.


ANNOUNCER
Will Professor Chaos's latest plot succeed
and be the final undoing of Earth?
And which boy has been chosen to be
the replacement for Kenny?  And which
of these six South Park residents was
killed, and will never be seen again?
The answer to those questions will
be answered... right now.  No.  Tweek.
Ms. Choksondik.

"FAT CAMP"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's classroom. Ms.
Choksondik enters and stands before the blackboard.]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, as I'm sure you all
remember, today we are going to continue
our biology lesson... b dissecting an
organism.

CLASS
Yeah!

BEBE, NEW KUD
Woohoo.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, what we are going to dissect today
is the West Indian manatee.  Manatees
are mammals that live in the oceans
and are often called the gentle clowns
of the sea.

WENDY
Aha, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees
endangered?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
They sure are, Wendy, and that's why
we must learn what's inside them.  Now,
we don't have quite enough  manatees
to go around, so I think we're gonna
have to split up into groups of four.


BUTTERS
Hey! Ours is still alive!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, hold on.  Now, children, our first
incision will be along the abdomen.


STAN
I can't do it, dude.

KYLE
Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it,
Kenny.

KENNY
(Nuh uh!)

KYLE
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five
bucks to do it!

KENNY
(FIVE BUCKS???)

STAN
Too bad Cartman's missng this. He must
be really sick.

[The Cartman house, living room. Cartman and his mom watch TV.
Cartman laughs. Terrance and Phillip are on. They are dressed
as detectives They look at a corpse with a dagger stabbed into
the chest]

PHILLIP
Say Terrance, this body appears to have
been moved since the murder. Look at
the forensic evidence around the torso.


TERRANCE
I don't see anything.

PHILLIP
Look closer.  Closer.  Hunh-nh.

TERRANCE
I still don't see anything, Phillip.


PHILLIP
Waitwait. Hunh.

CARTMAN
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You
wanna know what's gonna happen?

PHILLIP
Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic
evidence is right around here.  Ah!
Af!

TERRANCE
AAHahahahahahaaa!

CARTMAN
Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I
can't believe how the show manages to
stay fresh.

LIANE
Eh yes, sweetie.

CARTMAN
Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry
chocolate-mix butter bar?

LIANE
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself?
Mommy's  expecting  some company.


CARTMAN
God, I have to everythng around here!


[The Cartman house, kitchen. Cartman grabs a stool and walks
over to the kitchen counter with it. He starts singing softly
as he prepares his dish. He pulls out some Pop Toasties and puts
them in a toaster, gets some powdered chocolate milk and a stick
of butter, rolls the butter in the powdered milk, gets the Pop
Toasties, and places the chocolate-covered butter between the
two Pop Toasties. He squeezes down for good measure and makes
his way out of the kitchen.]

[The Cartman house, living room. Cartman enters singing to himself]


CARTMAN
I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the-
What the hell's going on?

LIANE
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to
have a "talk" with you.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Eric, your friends and your family are
all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?


CARTMAN
What?!

DR. DOCTOR
We believe that you might have a problem.


CARTMAN
You're God-damn right I have a problem!
Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't
have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell
is this?!

MR. GARRISON
It's called intervention, Eric.

LIANE
Your friends and I have all chipped
in and we're going to send you up to
a weight-management retreat.

CARTMAN
Fat camp?

DR. DOCTOR
Yes, fat camp.

CARTMAN
Alright, I don't know who the hell put
you all up to this,  but I am sure as
hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Now, Eric, all these people came here
and paid to send you to camp because
they care about you.

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to
see the look on your face when they
told you.

CARTMAN
Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat,
I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those
stories about how everyone in your famiy
was big as a child but then grew into
their bodies!

LIANE
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're
just fat.

[South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's class. The manatees
have been dissected in various places, and body parts are all
over the desks and floor. A drawing of the manatee and its organs
is now on the blackboard.]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
And now we will be removing the spleen.
Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed
for a qu-

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick
word with you?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, continue with the removal
of the spleen, childen. I'll be right
back.

KYLE
Aw, dude, check this out.

STAN
That's so gross.

KYLE
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat
this?

KENNY
(I'm not eatin' that!)

KYLE
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.


STAN
I'll throw in five.

[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Principal Victoria talks
to Ms. Choksondik there.]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And so apparently there's been a little
mixup. The manatees were meant to go
to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the
frogs were meant to come here.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh dear.

[South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's class. Some desks
have been moved aside and the kids continue contributing to the
kitty...]

BUTTERS
I'll throw in a dollar!

BEBE
I've got three.

KYLE
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat
it very fast!

STAN
forty-one bucks.  Eww-ho-hoo! He did
it!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, now, let's get back
in our seats. Uh, we are now going to
put the manatees back together.

[A wooded area, day. A camp is shown in some hills. It is called
"Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center." The Cartman
station wagon drives into the camp]

LIANE
...And it has basketball courts and tennis
courts, and you can call Mommy any time
you want.  Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be
mad. I'm sure you're going to have a
good time. And when you come back you'll
be all healthy and thin.

MALE COUNSELOR
Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors
here. This must be Eric Cartman.

LIANE
Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.


MALE COUNSELOR
Oh, we'll change that.  Hello, camper.
My name is Rick. How are you doing?


CARTMAN
Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are
you?

RICK
I'm doing great! Why don't you come
on out and we'll get yo oriented.  I'll
take care of him from here, ma'am.


LIANE
Oh.  Well, goodbye, sweetie.

CARTMAN
Don't touch me!

RICK
Eric, this is the beginning of a whole
new life for you!

[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, later. A
group of kids, all of them fat, stand in a circle and look at
each other.]

BRUNETTE
Have you got any candy?

CARTMAN
No.

Taller Boy	[to Cartman's left] My mon says I ain't to eat no
candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.

RICK
Alright! Everybody's here and that
means we can get down to business! Over
the next few weeks we're gonna learn
that losing weight is  fun, right gang?


TALLER BOY
Right.

RICK
Wait a second.  Do you kids hear something?
I could've swore that-

PINK MONSTER
Raaarrrr!!!

RICK
Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!

PINK MONSTER
I'm gonna take over your body and make
you slow!

RICK
Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I
know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise!
And... Proper Diet.

PINK MONSTER
Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have
killed me.

RICK
I guess we took care of that bad old
fat, didn't we kids?

TALLER BOY
Yeah!

RICK
Well, hold on a second. Because that
glutinous fat was really our good friend,
Susan,  who's another weight counselor!


TALLER BOY
Heh! It was a lady in a costume!

CARTMAN
Would somebody put this retard out
of his misery?!

[South Park Elementary, day, playground. Stan and Pip stand by
Kenny, who's groaning in pain and holding his stomach.]

KYLE
What's the matter?

STAN
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee
spleen made him sick.

KYLE
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made
him eat it.

KIDS
Eewww.

STAN
Well, at least you got it out of your
system.

KYLE
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the
spleen!  How much, Kenny?

KENNY
(WHAT?!)

KYLE
I'll give you five bucks.to eat your
puke.

BUTTERS
Huh-I'm in for five!

STAN
Oh, you guys!

CLYDE
I've got three.

TOKEN
Six!

BUTTERS
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my
R. Kelly thermos.

KYLE
That's 19 bucks, Kenny!

KENNY
(Ungh.)

KIDS AROND KENNY
:	AAAAA!

KIDS AROUND TIMMY
:	Waugh.

KYLE
Kick ass, dude!

STAN
You know, dude, there might be something
to this.

KYLE
Yeah. People are willing to pay big
money to see Kenny do this stuff.


[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, later. The
counselors come up over a hill and down the other side jogging.
They stop]

RICK
Doing great kids! Come on!

CARTMAN
This... is... bullcrap!

[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, mess hall,
after dinner. Rick is talking to the kids]

RICK
Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and
protein bar! How about you, gang?


CARTMAN
I'm starving. This is it. I'm going
to die here.

SUSAN
I hope you all left room for dessert.
Soybean pudding for everybody!

BRUNET BOY
Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?


CARTMAN
Take it! I can't eat this crap!

BLONDE GIRL
Me neither. I have to have sugar or
I'm going to die.

CARTMAN
Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we
used to sneak stuff in by hiding it
up oour ass.

BRUNET BOY
I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You
want some?

CARTMAN
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that
one again!

[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, night. Cartman
sneaks out and creeps along the side of the campers' cabin]


CARTMAN
Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear
the counselor building and we're free.
We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only
question is, do we go home to our traitor
moms and friends, or do we start a new
life on the run?  An ice cream truck!
Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!


DRIVER
Can I interest you in some ice cream?


CARTMAN
You're damn right you can! Two Roller
Pops, please!

DRIVER
Alrighty, do you want this kind or
this kind?

CARTMAN
Hunh?  Uuh!

BOY 1
They tricked us again, huh?

CARTMAN
Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA!


DRIVER
Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a
matter of no time.

[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, moments later.
The campers' cabin door is opened and the five escapees return
to their bunks]

BOY 1
They always get us. Sometimes it's a
ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco
stand. But they always fool us..

TALLER BOY
Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything.
Any amount of money for some candy.


RICK
Hey kids!

SUSSAN
Looks like we had some attemptted escapees
again tonight.

RICK
Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that
camp is tough, but you have to believe
that you can do it. And you have to
know that until you drop the weight,
you can't leave.

SUSAN
Thre is no escape.

RICK
So let's just all put on our try-hard
helmets, and accept that the only way
for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE
THE WEIGHT

ERIC
Aw, damnit!

[South Park, the Cartman house. Butters and Timmy have replaced
Cartman in the boy's group for now, and they stand in front of
the Broflosdki parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, Sharon March,
Principal Victoria, and Dr. Doctor. They argue amongst themselves.]


KYLE'S FATHER
That's what being young is all about.


MR. GARRISON
But that's not the question.

LIANE
Thanks for coming, everybody.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman?
Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble
at his weight-management camp?

STAN
We knew he wouldn't make it.

LIANE
Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed
up and surprised me last night. Ladies
and gentlemen, I would like to present
to you... the new Eric Cartman.

NEW CARTMAN
Hey, dudes!

KYLE
Whoa!

STAN
I don't believe it.

LIANE
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his
fat camp.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Congratulations. How do you feel?

NEW CARTMAN
I feel awesome!

KYLE
What did they do with all the fat? There
must have been enough to last an Eskimo
family months.

NEW CARTMAN
You know, Kyle? There was a time when
your fat jokes would have gotten to
me. But now I'm totally slim and totally
happy! In fact, I'd say I'm  a little
bit trimmer than you, fatboy!  Heh heh.
Just kidding, Kyle.

LIANE
I made some healthy tofu pudding to
celebrate. Who wants some?

CARTMAN
Memememeee!

KYLE
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like
the new Eric Cartman.

STAN
Did you like the old one?

KYLE
Good point.

[Jesus and Pals]

ANNOUNCER
And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South
Park Public Access.

JESUS
Back to our courageous story of a little
boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea.
You found that the Spirit of the Lord
inside you gave you strength.

NEW CARTMAN
No. Actually, I found a diet that totally
works.

JESUS
A little boy who overcame the odds.
Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well,
our second guest tonight is a young
man named Kenny McCormick, who is going
to eat dog crap. Kenny?

NEW CARTMAN
God-damnit, all I got was a little golf
clap!

JESUS
Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.


KENNY
(Sure!)

MAN 1
Do it again!

MAN 2
Do it again!

MAN 3
Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat
a really old piece of bacon!

NEW CARTMAN
This is ridiculous!

JESUS
So. Kenny, how did you discover that
you had this... talent?

STAN
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's
the one that does it all, but we were
the masterminds of the whole thing.


JESUS
I can't say I approve of this, my children.


KYLE
Huh? Why not?

JESUS
Because Kenny is only doing things that
anybody could do. For money. He's a
prostitute.

MAN 4
I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone
else's vomit.

MAN 5
Yeah!

MAN 6
Yeah! Go for it!

STAN
What's a prostitute?

KYLE
I don't know.

[South Park Elementary, day, cafeteria. The kids mill around
and eat during lunchtime. In line for their lunches are Criag,
Tweek, Butters, and a few others. In the kitchen Stan, Kyle,
and Kenny arrive for their lunches.]

CHEF
Hello there, children!

STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Hey, Chef:

STAN
Chef, what's a prostitute?

CHEF
Dag-nabbit children! How come every
time you come in here you gotta be askin'
me questons that I shouldn't be answering?!
"Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's
a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call
it a rim jub, Chef?"  For once, can't
just come in here and say, "Hi Chef.
Nice day, isn't it?"!

STAN
Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?

CHEF
It sure is! Thank you.

STAN
Chef, what's a prostitute?

CHEF
Uh uh! You children are gonna get me
in trouble with the principal again.


NEW CARTMAN
Lunchtime! I'm starved!

CHEF
Oh my God. Eric?

NEW CARTMAN
That's me.

STAN
Chef was just about to tell us what
a protitute is.

CHEF
Why do you need to know what a prostitue
is anyway?!

STAN
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a
prostitute. Is he?

KENNY
(Yeah. Am I?)

CHEF
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not
a prostitute.

KYLE
Why?

CHEF
Well, because, children, a prostitute
is someone who... you could pay for certain
services.

STAN
Like what?

CHEF
Like keeping you company. Understand?


STAN
No.

CHEF
You see, chidren, sometimes a man needs
to be with a woman. But sometimes, when
the lovin' is over, the woman just wants
to talk and talk and talk and talk.


But a prostitute is someonen who would love you

No matter who you are, or what you look like. Yes, it's true,
children.

[the new Crtman looks at the other boys as he starts sneaking
away. They don't notice him. Other kids, Jordan, Token, Clyde,
Butters, and Bebe, enter the kitchen]

That's not why you pay a prostitute,

no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.


[Principal Victoria arrives and listens]

That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes! Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. James Taylor.

JAMES TAYLOR


A prostitute is like any other woman

They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.

[the new Cartman goes into the upply room and starts packing
donuts into his backpack]

CHEF
And that's why I say-

CHEF
Oohhhh  ...James Taylor, what the hell
are you doin' in here?! Singing' about
prostitutes to the children! Get out
of here!  ...These children tricked me!


[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, that night.
After being tucked int bed, the new Cartman senaks out and rides
a bike towards the Center, hides the bike near the entrance,
and approaches the gate]

NEW CARTMAN
Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the
goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts,
and some beef gravy.

CARTMAN
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?


NEW CARTMAN
Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny
you.

CARTMAN
Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!


NEW CARTMAN
Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.


CARTMAN
What?!

NEW CARTMAN
I'm the one risking my ass, running
around in that stupid town pretending
to be you and collecting all the food
to bring up here! All you have to do
is sit back and sell it to all the fat
kids!

CARTMAN
Alright alright! Keep your voice down!
I'll bump you up to 10%.

NEW CARTMAN
Twenty.

CARTMAN
Suck my balls, 20!

NEW CARTMAN
Fine! Then I shall bid you good day!


CARTMAN
Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just
remember that your parents thnk that
you're in the drug rehab center next
door! You blow your cover and we're
both screwed!

[The University of Colorado, dorm room. Several students are
reading their books while clothes is strewn all over the place]


STUDENT 1
You guys! You have to check this tape

STUDENT 2
Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are

STUDENT 1

STUDENT 2

Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!


NEW CARTMAN
This is so juvenile.

KYLE

STAN
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got
skinny. What's up?

NEW CARTMAN
Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of
that licorice to- take home?

[Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, next night.
Rick is in the campers' cabin]

RICK
Alright campers, good work today. Lights
out, and we'll see you tomorrow for
more exercise and proper diet.

SUSAN
All beddy-byes for the night, are they?


RICK
I don't know what we're doing wrong,
Susan. These kids aren't losing the
weight.

SUSAN
We;ll just have to give them more time.
They'll do it!

RICK
They'll do it.

SUSAN
They'll do it!!

CARTMAN
Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman
store is open!

BLONDE GIRL
Two donuts and a pack of licorice,
please.

CARTMAN
Two donuts and a pack of licorice.
Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you
crying, Chad?

CHAD
'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't
wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control
myself when they're right in front of
me like this.  All my life I've been
fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps
and I swore to my momma that I'd lose
the weight. I want to, but I can't help
myself.

CARTMAN
Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need?
You need a friend.

CHAD
I'd, I do?

CARTMAN
Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy
Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy
Bar likes you just the way you are.
Look at how yummy and sweet he is.
...There you go. That'll just be four
dollars.  ...There you go.

miss this once-in-a-lifetime event.
Order now!

[The big city, day. City noise is heard. Next shot is in a studio,
with Howard Stern hosting, and three guests. On the walls are
posters, one of which is of Eltn John. Two loves dolls are in
the background, and the Antonio Banderas one is behind Stern]


HOWARD STERN
Alright, so we're back talkin' to three
competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny
Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy
Kenny.

TOM GREEN
Hey, Howard.

HOWARD STERN
Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View
special this week, where he will crawl
up into a bus driver's uterus and stay
there for six hous.

JOHNNY KNOXVILLE
Wow!

HOWARD STERN
Now, some people that all you guys do
is perform sick and disgusting acts
for shock value and money, which makes
you whores. But I'd like to prove them
wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm
gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give
me oral sex right now.

TOM GREEN
I'm in.

JOHNNY KNOXVILLE
Me too.

KENNY

CAMPERS
Woo-ugh.

SUSAN
Please, Mr. Sanders.

MR. SANDERS
No! I have had it!

RICK
What's happening?

SUSAN
Horace's parents want to take him home.


RICK
Oh! But he's not ready yet.

MR. SANDERS
Look at what you've done to my boy!
You told Horace that he was responsible
for his weight! You made him believe
that with exercise and proper diet,
he could be thin! When we told you it
was his genetics!

RICK
They can lose the weight if they try.


MR. SANDERS
Look at these kids! They're not getting
any thinner!  Your camp is a fraud!
You need to accept the fact that most
fat people are just genetically fat!


SUSAN
Please, sir, if you give us one more
week,...

MR. SANDERS
Your time is up!

MRS. SANDERS
Yeah, your time is up!

MR. SANDERS
And I'm going to call all the other
parents to tell them to come claim their
kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of
time!

HORACE
But, Dad, I...

MR. SANDERS
What?!

HORACE
...Nothin'.

SUSAN
We're in trouble, Rick.

[South Park, day. At the television studio preparations are made
for Kenny's test of endurance. Tweek, Token, Clyde, Butters,
and Kyle (with hammer) are onstage. The sounds of sawing and
hammering fill the air. Ms. Crabtree is prepped for the test,
with her legs spread open and the genital area blocked off by
small curtains.]

KYLE
Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table
enough?

MS. CRABTREE
HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?

KYLE
Six hours.

MS. CRABTREE
HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE
HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!

KYLE
Great.

STAN
You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested
for prostitution in New York!

KYLE
For what?

STAN
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!

BUTTERS
Who-what's a hummer??

STAN
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is
in jail for at least three months!


KYLE
Three months?! But the per-per-view
is tomorrow!

STAN
I know!

KYLE
He worked so hard, come so close. Now
we'll never see Kenny crawl up into
Ms. Crabtree's uterus.

NEW CARTMAN
You know, maybe we've all learned something
here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further
and further himself each time, havin'
to always outdo himself. Now he's in
jail for being a whore. And perhaps,
just perhaps, we are to blame.

KYLE
...Alright, that does it!  This has been
bothering the hell out of me!  I knew
it! You're not Cartman at all!

NEW CARTMAN
Uh oh.

every disgusting thing in the book,

equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?

attention paid to my coot since I was
16!

now the new Kenny, ready, dressing him like Kenny.]

KYLE
Don't wory, dude. You're gonna do great.


NEW KENNY
No way! I'm not doing this!

KYLE
Hoh, you're doing it, or else we're
gonna bust your whole scheme wide open,
and tell your mom you haven't actually
been at your drug rehab this whole time!


NEW KENNY
But this isn't fair!

STAN
Deal, druggie!

NEW KENNY

Good-bye, Alice.

ALICE
Good-bye. Thank you.

Oh, don't thnak us. We failed you.


CARTMAN
...65, 66, 67...

CHAD
Wait a second! This isn't right!  It's
time for me to be responsible for my
own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating
candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's
been sneaking in junk food!

CARTMAN
Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!

HORACE
No, he's right. The counselors've been
doing a good job. We've just been cheating.


OTHER CAMPERS
Yeah.

HORACE
I believe I can lose the weight with
exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna
make excuses no more.

GIRL
Me neither.

OTHER CAMPERS
Yeah.

HORACE
If you take us back, we promise we won't
cheat.

RICK
Well, it's alright with me. Parents?


MR. SANDERS
Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're
all donen you can teaach me a thing
or two, huh son?

CARTMAN
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick
of being the fat kid, too. I've been
making excuses all my life. But I know
deep down that if I took responsibility
and really tried hard, and we all tried
together, well we really can lose the
weight!

SUSAN
Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here
anymore.

CAMPERS
Yeah.

CARTMAN
What?!

RICK
Bubbye.

CARTMAN
Well, screw you, fatasses!

AUDIENCE
Four, three, two, one!

ANNOUNCER
He did it! Come on out, Kenny!  You
made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out

you could give him a little push.


AUDIENCE
OOOOHHHHHH!

DR. DOCTOR
He's dead. The pressure must have killed
him.

MS. CRABTREE
I told you I was a tight virgin flower.


STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort

KYLE
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s

"THE BIGGEST DOUCHE IN THE UNIVERSE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, night. A camera sits atop am ambulance transmiting
the action as the ambulance speeds down a street. It ends up
at Hall's Pass Hospital. The paramedics rush out and open the
cargo doors, quickly take Cartman out and whisk him into Emergency
while his mom remains seated anxiously inside the ambulance.]


LIANE
Be careful with my baby.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, inside. The paramedics reach the nurses'
station and rush by]

BLONDE NURSE
What have we got?

PARAMEDIC 1
Not sure. It looks like a possible
code five six!

CARTMAN
Kenny. Can't have Kenny.

LIANE
You're going to be okay, baby.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, operating room. Emergency personnel whisk
Cartman into the room. Liane enters, but stays near the door]


DR. DOCTOR
Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT.
And get something for the kid, too.


LIANE
Is he going to be okay??

BRUNETE NURSE
Let the doctor do his work, ma'am.


[Hell's Pass Hospital, a few hours later. Cartman is now in one
of the recovery rooms with Liane at his side stroking him gently.
He's on a respirator for the time being. The doctor enters the
room slowly, but Liane notices and rises to meet him]

LIANE
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong
with him?

DR. DOCTOR
I'm afraid he's... running out of time.


LIANE
Why?? What's wrong with him??

DR. DOCTOR
It's his time. It's ...running out.


LIANE
Well what does he need?

DR. DOCTOR
He needs to have more time.

LIANE
What can we do?

DR. DOCTOR
Well, I suppose we could try a time
transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist.


LIANE
It's going to be okay, baby. We're
going to get you more time.

CARTMAN
Ey Kenny! God-damn you Kenny!

[Chef's house, day. Stan and Kyle go up to the front door and
Kyle knocks. Chef opens up and sees them.]

CHEF
Hello there, children.

STAN
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They
think he might die.

KYLE
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or
not we should care.

CHEF
Well what's wrong with him?

STAN
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think
it's because he drank Kenny's soul four
weeks ago.

KYLE
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman
drank it, thinking it was chocolate
milk mix.

CHEF
Children, why didn't you tell me about
this sooner?

KYLE
Well like we said, we didn't know whether
or not we should care?

CHEF
Well you should. Cartman is your friend
whether you like him or not! Now, come
on! We've gotta get to that hospital!


[Hell's Pass Hospital, Cartman's recovery room. Dr. Doctor has
returned]

LIANE
He's looking a little better today.


DR. DOCTOR
Yes, but his time is still getting weaker.
It will give out soon unless we do something.


CARTMAN
Hey you guys! How's it goin'?

CHEF
Cartman?

STAN
No, that's Kenny.

CARTMAN
What the hell are you assholes doing
here?!

STAN
That's Cartman.

CHEF
Oh my God! Eric, how long have you
been channelin' Kenny?

CARTMAN
Oh, about a month.

DR. DOCTOR
Let's not validate his delusions.

CHEF
Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need
to get free?

CARTMAN
He's gone again.

CHEF
Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman
to a meeting room to speak with people
who have crossed over.

DR. DOCTOR
What?? That's preposterous! What this
child needs is a time transplant!


CHEF
This hospital isn't gonna do any good.
We need to take him to see John Edward.


STAN
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV
show where he brings poeple on and talks
to their dead relatives.

CHEF
That's right. We have to go see him
in New York.

DR. DOCTOR
I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's
time could give out at any minute. He
needs to be kept here where his time
could be monitored.

LIANE
Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing
roulette with my child's life!  Ooo
wait, Hairspray is showing in New York,
isn't it? Let's go there.

CHEF
Good. You children need to come too.
Eric needs all the support he can get
right now.

Kenny how we can get him out, please?


JOHN EDWARD
Doesn't work that way.  Now, Kenny
is telling me that... you're his best
friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.


STAN
No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.


JOHN EDWARD
Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's
Kyle?

KYLE
I'm Kyle.

JOHN EDWARD
Oh right. And uh, did an older woman
pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a
grandma?

KYLE
Yeah. My Grandma.  She's here?

JOHN EDWARD
She says there was something she asked
you to do, and you're not doing it?
She wants you to look for four white
doves.

KYLE
Oh my God!

JOHN EDWARD
Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe
it's a puh-? Or a huh-?

WOMAN 1
My Harry died last year!

JOHN EDWARD
Oh, it's comin' from over here.  I'm
getting all kinds of voices today.
Woo!

STAN
Heh hey wait a minute dude.

JOHN EDWARD
Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh
well, he's saying that you two used
to... do things.

WOMAN 1
Mmm-hmm.

JOHN EDWARD
And that those things involved... stuff?


WOMAN 1
The things did involve stuff, yes.


[New York, outside John Edward's studio. Chef, Liane and the
boys exit. Kyle is missing]

CHEF
Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled
by that asshole!

STAN
He seemed better on TV?

CHEF
Yeah. They must edit his shows down
on television to only show him getting
mostly right answers.

KYLE
Grandma's watching me. Always watching
me.

STAN
Dude, you don't believe that guy talked
to your grandma, do you?

LIANE
Eric?  It must be his time. I think
it's running out!

CHEF
We've got no choice. The only people
I know now who might be able to help
Eric are my parents. We'll have to take
the next flight to Scotland.

[New York Airport, day. The kids, Chef and Liane are ready for
their flights]

CHEF
Okay children, this is your flight
back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting
you at the airport in Denver.

STAN
We don't get to go to Scotland?

LIANE
It's too far and your parents want you
back home.

STAN
Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out
of you, fatso.

CARTMAN
Thanks, asshole.

CHEF
Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You
children get right on that plane now.


ANNOUNCER
This is the final boarding annoucenment
for Flight 342 to Denver.

STAN
That's us. Come on.

KYLE
Four white birds!

STAN
Huh?

KYLE
There's four white birds!  This is what
Grandma wants? She wants me to attend
Jewleeard.

STAN
Dude, you were going to see four white
birds eventually.

KYLE
So is it a coincidence that Grandma
DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard
someday?

STAN
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna
leave.

KYLE
I'm not going back.

STAN
What??

KYLE
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma
proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them.


STAN
Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap!

[John Edward's estate, later. Stan arrives and goes to the front
door. Needless to say, he didn't get on the plane either. He
rings the bell and is greeted by the butler]

STAN
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward,
please.

BUTLER
He doesn't do private readings.

STAN
I'm not here for a reading, I just need
to ask him something real quick.

BUTLER
Alright, come on in.

[John Edward's estate, living room. Stan waits by the sofa]


BUTLER
Just wait here. I'll go fetch him.


STAN
Jesus Christ.

BUTLER
Here he is.

PRERECORDED VOICE
Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward.


JOHN EDWARD
Thank you, thank you.

STAN
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor.
You, you did a reading on my best friend
and uh, well you kind of messed him
up.

JOHN EDWARD
Oh.  The John Edward show is not liable
for opinions and materials given for
entertainment purposes only.

STAN
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back
home to Colorado. All I need you to
do is just talk to him and tell him,
you know, the whole talking to dead
people isn't for real.

JOHN EDWARD
Maybe it is for real.

STAN
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you
do and I need you to just let my friend
Kyle know that so he can go on with
his life.

JOHN EDWARD
Look, people have the right to be skeptical.
I really hear voices in my head.

STAN
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads.
It's called "intuition." Get over yourself
and tell my friend it's just for fun.


JOHN EDWARD
Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody.
I give people closure and help them
cope with life.

STAN
No, you give them false hope and a belief
in something that isn't real.

JOHN EDWARD
But I'm a psychic.

STAN
No dude, you're a douche.

JOHN EDWARD
I'm not a douche! What if I really believe
that dead people talk to me?

STAN
Then you're a stupid douche

JOHN EDWARD
I think I've had of your bullying me!
Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs,
lock myself in my panic room and call
the police!

STAN
I'm nine years old.

JOHN EDWARD
I'm not talking to your friend and I'm
not a douche!  You'd better get out
of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the
police!

STAN
You are so a douche! I'm nominating
you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe
award, you douche!  Son of a bitch.


[An airplane to Scotland, day. The plane is flying above the
clouds. In the cabin, Cartman sits between Chef and Liane]


CARTMAN
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut
up, fatass!

LIANE
Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there
soon.

PILOT
Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip
to Edinburgh should take about twelve
hours.

CARTMAN
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!

PILOT
In the meantime we'd like to show you
a complimentary film.

CARTMAN
Oh, good.

ANNOUNCER
Rob Schneider is a Carrot. Rated PG-13.


CARTMAN
Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna
watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it's not
funny!

[The Jewleeard School, New York. Kyle approaches the school.
Stan runs up to intercept him.]

STAN
Kyle! Kyle!

KYLE
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is
what my grandma wants!

STAN
Look, I went and saw that John Edward
guy. He's just a big douche.

KYLE
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!


STAN
Kyle, you can't ruin your life based
on what some douchey psychic said. They
all just use a technique called "cold
reading." They've used it for hundreds
of years to make people believe them.


MAN 2
Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real.


STAN
No, he's not.

WOMAN 2
Yeah. My sister told me he knew our
mother's name and when she died.


CONSTRUCTION WORKER
John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked
up to a guy on the street, and said
his dead father wanted to say "Happy
Birthday," and it WAS his birthday.


WOMAN 3
Yeah kid, how do you explain that?


STAN
Alright, look. I'll show you. I just
need a volunteer. How about you?

WOMAN 4
Oh-ho. Me?

STAN
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead
person is talking to me about you, okay?


WOMAN 4
Okay.

STAN
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older
man, someone very close to you.

WOMAN 4
My father?

STAN
Does this month, November, hold a special
significance?

WOMAN 4
My birthday's in November!

STAN
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her
'Happy Brithday.'"

WOMAN 4
Oh my God.

STAN
See, Kyle? I just started with something
really vague. I chose an older man because
I'm betting that, based on this woman's
age, her father is most likely dead.
But if her father wasn't dead, I could
still say it was some other older man.


MAN 2
Well then how'd you know her birthday
was in November?

STAN
I didn't. I just asked her if November
meant anything. Her father could have
died in November, or Thanksgiving could
have been really special for them. But
I go with the birthday and validate
it now, as if I knew, by saying "He
wishes you a Happy Birthday."

WOMAN 4
What else does he say?

STAN
Okay, I'll just use an old standard.
He saying "the money. Stop worrying
about the money."

WOMAN 4
Oh my God! My sister and I have been
fighting over his inheritance.

WOMAN 3
That's amazing.

STAN
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance
is usually an issue, and money is something
everyone worries about.

MAN 3
That sounds a little too coincidental.


MAN 4
Yes. There's only one explanation. This
kid can communicate with the dead!


ADULTS
Wow!

STAN
What?!

MAN 2
Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.


WOMAN 3
Can you try to reach my grandfather.


STAN
No wait.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER
You have to tell me if my sister's in
a good place.

MAN 5
Yeah, help me out too, 'k?

MAN 6
I'm next. I'm next.

MAN 7
Hey, get out of my way!

MAN 8
Do me!

SCOUT
Kid, how would you like your own talking
to the dead show?

[Scotland, day, highlands. Night falls. Chef, Liane and Cartman
arrive at the McElroy manor and Chef knocks on the door. Bagpipes
that were playing stop. Mr. McElroy, Chef's dad, answers the
door]

CHEF
Hi Pop.

THOMAS MCELROY
Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you
now.

CHEF
These are my friends, the Cartmans.


THOMAS
Well come on in out of the cold now.
There's heavy fog on the moors tonight.
Well, look what the cat dragged in,
Nelly.

NELLY
Oh, my baby come home!

CHEF
Hi, Momma!

NELLY
Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till
nine.

CHEF
Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.


LIANE
Please, call me Liane.

NELLY
So nice to have you here, Liane.

THOMAS
And is this the children you told us
about?

CHEF
Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.

THOMAS
Well, let's see here now.  Mhm, mhm,
mhm.  Yeup! There's definitely more
than one children in there.

LIANE
Oh dear.

THOMAS
Nelly, you best have at it now.

NELLY
Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in
the oven, too.  Ain't gonna have no
time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame
me, a woman can't bake no roast and
do everything else at the same time.
Can't say that the roast is gonna be
terrible, maybe just a little dry.
But I suppose we can make some extra
gravy to take the dryness out later.


THOMAS
Alright, children, stand up on this
chair now.

CARTMAN
Right now?

THOMAS
Yes, right now.

NELLY
Na kamaa karash meh nah-

CARTMAN
Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.

NELLY
Come out now. Come out now.

THOMAS
Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what
she's doing.

NELLY
You all come out of there now.

["The Other Side"]

ANNOUNCER
At a vary young age one young boy learned
he had a special gift. This is "The
Other Side."

STAN
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.
This is a trick that I am doing. Okay?
Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name
that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?
They want me to acknowledge Pete, or
Peter.

WOMAN 5
Yes! Yes, my Peter!

AUDIENCE
Wow!!

STAN
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick
a random name and wait for somebody
in the audience to give a response.
Now that I see that there's a lone woman
crying, my instinct tells me Peter was
her husband. So I say, "Peter was your
husband?"

WOMAN 5
Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!

AUDIENCE
Wow!!

WOMAN 6
Oh wow!

STAN
Stop it! I didn't do anything!

MAN 9
You knew Peter was dead!

STAN
I didn't start by saying Peter is dead!
I started by saying, "They want me to
acknowledge Peter." That could have
meant Peter was in the audience or that
Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter
had died. I couldn't be wrong, see?
Now, I can look at this woman and see
that she's fairly young, so odds are
her husband was fairly young when he
died. So I can say something like, "I'm
getting that Peter's death was very
untimely"

WOMAN 6
Yes, it was.

AUDIENCE
Wow!!

MAN 10
Amazing!

WOMAN 7
Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.


STAN
Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!


[McElroy manor, night. Nelly is still working on Cartman. He's
laying on a bed, and Chef's dad helps in the exorcism]

THOMAS
In the name of all that is holy we command
this spirit be set free!

CARTMAN
Ahh, Aahhhh!

THOMAS
There we go! We're gettin' somethin'
now!

NELLY
Come on out, spirit. Go!

THOMAS
Come on out hyow! It's safe!  Here it
comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh!


NELLY
Oooo, that's the potatoes.

THOMAS
Well hold on the potatoes two seconds,
woman!  The soul's comin' out hyuh!
It's almost done. Alright, son. Now
bring me the victim child!

CHEF
The victim child?

THOMAS
Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice
so we could Kenny's soul into its body.


NELLY
Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim
child.

CHEF
Where were we gonna find a child to
secrifice?

NELLY
We weren't gonna ask you where you got
it from.

THOMAS
God-damnit! The spirit's out and it
don't have no where to go!

NELLY
Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the
curtains.

[The Jewleeard School, New York. Kyle is studying. Stan approaches
him with a stack of papers]

STAN
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials
on the Internet saying that John Edward
has the entire studio wired to hear
what people are talking about before
the show. And, he pays actors to be
plants in the audience.

KYLE
You're just jealous he's a better psychic
than you.

STAN
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New
York?! Then go ahead!

JOHN EDWARD
So, you think you can talk to dead people
better than me, huh?!

STAN
No, I don't think either of us can.


JOHN EDWARD
They told me your show is getting better
ratings than mine, that you're saying
I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better
not ever call me a liar, or a fake,
or a douche again, or else I'll sue
you for slander!

STAN
I'm saying this to you, John Edward,
you are a liar, you are a fake, and
you are the biggest douche ever!

JOHN EDWARD
Everything I tell people is positive
and gives them hope! How does that make
me a douche?!

STAN
Because the big questions in life are
tough: Why are we here? Where are we
from? Where are we going? But if people
believe in asshole douchey liars like
you, we're never gonna find the real
answer to those questions. You aren't
just lying, you're slowing down the
progress of all mankind, you douche!


JOHN EDWARD
I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you
to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to
the world that I'm psychic and you're
not!

STAN
Fine, douche!

JOHN EDWARD
I'm not a douche

[The McElroy manor, night. Kenny's spirit is now in the living
room flitting about. Thomas enters with a broom, swinging it
around to capture it somehow]

THOMAS
Well come on, the soul's in here! It
can't escape now.  It's goin' to the
light! Unfortunately, it's the livin'
room light.

NELLY
I'll open a window, you try to chase
it out, Thomas.

THOMAS
Go on now, soul now!

NELLY
Here, spirit, come out the window.
I'll give you tree-fiddy.

THOMAS
Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy,
woman!

NELLY
I'm just tryin' to persuade it.

THOMAS
Well I know, but you can at least start
at about two quarter or somethin'  Aw
Christmas, there it goes again!

NELLY
It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas,
the pot roast!

[The McElroy manor, kitchen. Kenny's spirit flits in and bounces
around the kitchen. The adults enter, hot on its trail]

THOMAS
Over here!

LIANE
Get it down.

NELLY
Don't let it get in the roast!

THOMAS
Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot
roast now.

CHEF
What do we do with it now?

NELLY
Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic
wrap so you can take it home with ya.
Should last a few months in the freezer.


CARTMAN
Hey, ah I feel a lot better.

CHEF
Eric, you're okay!

LIANE
Oh, baby, your time is back!

NELLY
This child is clean.

[The John Edward studio]

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's "Psychic
Showdown." Here are John Edward, and
Stan Marsh.

JOHN EDWARD
Thank you.  Alright, asshole! I know
you're here to try to throw me off,
so go ahead. Give my yoru best shot!


STAN
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna
talk to the audience.

JOHN EDWARD
Wah-why?

STAN
You see, I learned something today.
At first I thought you were all stupid,
listening to this douche's advice, but
now I understand that you're all here
because you're scared. You're scared
of death and he offers you some kind
of understanding. You all want to believe
in it so much, I know you do. You find
comfort in the thought that your loved
ones are floating around trying to talk
to you, but thnk about it: Is that really
what you want? To just be floating around
after you die, having to talk to this
asshole?  We need to recognize this
stuff for what it is: magic tricks.
Because whatever's really going on in
life and in death is much more amazing
than this douche.

AUDIENCE MEMBERS
Yes. Right. Yeah.

KYLE
You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't
floating around, judging me and watching
what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone
forever.

STAN
Yeah.

JOHN EDWARD
But I do have a special power! I know
I do!

STAN
There's nothing special about you, dude.
Get over yourself.

God-damnit, I'm special!!

Episode 406


"CHEROKEE HAIR TAMPONS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. But this
day, a substitute teacher enters with a bag of stuff and makes
an announcement.]

SUBSTITUTE
Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison
is away today. I am your substitute
teacher, Mr. Wyland.

CARTMAN
Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.


MR. WYLAND
Now, I understand that some students
in this class like to mess with substitute
teachers.  But if we all behave and
respect each other, I'm sure we can
make this a fun and productive day.
Let's start with roll call. Let's see,
mmmmm.  Eric Cartman?

STAN
Here!

MR. WYLAND
Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?


KENNY
(Here.)

WENDY
It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.


MR. WYLAND
Okay, and where iiiiss... Kenny McCormick?


CARTMAN
(Here.)  Oh, hoho. Ow.

STAN
Dude, what the hell was that?

CARTMAN
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're
laughin' so hard that the milk comes
out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!

STAN
...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.


CARTMAN
Huh?

STAN
You have to be drinking milk for that
to happen.

CARTMAN
Not with me, man.

MR. WYLAND
Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll
call? Here's what we're gonna do today.
I've been told that one of your classmates
has been ill for several days  Kyle
Broflovski?

STAN
He's fakin'!

MR. WYLAND
Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's
absence, our activity for the day is
to make a get-well card for Kyle. So
I got this large piece of poster board,
and we're all gonna come up and use
glitter.and glue to decorate it.

THE CLASS
Awww.

CARTMAN
He's fakin'!

MR. WYLAND
Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well
card, too.

CARTMAN
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I
hate Kyle.

MR. WYLAND
I don't care! Get down here and do it!


BUTTERS
Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'?


Get Well

Kyle

STAN
Now, that's a get-well card!

[Denver, day. The Denver School Administration building is shown.
Inside, the South Park School Board is meeting. Principal Victoria
is present among the three people seated around a horseshoe-shaped
table.]

CHAIRMAN
Mr. Garrison, after very careful review
the school board believes that you should
take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.


MR. GARRISON
What??

BOARD MEMBER
Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat
disconcerting.

CHAIRMAN
Did you know that not one of your students
knew who Sam Adams was?

MR. GARRISON
Well, who cares about a guy that makes
beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach
history!

CHAIRMAN
...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even
your educational record that we're most
concerned about.  It's your somewhat
substantial police record.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, whatever!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of
attempting to solicit sex from a minor
wa-

MR. GARRISON
That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!


BOARD MEMBER
All we're saying is, perhaps you should
take a little hiatus from teaching until
this little  "child molestation" thing
dies down a bit.

MR. GARRISON
Gentlemen, teaching is all I know.
It is the air that I breathe.

CHAIRMAN
We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no
choice.

MR. GARRISON
Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher
anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting
my badge and gun...

CHAIRMAN
Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry
a gun!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?

[Kyle's house, day, Kyle's room. He's in bed delirious and mumbling.
His door opens and in walks Sheila with Sharon and Stan.]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over
to visit you.

SHARON
Hello, sweetie.

STAN
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got
a substitute teacher.

KYLE'S MOTHER
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always
has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys
have just been shutting down.

SHARON
Well, the kids at school made you a
card, Kyle. Look.

STAN
Go on, Butters!

BUTTERS
Ho, I don't wanna!

STAN
Butters, go on!

BUTTERS
Oh, uhuh alright, then.

We're so sorry you're not feeling well.

We hope you're better soon.

So we're bringing you some sunshine

[brings out a cane and dances]

Everybody misses you

And though we hate to cause a fuss

We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"

And "Please don't die on us."

[pulls a rip cord and a bunch of ballons inflate automatically
around hin. Kyle babbles some more]

STAN
Dude, you really are sick, huh?

KYLE
I don't know, I...

KYLE'S MOTHER
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They
wanna have him go into surgery, but
they're so dangerous.

SHARON
Sheila, have you tried holistic natural
medicines? They work wonders. I read
all about in People.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Really? In People?

SHARON
There's a brand-new shop in town that
sells holistic medicines and all-natural
foods. It's run by this fascinating
woman named "Miss Information."

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information"
she must know something.

SHARON
Why don't we at least take Kyle down
there and see what she has to say.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Okay. I'll get our coats.

BUTTERS
Can I go now?

[South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Craig... oh, never
mind.]

MR. GARRISON
I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do,
Mackey. Teaching is all I know.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay, well, maybe you need to view
this as a chance to do something you've
always wanted to do.

MR. GARRISON
I've always wanted to write a novel.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well, there you go, m'kay?

MR. GARRISON
But I never know what to write about.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well that's easy. Write about what you
know. Write about what you love. What
do you love most?

MR. GARRISON
Besides teaching?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yes.

MR. GARRISON
...Poontang.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M, m'kay

MR. GARRISON
I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes,
I know, but I just think that... taking
a woman home and getting some hot poon
is about the greatest thing in the world.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison.
What you need to do is go write a great
romance novel.

MR. GARRISON
Yes, that's it.  I am going to write
the Great American Romance Novel!


Miss Information

(New Age Shop)

[The new shop. The sign is framed by two antlers and its entrance
is a curtain of beads. In the picture window you see a pyramid
with an eye on one side, a crystal ball and stand, a little elephant,
and some charms. Outside, under the window, is a bed of flowers.
Inside, Miss Information talks to Stan, Kyle, and their moms.
Kyle looks fatigued]

MISS INFORMATION
You see, the reason our body is stale
is because of toxins.

SSHEILA
Toxins?

MISS INFORMATION
All the horrible food we eatthe sodas
and meats are filled with toxins, and
the only way for us to get better is
to flush those toxins out of our system.
Western medicine is so quick to cut
and carve up, but all your son needs
is a  toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice
and cayenne pepper.

SHARON
Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!


KYLE'S MOTHER
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need
surgery after all.

STAN
Uh excuse ne, but, what do these toxins
look like?

MISS INFORMATION
What?

STAN
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?


SHARON
Don't be a smartass, Stanley.

MISS INFORMATION
Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give
your son herbs that focus on the kidney.
I have these excellent herbs from local
Native Americans.

SHARON
Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know
how to heal the body spiritually.


[Mr. Garrison's house, night. A second-story window casts a shadow
of Mr. Garrison at his laptop computer. He types...]

MR. GARRISON

Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees
went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft,
unyielding breasts

Oh yeah, now this is getting good [sips some wine]

Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.


[taps his chin with his left index finger]

His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly
ran down his

[pauses]

penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out
of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong
as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk.
What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples

[music cuts off. He thinks] Uh, let's see... [taps his chin with
his right index finger] Diana's nipples... [aloud] Oh, writer's
block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. [turns his body
to one side] Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today,
Mr. Hat.

[Kyle's house, morning. At Kyle's bedside, Sharon, Sheila, and
Liane talk to each other while Stan keeps vigil. Three other
mothers are there]

MRS. TWEEK
Oh my, he looks terrible.

BLONDE MOTHER
Yes, poor little dear.

MISS INFORMATION
Good morning, everyone.

BLONDE MOTHER
Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information.
Kyle seems to be getting worse.

MISS INFORMATION
Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems
much better.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Really?

STAN
What?

MISS INFORMATION
Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than
yesterday, and his aura is lighter.


SHARON
Oh, that's great news!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh no!

MISS INFORMATION
Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins
flushing out of the system.

SHARON
Ooooo.

STAN
Those aren't toxins. That's the been
with bacon soup he ate half an hour
ago.

SHARON
Stanley, what did I say about being
a smartass?!

STAN
Don't be a smartass?

MISS INFORMATION
Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body
sheds itself more and more of all the
toxins he will appear to be getting
worse, but actually, he is getting better!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines.
If only I had known sooner.

OTHER MOTHERS
I agree. Yeah. That's right.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Doctor is in his office filling
out a form]

NURSE
Mr. Marsh is here to see you.

DR. DOCTOR
Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley.


STAN
Hi, doctor.

DR. DOCTOR
How can I help you?

STAN
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think
he's really, really sick.

DR. DOCTOR
He is really, really sick, Stanley.
I was seeing him last week when he first
got ill, but unfortunately his mother
has decided to put all her trust intuuuh
holistic medicine..

STAN
But I don't think it's working.

DR. DOCTOR
Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very
honest with you. Your little friend
Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it
is very possible that... he will die.


STAN
Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In
the whole world.

DR. DOCTOR
I know this is a lot to lay on someone
your age, but... the rest of the town
is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that
I have nowhere else to turn.

STAN
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it
hurts a whole lot; I don't care.

DR. DOCTOR
That's very brave, Stan, but I've already
checked my records, and you and Kyle
aren't a match for kidneys. In fact,
there's only one person in South Park
with the same blood type as Kyle.


STAN
Who?  Oh, shit.

[Cartman's house, day. Cartman and Kenny are playing at dogfights
in the air, and Kenny makes sound effects while maneuvering a
yellow ship]

KENNY
(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew,
POW.)

CARTMAN
"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew,
pipipew  Give me the space cruiser,
Kenny.

KENNY
(No, no.)

CARTMAN
Come on, Kenny, you have to give me
the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy
the Gengrins on Crespus 5.

KENNY
(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!)
(There! It's mine!)

CARTMAN
No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke
your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha
ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow!

LIANE
Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard
again?

CARTMAN
Yeah.

LIANE
Well, some more of your little friends
are here to play with you.

CARTMAN
Okay, mom.

LIANE
And don't get too close to Kyle. He
looks like he might have the AIDS.


CARTMAN
What's goin' on, guys?

STAN
Cartman, we have to ask you a quuestion.
A very serious question.

CARTMAN
Oh-kay.

STAN
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see
him getting worse right before my eyes.
There might be a way that you... can save
his life.

CARTMAN
Uh huh.

STAN
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.


CARTMAN
Oh, I think I see where this is going.


STAN
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine
and New Age bullcrap on him, but its
obviously not working.

CARTMAN
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?


STAN
Alright. Will you donate one of your
kidneys to Kyle?

CARTMAN


No no, no no, no!

No no, no no, no!

STAN
But you only need one, fat boy!

CARTMAN
No no, no no, nono no!

Nonono, no no!

STAN
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh
die! Don't you see how serious this
is?!

KENNY
(Not when I try to tell him!)

CARTMAN
Well, perhaps I could see my way to
giving up a kidney. For a price.

STAN
Oh my God!

KYLE
How much?

CARTMAN
I don't know. How much is your life
worth to you, Kyle?

STAN
Cartman, you are so going to hell when
you die!

CARTMAN
Yes, well, until then, I need about
ten million dollars.

KENNY
(Ten million dollars??)

STAN
What the hell would you do with ten
million dollars, fatass?!

CARTMAN
What I intend to do with the money is
not an issue, is it? I suggest you start
looking for that money quickly. Kyle
doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.

STAN
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here.


CARTMAN
Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.
"Quick, Captain, we must destroy the
Gengrin across the fire." Give me the
space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!


[Miss Information's shop, next day. A line of folks wait to enter
the shop while a few shoppers exit with their purchases. Inside,
the shop is busy.]

MAN 1
Ooo, free-range aspirin!

MAN 2
All-natural cell phones!

MISS INFORMATION
Oh, look eveyone. These are our two
resident Native Americans. Chief Running
Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez.

MAN 3
Ooo.

MAN 4
I'd like to buy some more stuff.

MAN 5
Come in. Come here, guys.

MAN 6
Do you have any new holistic items for
sale?

CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oohh, oh yeah. Aah...  Here, uh, this
is a ahh dream...catcher.

WOMAN 1
Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one.


CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair
tampons. They're, like, tampons made
with all-natural hair from the Cherokee
people.

SHARON
Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hairnow
that sounds natural.

MISS INFORMATION
Native Americans are more in tune with
the earth than we are.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.

CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oh yeah, the earth is great.

MISS INFORMATION
Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick.
Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow
and you could give him some spiritual
healing.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll
give him, like, a, a brain enema, or
somethin'.

CARLOS RAMIREZ
uh'hm, ho ho hm.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Wonderful!

MISS INFORMATION
Why don't you follow me over to the
cash register and I'll take a deposit.


MAN 7
D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We
wanna buy more stuff.

MAN 8
Yes. Much, much more stuff.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our
truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab
some more junk.  Come on.

MISS INFORMATION
Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit
of Maya is with you.

CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oh yah. You too and junk.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
That's funny, man.

SHARON
Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you
some more all-natural toothpaste.


STAN
You mean the stuff that tastes like
ass and doesn't fight cavities?

SHARON
That's right.

STAN
Look, um... I know that you all think
the earth and its natural healing powers
can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the
hospital told me it can't.

MISS INFORMATION
Well, of course the doctor told you
that, because he wants to make money.
Holistic modicine is about NATURE.
Two-hundered and thrity-three dollars.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Everything's going to be fine, Stan.
We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see
the Native Americans personally.

STAN
Isn't it possible that these Indians
don't know what thry're talking about?


SHARON
You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native
Americans were raped of their land and
resources by white people like us!


STAN
And that has something to do with their
medicines because...?

SHARON
Enough, Stanley!

[Miss Information's shop, next day, curbside. Kenny is sitting
there. Stan exits the store, walks over to him, and sits down
next to him. Somber music plays]

STAN
Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.

KENNY
(I know.)

STAN
I don't know what else to do. I mean,
he could die, Kenny. And that means
we'd never see him again.

KENNY
(Uh huh.)

STAN
I guess maybe I've always taken friends
for granted, like they'd always be there.
If a friend died, I don't know what
I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand
here and watch my friend die. Kenny,
go round up all the kids in town who
want to help Kyle! Round them up and
meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's
gonna live!

KENNY
(Rrrh!)

[Mr. Garrison's hosue, night. He's back at his laptop. He's typing
with only his left hand now, while Mr. Hat sits on his right
hand]

MR. GARRISON

Chapter 18

Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an
erotic thought she often fantasized about.

Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!

And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help
but feel aroused.

"Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly
and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt
good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to
the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was
surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all
around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood
forest of penises.

[unconsciously, his right hand lowers down towards his crotch
and is soon out of view, but the arm moves around some...]

They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with


[catches himself in the act] Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?!
[looks around to see that no one is watching, then happily] Oh,
Mr. Hat.

[Bus stop, night. Stan waits with a book under his arm.]

STAN
Come on, where are they?

STAN
This is it??

KENNY
(Uh huh)

TIMMY
Timmiiihh!

STAN
This is everyone that wanted to help
Kyle??

BUTTERS
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but
he, he said his mom was makin' tacos
for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole
lot.

STAN
Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you
take this medical book, and everyone
follow me!

BUTTERS
Huh, where are we goin'?

STAN
We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney.


[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is asleep in his bed... tossing
and turnng]

CARTMAN
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me.
Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!

[Cartman's house, outside. Stan and the others approach, and
Stan looks in the lower window. Stan now has a hand saw on his
right hand]

STAN
Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters
are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney
out of him. Kenny, you stay here and
guard his mom's door here with Timmy.


TIMMY
Timmiihh!

STAN
Sshhh!

TIMMY
Timmiihh.

STAN
If she hears him screaming, or comes
out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?


KENNY
(Okay)

TIMMY
Timmiihh.

STAN
Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's
pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood
pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta
get outta here!  Oh, no!

BUTTERS
Oh well, we're busted.

CARTMAN
Shut up, Fluffy!

STAN
Oh, phew.

[Cartman's house, later. Cartman's nightmare returns]

CARTMAN
Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere.
They wanna save the earth, but all they
do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp!


STAN
Okay, here we go. .Okay, let's see.
Looks like if we cut here, and here...


BUTTERS
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin'
my favorite pants.

STAN
...vein right, well-  Well, here goes
nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.
No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!

CARTMAN
whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and
Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are
you?!

STAN
You suck, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Maybe so, but at least I was smart
enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!


STAN
God-damnit, don't you care that Kyle
is gonna die?!

CARTMAN
I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look.
Look how much I care.

HAREQUIN ROMANCE

BOOK PUBLISHING CO.

[Mr. Garrison has finished his novel and is now inside talking
to a publisher]

PUBLISHER
First and foemost, Mr. Garrison, I would
like to thank you for chosing Harequin
Romance

MR. GARRISON
Yeahyeahyeah. So, didi you read the
book?

PUBLISHER
Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your
book.

MR. GARRISON
Well, what did you think?

PUBLISHER
Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we
don't know if the Harequin Romance label
is appropriate for you.

MR. GARRISON
Ooohhh, why not??

PUBLISHER
Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that
the word "penis" occurs six-thousand
and eighty-three times in your novel?


MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty
words. It is a romance novel.

PUBLISHER
Nnnno, I don't think that this book
really qualifies as a "romance novel."


MR. GARRISON
No?

PUBLISHER
No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing
business like to call... gay. Really,
really gay.

MR. GARRISON
What the hell are you talkin' about?!


PUBLISHER
It's just that the focus really seems
to be on the... male organs.

MR. GARRISON
Well, I thought it was mostly women
that read these things!

PUBLISHER
It is.

MR. GARRISON
Well, women want to read about ding-dongs!
D'you thnk women care about the details
of female anatomy?! Hel-lo! Women wanna
read about big, poweful schlongs!  Look,
I've seen women read these things. They
skim along and skim along until they
get to the part about the penis! That's
what they want, so that's what I'm giving
them!

PUBLISHER
Hmmm.

[South Park, next day. Stan and Kenny sit on the curb in front
of "South Park Pianos"]

STAN
There's nothing more I can do, Kenny.
I've tried everything to save Kyle.
Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!


KENNY
(Well uh, nobody seems to care when
I die on them!)

STAN
My friend is gonna die! He's gonna
die and there's nothing I can do about
it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend...


KENNY
(Well now, that does it! I have had
enough of this bullshit! Screw you,
Stan. I'm going home!)

MOVER
Look out!  Oops.

STAN
Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again!

[South Park, Miss Information's shop, day. More people line up
to buy holistic stuff. Inside, Carlos Ramirez and Chief Running
Pinto field orders.]

WOMAN
Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.


CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
No problem, man. Pay Miss Information
up front.

MAN 7
Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain
in my balls whenever I watch VH1.


CARLOS RAMIREZ
Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is
allll-naturalll ball juice.

MAN 7
Wow, I feel better already!

MISS INFORMATION
And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's
son.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Okay, here he is.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Ahahem, that kid looks really sick.


MISS INFORMATION
Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed
again.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
No. I mean, he look REALLY sick, man.
You should take him to, like, a doctor.


CUSTOMERS
Hmm?

KYLE'S MOTHER
But you're more in touch with the earth.


CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Look, bein' in touch with the earth
has nothing to do with dyin', man.


SHARON
It's okay. We trust that you know whar
you're doing.

CARLOS RAMIREZ
No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And
besides, we're not actually Native Americans.
I mean, I'm I'm more like a, a Mexican.


CUSTOMERS
What?!

MAN
Hu-uh?!

CARLOS RAMIREZ
Yeah. A Mexican.

MAN 7
Uugh.  Ptu, ptu.

MAN 8
I didn't know that.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh my God!

SHARON
How dare you deceive us like that!


CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Hey, we never said we were Native Americans,
man. Miss Information said that.

CARLOS RAMIREZ
Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything
from Mexicans.

MISS INFORMATION
Uh, toxins ARE your enemy.

WOMAN 1
Kill her!

CARLOS RAMIREZ
Funny.

[South Park, Miss Information's shop, later. Stan, Sheila, and
Kyle are still there]

STAN
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?


KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, of course, but we don't have a
kidney donor!

STAN
That's alright. If you'll all help,
I think I have a plan.

[Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows, and Cartman's radio
sounds the alarm. Cartman rises on his bed and stretches]

CARTMAN
Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That
son of a bitch!

[Stan's house, moments later. Cartman approaches and pounds on
the door. Stan quickly opens it.]

CARTMAN
Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!


STAN
Dude, please. Kyle needs it.

CARTMAN
It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it
back right now, or there's gonna be
HELL to pay!

STAN
Alright, alright, here.

CARTMAN
Thank you. And you'd better hope to
God it still works, just like it did
before.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, some hours later. Dr. Doctor is in his
office.]

NURSE
Doctor, Eric Cartman is here-

DR. DOCTOR
Why, hello there, Eric.

CARTMAN
You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole
friend Stan took my kidney, and I need
it put back in!  Please.

DR. DOCTOR
Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that
it's already out, you don't wanna just
let your friend Kyle have it?

CARTMAN
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle,
it belongs to me! It's MINE!

DR. DOCTOR
Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped
for surgery.  If you'll just sign this
release.

CARTMAN
Thank you.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, still later. Cartman and Kyle are in the
recovery room surrounded by their parents. Stan and his parents
are there, too. Balloons, a smiley-face and two banners, "I HOPE
YOU GET BETTER!" and "GET WELL SOON", decorate Kyle's side of
the room]

KYLE'S MOTHER
How are you feeling, bubbe?

KYLE
Better, I think.

STAN
You look a lot better.

SHARON
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine
really did the trick.

KYLE
Hey, thanks for going through all that
to save my life, Stan.

STAN
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't
want you to die until I do.

CHIEF RUNNING PINTO
Yeah.  Hey, man, we're glad you're getting
better, too.

CARTMAN
Heh. Hey, what what's going on?

STAN
Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to
you!

CARTMAN
Huh?

STAN
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the
kidney blocker, and then we put catchup
on your bed so you'd think we took your
kidney.

DR. DOCTOR
Yes, but it was all a trick to get you
to come in and sign this release.


LIANE
Isn't that funny, sweetie?

CARTMAN
Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, here's everybody.

STAN
Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?


MR. GARRISON
Boys, I have an announcement to make:
I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore.
I've become a best-selling author! And
Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy
as a get-well present.

KYLE
Oh. ...Thanks?

CARTMAN
I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!


STAN
Careful, Cartman, you might pop your
stitches.

KYLE
Huh?  What the?

CARTMAN
Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.

"SOMETHING WALL-MART THIS WAY COMES"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, day. A lovely tree appears and the camera pans down
to street level. Stan and friends are on the sidewalk across
the street moving along.]

CARTMAN
You guys know what? Um, the last thing
you do when you die, is crap your pants.


STAN
...What?

CARTMAN
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release
and crap comes flying out your ass.


KYLE
That is fucking stupid, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that

MR. GARRISON
Hey everybody, it's time!  It's time!


TOWNSFOLK
It's time. Oh, it's time? It's happening.
It's happening now? Let's go!

STAN
It's time for what?

MR. GARRISON
Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about
to happen!

[Metzger's Field, later. A man is speaking to the crowd gathered
there.]

OFFICIAL
People of South Park I am pleased to
be with you on this most historic day.
A day you were certainly all remember...
as the day your town... became great.
The grand opening of the first South

RANDY
Look at it, honey. It's so big.

MR. GARRISON
It's like we're a real town now.


CARTMAN
Whoa, awesome!

KYLE
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond
used to be? Where we used to kayak and
fish?

MAN
Yeah! Now it's a Wall*Mart!

OFFICIAL
I know that with the opening of the
South Park branch of Wall*Mart, you

Now, shop friends. Shop!

RANDY
It's beautiful!

GRAMPA MARSH
Welcome to Wall*Mart. Welcome to Wall*Mart.
...Welcome to Wall*Mart.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Sharon, isn't that your father?

SHARON
Yes. Wall*Mart is the leading employer
of seniors. And they also employ the
handicapped.

JIMMY
Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g...
Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart
today?

SHARON
Why yes I'd love one, Jimmy.

CHEF
My God. Look at all these incedible
bargains.

CARTMAN
Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD.
Three copies for eighteen bucks!

KYLE
Why the hell would you want three copies
of the same movie?

CARTMAN
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight!
But this way you save like twenty bucks!


KYLE
You only need one copy, artard!

CARTMAN
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and
buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!


KYLE
Okay, fine, I will!  Huh, wait a minute!
I don't even want ONE copy of Time Cop!


CARTMAN
Dude, you can't shop for crap.

WOMAN 1
I can't believe these bargains.

OFFICIAL
Fools. Ignorant fools.

[The Marsh house, night. The living room has been redecorated
with items got from Wall*Mart. The family is enjoying snacks
in fancy plasticware]

RANDY
Just look at the Marsh family, huh?
Brand-new television, new plastic dishware
and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen
to last us a thousand winters.

STAN
Dad, how come Wall*Mart is able to sell
everything so cheap?

RANDY
It's simple economics, son. I don't
understand it at all, but, God I love
it.

[The Marsh house, later. The house is asleep; Randy is dreaming,
and reacting to his dreams.]

WHISPERS
six nienty-nine, fifteen dollars, etc.


RANDY
AAAH!  Yeaaah...

SHARON
Randy, what are you doing?

RANDY
Anu-nothing!  I'ma I'ma, I'm just gonna
head down to the Wall*Mart real quick.


SHARON
It's almost midnight.

RANDY
Yeah, think about it. If I go there
now, there won't be anybody else there.
I can all the bargains to myself!


[Wall*Mart, midnight. Randy enters dressed in pajamas and robe,
only to find more shoppers in there. Wall*Mart never closes,
and it's never empty. An elderly lady greets him]

ELDERLY WOMAN
Thanks for coming to Wall*Mart.  All
are welcome. All are welcome!

[Next morning, the boys are on a sidewalk heading towards downtown]


CARTMAN
Excuse me! Hello! Can somebody tell
my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to
buy Voltar cards when Wall*Mart has
them for three bucks cheaper?

KYLE
Dude, I can't deal with Wall*Mart right
now. My parents had me there for three
hours last night.

JIM
Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.


KYLE
Why, Mr. Farkle?

MR. FARKLE
I can't compete with Wall*Mart's low
prices. Everyone is shopping there now,
and... well, I can make ends meet.
I've got to sell the store and try to
find another line of work.

KYLE
Cartman, stop it!

CARTMAN
What? I just felt like playing a little
violin, Kyle.

MR. FARKLE
I appreciate your business, boys, but
you'll have to try somewhere else in
town.

KYLE
See? That sucks, dude!

CARTMAN
That's called progress, Kyle.

KYLE
Yeah, but what about all the people
getting laid off from the grocery stores?
And what about all the-

CARTMAN
... Whatever. I can go get another one
at Wall*Mart. It was only five bucks.


STAN
Come on, let's go to Main Street and
support one of those stores.

[Downtown, later. The boys arrive at Main Street and are startled]


KYLE
What the hell?

STAN
Butters?

KYLE
Butters? Uh what the hell are you doing?


BUTTERS
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's
kinda spooky out here.

STAN
Dude, we gotta show our parents what
Wall*Mart is doing to our town.

[The Marsh house, later. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny enter to find
a house stuffed with Wall*Mart items.]

STAN
Dad?  Jesus Christ, Dad. Dad??

RANDY
So-o-o-o-on?

STAN
Dad, oh my God!

RANDY
Son...

STAN
What? D-dad, are are you dying?

RANDY
No, I'm just... really really tired.
I... was shopping at Wall*Mart all night.


STAN
But you-your face!

RANDY
Checkout line... They had these... little
stickers filled with glitter! They were
only ninety nine cents for 15 of them.
I couldn't resist! Do you want one?
Here. It's a little turtle.

[Wall*Mart, later. Shopping continues as usual. In his office,
the official, now store manager, reaches into his desk drawer
and pulls out a bottle of liquor. He takes two sips and quickly
hides it when he hears a knock at his door]

MANAGER
Come in?  Oh hello, fine shoppers.


CHEF
Sir, we just had a big town meeting,
and decided we don't want your Wall*Mart
here anymore.

RANDY
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street
is dying and good people are losing
their jobs. We'd all like you... out
of South Park.

MANAGER
Well  What? What, you think I want to
be here? I hate this place. But it...
won't let me leave.

KYLE
But you run the Wall*Mart.

MANAGER
Oh you're wrong!  Wall*Mart... isn't
run by anybody! First it reels you in
with its bargains. Next thing you know
you, you're workingbe at the Wall*Mart
because it has all the jobs. Then you're
sitting in a little office, trapped
on all sides.

CHEF
They why don't you just quit?!

MANAGER
Not so loud! It can hear you.

KYLE
You hate Wall*Mart too?

MANAGER
ACK!  I didn't say that! I love Wall*Mart!
With all its... fantastic bargains and
one-stop shopping, who can't love it,
right?  Uh, Wa-Wall*Mart takes the hassle
out of shopping and, and makes it both
affordable and fun.  Ah- and Wall*Mart
really gives back to the community!
Us people are certainly happy to have
a store like Wall*Mart, aren't we?


RANDY
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just
got squirreled.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can
get us to go away by being so goofy!


CARTMAN
Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!

[The Marsh house, night. The family is at table waiting for dinner.
Sharon walks in with ]

SHARON
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice
steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll
have to share them.

RANDY
Eh, I remember when we could afford
to buy six steaks when we shopped at
Wall*Mart.

STAN
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed
not to shop at Wall*Mart anymore.


RANDY
I know, I KNOW! GOD!!  BLEHH!

STAN
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always
crap their-

SHELLEY
Oh, you stupid turd!

RANDY
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't
see any choice now! We have to go to
Wall*Mart!

SHARON
We do?

RANDY
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new
glass at this hour?! Everyone get your
shoes on, we're goin' to Wall*Mart!


STAN
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop
at-

RANDY
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't
gonna make a difference!

[Wall*Mart, night. The Marsh family arrives and sees what Randy
saw before]

RANDY
Hey...  Gerald, what are you doing?!
We said we weren't going to shop at
the Wall*Mart anymore!

KYLE'S FATHER
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin
dispenser at nine thirty at night?


RANDY
Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come
on people! What the hell is wrong with
you?! Don't you see what you're all
doing?!

MR. GARRISON
Well what are you doing here, Randy?


RANDY
I came because I wanted to make sure
nobody was shopping here.

STAN
Dad!

RANDY
Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy
a glass. One glass! ... And some chips...
And butter.  And some new pliers.


KYLE'S FATHER
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like
the Wall*Mart, but we can't stop coming
here.

JIMBO
It's like some mystical evil force.


RANDY
Yeah. This place has a power over us
we can't resist! We have to find a way
to put the South Park Wall*Mart out
of business once and for all!

MR. GARRISON
Let's burn it down!

CHEF
No no no! Let's freeze it!

STEPHEN
I think it's best we try to reason with
it.

KYLE
No! All we have to do is not shop at
Wall*Mart anymore! If you want it to
go away, all it takes is a little self-control
and personal responsibility.

[Outside, later. The Wall*Mart is on fire and the shoppers are
watching it burn]

RANDY
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.

ALL
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya,
my Lord...

[Sidewalk, next day. The boys are walking along]

CARTMAN
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to
go and ruin everything, didn't you?


KYLE
It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall*Mart
down.

CARTMAN
No, but YOU got everyone all worked
up! You're jealous of the Wall*Mart.
You always hated it.

KYLE
Dude, our town is going to be better
without the-  What the?

CARTMAN
Oh, awesome!

KYLE
How... How did this happen?  Mom, Dad?
Why are you shopping here?

KYLE'S FATHER
We can't destroy it, son. We have to
learn to live with it.

A MAN
Can I help you?

STAN
Dad, what are you doing?!

RANDY
You get a discount working here. Ten
percent. That means the bargains are
even better.

STAN
Dad, you're a geologist!

RANDY
I'll make less money, sure, but... as
long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart,
it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall*Mart
isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood
friend.

[Outside. The boys walk away from Wall*Mart and see a driver
lifting I-beams into place with his crane]

KYLE
Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to
put this thing back up?!

DRIVER
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate
headquarters.

KYLE
But nobody wants a Wall*Mart here!


DRIVER
You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.


STAN
Where are they?

DRIVER
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where
Wall*Mart started, that's where all
the bigwigs are.

KYLE
Looks like we're gonna have to go to
Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna
put a stop to Wall*Mart once and for
all!

CARTMAN
Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine cents?
Wall*Mart? ...Are you speaking to me?
...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you
again?  Yes, Wall*Mart. I understand.


[Coyote Lines, night. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the ticket
booth]

STAN
Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas,
please.

CARTMAN
Wait guys! Hold on! I wanna go with
you and help out.

KYLE
No way! You wanna go with us so you
can betray us at some point and keep
us from destroying the Wall*Mart.


CARTMAN
Nuh uh.

KYLE
Yeah huh! You wanna go with us so that
later you go, "Haha, I was working for
Wall*Mart all along" or something.


CARTMAN
I AM NOT, Kyle!

STAN
Dude, just let him come. The bus is
about to leave.

KYLE
All right, fine. Come on, fatass!


CARTMAN
Haha. You fools have no idea that I
wuold never let you hurt the Wall*Mart.


KYLE
I heard that!

CARTMAN
You heard what?

KYLE
You said we have no idea that you're
never let us hurt Wall*Mart!

CARTMAN
That's not what I said!

STAN
Dude, come on!

KYLE
He is working for the Wall*Mart to stup
us from succeeding!

STAN
Dude, we have to go!

KYLE
God-damnit!

STAN
Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!


CARTMAN
Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea
that I'm actually working for the Wall*Mart
to stup you from succeeding!

Welcome to Bentonville, Home of Wall*Mart

[A bus pulls up to the store's headquarters and lets the four
boys off]

STAN
Goddamn that took a long time.

KYLE
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't
slashed the tires!

CARTMAN
I did not! I wanna close Wall*Mart
just as much as you guys do!

[Corporate Headquarters, inside. A cavernous warehouse opens
up before them, with busy workers, and a receptionist greets
them]

RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?

KYLE
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't
want a Wall*Mart in our town.

RECEPTIONIST
Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall*Mart
does, but it keeps... right on doing
it.

KYLE
We want to talk to who's in charge.


RECEPTIONIST
In charge? I guess that would be Harvey
Brown. He's the current president of
Wall*Mart. One of the original creators.


STAN
Where's he?

[An ashtray. A hand rubs spent cigarette butts into it. The camera
pulls out to reveal the president and the boys, and lots of empty
glasses of liquor.]

HARVEY BROWN
We... invented the Wall*Mart Super Center
in 1987. The idea was simple: build
a store for one-stop shopping where
bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly
low.  We didn't know what we were doing.
In just four years, it was out of control.


KYLE
So how do we stop it?

HARVEY BROWN
You don't stop it.

STAN
There has to be a way!

HARVEY BROWN
There's nothing! Don't you understand?!
Nothing can stop the Wall*Mart in your
town! ...Unless...of course, you can
find and destroy its heart.

KYLE
The heart of Wall*Mart?

CARTMAN
Sir, don't you think you're talking
a little too much?

HARVEY BROWN
Every Wall*Mart has a heart, somewhere
near the television department. Destroy
the heart and you could reverse the
entire process!

CARTMAN
You speak too much, sir!

STAN
Why don't you guys just destroy the
heart?

HARVEY BROWN
Because the Wall*Mart stops you. Many
have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature
activists, even the best fair-trade
lawyers tried to stop the Wall*Mart
and now? They are Wall*Mart shoppers
all.

KYLE
All right. Come on you guys, we have
to get back home.

HARVEY BROWN
It won't work, don't you understand?!
It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing
but Wall*Mart left! Jesus, what did
we do?? WHAT DID WE DO??  Boys!  Tell
the world... Im sorry!

STAN
No, dude, don't!

CARTMAN
That's ten bucks you owe me, dickface!


[A stormy night in front of Wall*Mart. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny
arrive dressed in camouflage.]

KYLE
All right, this is it! If Wall*Mart
has a heart, we have to find it and
destroy it! No matter what the Wall*Mart
does to try to stop us, we have to be
strong! Let's do it.

CARTMAN
I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall*Mart is
a great store! I could not let you fools
ruin its terrific bargains! You see,
I was working for Wall*Mart all along!


KYLE
I knew you were!

CARTMAN
No you didn't.

KYLE
Yes I did! I said from the beginning
that you would do this!

CARTMAN
No you didn't.

KYLE
Yes I did!!

CARTMAN
No you didn't.

KYLE
Yes I did!!

CARTMAN
No you didn't.

KYLE
Yes I did!!

CARTMAN
No you didn't.

KYLE
Yes I did!!

CARTMAN
... You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed
the bu-

KYLE
-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas!
I said so! I told you the minute that
I-  -and I told you that-

CARTMAN
I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm
sorry, boys. but if you want to hurt
the Wall*Mart, you'll have to go through
me!

KYLE
We don't have time for this! Kenny,
keep him away from us!

CARTMAN
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  No,
Kenny. Kenny! Knock it off.

[Stan and Kyle enter the store and walk past the greeterm Marvin
Marsh.]

GRANDPA MARSH
Welcome to Wall*Mart.

STAN
Save it, Grandpa!

KYLE
We've gotta find the television department.


RANDY
Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.


STAN
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall*Mart.


RANDY
Shhhhh! What are you talking about?


STAN
One of the creators told us. You have
to take your keys over to the television
department.

RANDY
Television department... All right,
come on, let's go!  Oh my God!

STAN
What?!

RANDY
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers!
They were three dollars five minutes
ago! The Wall*Mart is lowering its prices
trying to stop us!

STAN
Come on, we've got to try to make it
to the back!

RANDY
Gaaahh! Don't look! Don't look at its
bargains!

KYLE
I think I see the television department
in the back!

STAN
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad??  Dad!


RANDY
The screwdrivier set is only nine ninety-eight!


STAN
Come on, Dad!

RANDY
I can't make it, boys! You're gonna
have to go on without me!

STAN
No, dad! We need your keys!

RANDY
This bargain is too great for me! I'm
gonna have to buy these! Here! Take
the keys and go on!  The television
department is near the back! Next to
the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna
go buy these screwdrivers!

STAN
There! The television department!


[The television department. The wall is lined with TVs of all
sizes. A hand appears and presses a button, and all the TVs turn
on, showing the boys on screen. The camera pans over to the two
boys, who are looking at a man dressed in white.]

MAN
Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting
this far.

KYLE
Who are you?

MAN
I am... Wall*Mart.

STAN
You?

WALL*MART
I've taken this form in order to talk
to you. But I can take many forms.
Does this suit you better? Or perhaps
you prefer this form?  I can take whichever
form I like.

STAN
We don't want your store in our town;
we come to destroy you.

KYLE
Where's the heart?

WALL*MART
To find the heart of Wall*Mart, one
must first ask oneself, "Who is it that
asked the question?"

STAN
Mr. I'm asking the question.

WALL*MART
Ah, yes, but who are you?

STAN
Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?


WALL*MART
Ah. You know the answer, but not the
question!

KYLE
The question is, "Where is the heart?"


WALL*MART
Very well. You want to see the heart
of Wall*Mart? It lies beyond that plasna-screen
television.

STAN
It's a mirror.

WALL*MART
Yes, don't you see? That is the heart
of Wall*Mart. You, the consumer. I take
may forms: Wall*Mart, Kay*Mart, Target,
but I am one single entity: Desire!


STAN
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy
the heart.

WALL*MART
Gaaah! NO! NO, what have you done??
Now you shall see my true form!  Now
you see me as I truly am!

STAN
We'd better get out of here.

CHEF
Get out! It's gonna blow!

STAN
Hey, come on! We've gotta get out!


RANDY
Too late for me, son! I have to buy
this stuff!

KYLE
The Wall*Mart is exploding! Everybody
out now!

[Outside on the parking lot, night. The building begins to collapse
as everyone gathers in the parking lot. The building implodes
into a shining blue dot, then reappears as crap, which falls
to the ground where the Wall*Mart once stood. Cartman looks on
in astonishment, then cracks up and walks away]

MR. GARRISON
Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall*Mart!


KYLE'S FATHER
How did you do it, Kyle?

KYLE
All Wall*Marts start a self-destruction
sequence if you break a mirror in the
back.

CHEF
We know how to destroy it now. Spread
the word to all the towns!

RANDY
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism
of the mirror. The Wall*Mart... is us.


KYLE
Duh.

RANDY
You see boys, if we like our small-town
charm more than the big corporate bullies,
we all have to be willing to... pay
a little bit more. Do you understand?


KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs
down the street!

[Jim's Drugs, later. He reopens for business and the crowd flocks
to his store. Later, the small store is replaced by a larger
two-story building, which in turn is replaced by a huge building
reminiscent of the departed Wall*Mart, which in turn leads to
Jim's Drugs' demise by fire]

CROWD
...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.

RANDY
All right, let's not make that mistake
again.

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, lets all shop over at Tru-Value!


CROWD
Let's go! Yeah!

"DEATH"

by

Matt Stone & Trey Parker



ACT I

INT. STANS HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Stan's Family (Father, sister and Grandfather) are seated at
a table. Mother walks up holding a birthday cake with a
ridiculous number of number of candles.

STAN & FAMILY
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday
to you! Happy birthday dear grandpa!

Grandpa drools a little from his wheelchair.

STAN & FAMILY
Happy birthday to you!

STAN'S MOTHER
Now blow out the candles grandpa!

Grandpa manages the smallest wheeze, which doesn't even make
the flames of the candles flicker.

Stan's family members all applaud.

STAN'S FATHER
How does it feel to be a hundred and
two, paps?

GRANDPA
Shoot me.

STAN'S MOM
Make a wish grandpa!

GRANDPA
I wish I were dead.

FATHER
Ha, ha! That's our silly grandpa!

GRANDPA
I'm not being silly! Kill me! I'd do
it myself, but I'm too damn old!

STAN'S MOM
Oh, who wants ice cream with their
cake?

STAN
I will.

FATHER
Me.

Stan looks up and the clock and gasps.

STAN
It's eight o'clock! My favorite T.V.
show is on!

SHELLEY
That show's for babies, it's so
stupid!

STAN
Can I eat my cake in the living room,
mom? Please? Can I?

STAN'S MOM
Oh, alright. But take your grandpy
with you.

STAN
Aw, dammit.

STAN'S MOM
Language!

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Stan is sitting on the couch watching television and eating
cake.

NARRATOR
And now back to Terrance and Phillip!

ANGLE - TELEVISION

Two average looking teens (animated in a slightly different
style) are sitting on a couch.

PHILLIP
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.

Stan laughs.

TERRANCE
Wait! before you do, Pull my thumb.

Phillip pulls Terrance's thumb. Terrance FARTS loudly.

The laugh track laughs. Stan laughs.

PAN OVER to reveal grandpa, who is trying to point a shotgun
at his head.

Grandpa pulls the trigger -- BLAM!! He misses, blowing a
picture of the wall.

GRANDPA
Aw Dammit!!

Grandpa looks at Stan.

GRANDPA
How would you like to make a dollar,
Billy?

STAN
My name's not Billy, grandpa, it's
Stan.

GRANDPA
Dammit, Billy! Do you want a dollar
or don't ya?!

STAN
Sure.

GRANDPA
Okay, you just have to do one thing
for me...

STAN
I'm not going to kill you, grandpa.

GRANDPA
WHY NOT?!

STAN
'Cause! I'll get in trouble!

GRANDPA
I killed my grandpa when I was your
age!

STAN
Leave me alone, grandpa.

GRANDPA
What has America's youth come to?!
Kids won't even kill their own
grandparents!!

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kyle is sitting in front of the T.V. watching the same T.V.
show.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

PHILLIP
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted,
I think I might fart too!

Phillip leans over and rips a big one. The laugh track laughs.

TERRANCE
Ooh! You farted!

The laugh track laughs again.

Kyle laughs painfully. He holds his stomach. Just then, Kyle's
mother walks in.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle boopie, What are you watching?

But Kyle is laughing too hard to speak. His mother looks at
the television.

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?

PHILLIP
I sure would Terrance.

TERRANCE
Alrighty then, here's a Tulip PUUU!!
Terrance farts.

RESUME - KYLE AND MOTHER

Kyle is rolling around on the floor laughing wildly.

KYLE'S MOTHER
What is this? It's horrible!

KYLE
(Collecting himself)
Dude, it's 'Terrance and Phillip'.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

PHILLIP
Take that you stupid dick!

KYLE'S MOTHER
WHAT did he say?!

TERRANCE
You're an asshole, Phillip!

KYLE'S MOTHER
What-what-WHAAAATT?

Kyle's mom snaps the T.V. off.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Young man, you are not to watch that
show anymore! It's immature toilet
humor!

KYLE
But EVERYBODY watches Terrance &
Phillip!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, really, is that SO?!

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

Cartman is on the couch eating cheesy poofs and watching
television.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

Terrance and Phillip are floating out in space.

TERRANCE
Oh no, Phillip! looks like you're
about to fart!

PHILLIP
You're exactly right, Terrance!!

A huge FART sound. Cartman laughs wildly.

CARTMAN
Sweet!

CARTMAN'S MOM
Eric dear, I just got a call from
your friend Kyle's mother. She said
that this show is naughty, and might
make you a potty mouth.

CARTMAN
That's a bunch of crap. Kyle's mom
is a dirty jew.

CARTMAN'S MOM
Oh, okay hon.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

Stan walks up to his bedroom door and looks at his list of
chores. 'Take Out Trash' followed by 'Feed Sparky' then 'clean
up room' and then, sloppily scribbled in crayon, 'Kill
Grandpa'.

Stan looks confused, then realizes that grandpa is down the
hall.

STAN
I'm not going to kill you, grandpa!

Grandpa appears in the background.

GRANDPA
Ingrate!

STAN
G'night grandpa.

Stan goes into his room.

GRANDPA
You pompous son of a whore!

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The kids are filing into their desks.

Kyle gets into his desk, and immediately gets slugged in the
head by Cartman.

KYLE
OW! What the hell was that for?!

CARTMAN
That's for your stupid mother! She
made me miss Terrance and Phillip
last night!

CLYDE
Yeah, what's the big idea having
your mom call all our moms last night?

KYLE
Well, I didn't have her do it, she
did it on her own!

CARTMAN
Why does this happen every month? It
seems like right about the same time
every month Kyle's mom gets a hair
up her ass about something -- and I
always end up getting screwed by it!

Mr. Garrison steps in front of the class.

MR. GARRISON
Children, children, a certain
student's mother called me last
night...

CARTMAN
Oh gee, I wonder whose mother THAT
could have been!

MR. GARRISON
She informed me that some of you
might be watching a naughty show
called 'Terrance and Phillip'.

The whole class smiles and cheers.

CLASS
YEAH!

MR. HAT
Watching that show is bad, Mr.
Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
That's right, Mr. Hat, shows like
Terrance and Phillip are what we
call 'toilet humor'. They don't expand
your minds.

The kids blink.

MR. GARRISON
You see, children, these kind of
shows are senseless, vile trash.

Kenny walks in.

MR. GARRISON
Kenny, why are you late to class?

Kenny says nothing, but just hands Mr. Garrison a note.

ANGLE - NOTE

'Please excuse me from being late. I have explosive diarrhea'.

RESUME - GARRISON

MR. GARRISON
Oh. Okay, Kenny. Be seated.

Kenny walks to his desk.

MR. GARRISON
Now, as I was saying, the reason
that parents of South Park are so
upset is because you -- yes Kenny,
what is it?

Kenny has his hand raised.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm.

MR. GARRISON
I thought you just came from the
bathroom.

KENNY
Mph rm rmph rm mph mph rm rm mm.

MR. GARRISON
Oh okay, okay, go ahead.

Kenny walks into a little bathroom.

MR. GARRISON
As I was saying, you all seem to
enjoy this show, even though it isn't
based in reality. There is much more
to life than two young men farting
on each other.

Suddenly, we HEAR the sounds of splashing water and explosive
diarrhea.

MR. GARRISON
And throughout history there have
always been shows that have come and
gone that have been very bad. Usually
they get taken right off the air.
You see you should be spending your
time enlightening your mind with
more intelligent entertainment.

Kenny walks out of the bathroom and takes his seat again.

STAN
Whew! Smells like you slaughtered a
cow in there, Kenny!

MR. GARRISON
Pay attention, children! I'm going
to join your parents in requesting
that you don't watch Terrance and
Phillip anymore, ever.

CARTMAN
WHAT?!

CLYDE
Not watch Terrance and Phillip EVER?

MR. GARRISON
That's right, children, are there
any questions?
(Pause)
Yes, Stanly?

STAN
Is it okay to kill somebody if they
want you to?

Garrison is taken aback.

MR. GARRISON
What do you mean?

STAN

The whole class sits and thinks.

STAN
My grandpa keeps asking that I kill
him all the time, and sometimes I
wonder if I should.

KYLE
Well then you should. I think that a
person has a right to die if they
wanna.

STAN
Really?

KYLE
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack
Laborkian that goes around and murders
people that ask him to, and he doesn't
get in trouble at all.

STAN
Wow.

CARTMAN
Hey! Maybe we could get him to kill
Kyle's mom!

STAN
So IS it okay to assist somebody
with suicide, Mr. Garrison?

Mr. Garrison thinks.

MR. GARRISON
Uh, Stan... I'm not touching that
one with a twenty foot pole.

Stan looks bummed.

KENNY
Mph mph mph!!!

Kenny dashes to the bathroom, slams the door, and let's go
of horrible, explosive diarrhea.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #1

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The boys are in line for lunch.

CARTMAN
Man, I can't believe we're gonna
miss Terrance and Phillip today! I
think I'm already having withdrawal!

Cartman starts shaking and quivering uncontrollably.

STAN
Don't worry, dude. We can all go
watch it at my house! My parents
don't get home until late.

KYLE
But won't your grandpa be there?

STAN
Yeah...

CARTMAN
Just kill him, dude, maybe he'll
give you some money.

CHEF
Hello there, children!

STAN
Hey Chef.

CHEF
How's it going?

STAN
Bad.

CHEF
Why bad?

STAN
Chef, Is it okay to kill your grandpa?

CHEF
You can't kill my grandpa, Stan,
he's already passed on.

STAN
No I mean kill MY grandpa.

CHEF
No I don't think that's okay, Stan.
In fact I think that's illegal.

STAN
See, I told you, dude.

KYLE
Well yeah, but what if the grandpa
wants to die, 'cause he's really
old, and he's just asking for help?

CARTMAN
Yeah, like assisted suicide, what
about that?

Chef thinks again.

CHEF
I don't want to touch that with a
forty-foot pole.

Chef runs away.

They boys just sit there and blink.

STAN
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody
talk about this?

INT. PTA MEETING - DAY

A large group of parents have gathered in a small meeting
hall. Kyle's mother is at the head of the group, speaking at
a podium.

KYLE'S MOTHER
...and I myself was not aware of
this outrageous, horrible show until
recently. I have a clip of this show
to demonstrate exactly what I mean.

Kyle's mom hits a button of a remote. A video image of
Terrance and Phillip starts.

ANGLE - TELEVISION SCREEN

TERRANCE
Hey, Phillip, guess what?

PHILLIP
What?

FARRRRRRT...

The clip ends.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Now, apparently that's supposed to
be FUNNY.

Laughing is heard from the back of the room. CUT TO Stan's
Father, who is giggling to himself.

STAN'S DAD
Ha, ha... He farted right on his
head!

The other parents look at Stan's dad, disgusted.

Kyle's mom sighs.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Not allowing our kids to watch this
show is not enough. We need to BOYCOTT
THE ENTIRE NETWORK!! ALL THOSE IN
FAVOR?!

Hands bolt up into the air.

Suddenly, violent poo sounds emerge from the toilet.

Mr. Garrison steps out.

MR. GARRISON
Ooh, I think I've caught a touch of
flu from little Kenny this morning.
I've got the green apple splatters.

Some of the men in the audience laugh.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

Stan walks in the door followed by the other boys.

Grandpa is sitting in his wheelchair trying to stick a fork
into a light socket.

STAN
Hi, Grandpa. I brought my friends
over to watch T.V. if that's okay.

GRANDPA
Billy, help grandpa stick this fork
in the outlet.

STAN
No Grandpa, I'll get in trouble!

GRANDPA
Kill me God damnit!

STAN
No! I can't even kill a deer!

GRANDPA
Well then have one of your little
friends do it!!
(To Cartman)
You can kill me, can't you?

CARTMAN
I would never kill somebody -- not
unless they pissed me off.

GRANDPA
Oh, is that a fact? Well, let me
tell you something, Porky, your mom
was over here earlier and I humped
her like a little bitch.

CARTMAN
WHAT?!

GRANDPA
That's right.

STAN
GRANDPA!!

GRANDPA
And then I dug up your great grandma's
skeleton and had my way with her
too! Choice piece of ass, your great
grandma!!

CARTMAN
HEY! YOU PIECE OF CRAP! I'LL KILL
YOU!!

GRANDPA
That's the spirit, Tubby!!

STAN
Come on, Cartman, he's just trying
to get to you!

Stan grabs Cartman and pulls him away.

CARTMAN
Don't talk about my mom like that!!

STAN
We can go watch Terrance and Phillip
in the kitchen.

GRANDPA
(Calling after him)
I ever tell you 'bout the time I
boofed your dad, fatso?

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

The boys are standing next to a small T.V. set and a phone.
Cartman is still fuming.

CARTMAN
I can't believe that son of a bitch!

STAN
Here, Cartman, have some snacky cakes.

CARTMAN
(Suddenly fine)
Ooh, snacky cakes? Good deal...

Cartman starts to gorge himself.

STAN
I don't know what to do, dude. My
Grandpa really wants to die.

KYLE
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe
you should ask the Lord for guidance.

STAN
Hey yeah, good idea.

Stan picks up the phone.

INT. JESUS AND PALS SET

NARRATOR
And now back to 'Jesus and Pals' on
South Park Public Access.

JESUS
Yea, believe in me and ye shall find
peace. ...First caller, you're on
Jesus and Pals.

VOICE
Yeah, is this Jesus?

JESUS
Yes, caller, you need to turn your
T.V. down, that's why you're getting
that weird feedback.

VOICE
Oh sorry... Uh, this is Mar --

JESUS
Martin from Aspen Park, yes I know.

VOICE
...How the hell did you know that?

JESUS
Well, maybe because I'm the son of
God, brainiac, now do you have a
question?

VOICE
Oh yeah, uh, I have this cousin who
cheated on the SAT's to --

JESUS
Tell little Gregory that cheating is
lying and lying is wrong, no matter
what the circumstance.

VOICE
Oh, Okay, thanks for the advice,
Jesus.

JESUS
Next caller, you're on the air.

STAN
Jesus?

JESUS
Yes my son.

STAN
Jesus, is it okay to kill somebody
if they ask you to because they're
in a lot of pain? You know, like
assisted suicide. Is that okay?

JESUS
My son...

STAN
Yes?

JESUS
I'm not touching that with a sixty
foot pole.

Jesus QUICKLY reaches over and switches phone lines.

JESUS
Next caller --

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

STAN
GOD DAMMIT!!

JESUS
I heard that.

STAN
What the hell is wrong with
everybody?!

CARTMAN
Hey you guys! 'Terrance and Phillip'

STAN
Yeah!

Stan starts to change the channel.

KYLE
Hey, do you think we'll get in trouble
for watching it?

STAN
Kyle, don't be a butthole!

CARTMAN
Yeah, just 'cause your mom is a stupid
bitch doesn't mean the whole world
has to suffer.

KYLE
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Oh, Bitch... your mom is a Bitcha
Bitcha Bitch...

ANGLE - TELEVISION

ANNOUNCER
And now back to Terrance & Phillip.

The two very plain looking teens are sitting on a couch.

TERRANCE
Hey Philip, would you like to eat
some beans?

PHILLIP
Oh yeah! I love beans!

RESUME - KITCHEN

CARTMAN
(Laughing)
Oh oh... I bet I know what's coming!

Grandpa wheels himself in and nonchalantly hands Stan a piece
of rope.

GRANDPA
Billy, would you mind holding this
for grandpa, please?

Stan doesn't take his eyes off the T.V.

STAN
Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of
the way of the T.V.

Stan takes the rope. Grandpa heads to the background.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, it looks like those
beans might make me fart!

PHILLIP
Well, don't fart on me, Terrance!

RESUME - LIVING ROOM

The boys all laugh merrily. Meanwhile, Grandpa is doing
something odd in the background.

He is throwing the other end of the rope around a crossbeam.

KYLE
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head
again!!

Suddenly, Kenny jumps up and rushes to the bathroom. We HEAR
a door SLAM and then the sounds of splashing water and
explosive diarrhea.

KENNY
Mmmf Mrph mamm Mrmmm!

CARTMAN
Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny!

A fart sound comes from the T.V. The boys all break out
laughing hysterically.

PHILLIP
You're such an ASSHOLE Terrance!!

TERRANCE
Ha Ha charade I am.

The boys laugh even harder.

CARTMAN
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna miss
the fart!!

Just then, Shelley walks in!

SHELLEY
JESUS CHRIST! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING?!?!

Stan jumps up and stands in front of the T.V.

STAN
We're not watching Terrance and
Phillip, I swear! I mean... CARTMAN
was watching it.

SHELLEY
No, I mean what the HELL ARE YOU
DOING TO GRANDPA?!

Stan looks down at the rope in his hand, then follows it up
over a crossbeam, and finally sees grandpa at the other end,
hanging by the neck.

GRANDPA
(Choking)
Tug... a... little... harder...
Billy...

STAN
AGH!

Stan lets go of the rope and grandpa crashes to the ground.

SHELLEY
You little jerk, you were trying to
kill grandpa!! I'm telling mom!!

GRANDPA
(Coughing)
Dammit, I was so close!

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

viciously murder an innocent,
grandfather.

INT. STUDIO - DAY

The boys are on some kind of talk show.

REPORTER
Boys, how did you get driven so far
to the edge? What changed you into
such demonic little bastards?

STAN
We didn't know what we were doing.
We were just sitting there watching
'Terrance and Phillip' and --

REPORTER
Terrance and Phillip!! Ah HA!!! SO
it IS that show that is to blame!

EXT. SOUTH PARK

Kyle's mother is standing in front of the town with yet
another reporter.

KYLE'S MOTHER
These boys' minds have been tainted
by the garbage on television that
they see, and we are FED UP!

A random TOWNSPERSON holds his stomach and runs into a
bathroom where thundering shit sounds emerge.

Garrison runs up to the bathroom door and pounds on it.

KYLE'S MOTHER
We have to stop this smut from going
on the air! We will march to the
network and PROTEST UNTIL OUR DEMANDS
ARE MET!! NEW YORK, HERE WE COME!!!

The parents all cheer.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #2

Within the city, a mob is gathered out front of the towering
skyscraper of Cartoon Central. Kyle's mother stands in front
of the crowd with a bullhorn, addressing the crowd.

KYLE'S MOTHER
We are spreading the word to this
establishment -- That we DEMAND better
television for our children!

The people cheer.

KYLE'S MOTHER
We want more QUALITY television like
'Full House'!!

Several of the South Park residents, however, are waiting in
line for one of the two port-o-pottys.

STAN'S FATHER
Ooh, I think you gave me the stomach
flu, Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
No, no, it was that little Kenny
bastard that gave it to me.

Mayor McDaniels steps out.

STAN'S DAD
Whoa, Mayor, you making gravy in

MAYOR MCDANIELS
I just had a brown baby boy!

They all laugh, in spite of themselves.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

The boys are running around the house like crazy. Garbage
and food is everywhere.

KYLE
Dude! This is SWEET not having any
parents around!

STAN
Yeah! I hope they protest T.V. shows
forever!

The boys start jumping up and down on the sofa.

STAN
WHOOPEE!!!!

GRANDPA
Come here, Billy, I want to show you
something...

STAN
Aw, do I have to?

GRANDPA
Yes you do you little pecker!

Stan sighs and follows his grandfather.

GRANDPA
I realized that the reason you won't
kill me, is because you don't
understand how I feel, Billy.

They walk to one of the bedroom doors.

GRANDPA
But I found out a way to show YOU
what it feels like to be grandpa.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM

Grandpa leads Stan into a little bedroom and closes the door,
locking both himself and Stan inside.

STAN
Hey, what are you doing?

Grandpa hits a switch, and the lights in the room go out.

Stan tries to look around the dark room.

Grandpa reaches down and puts a tape into a tape player.

EXT. STAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY

The other boys have their ears pinned against the door.

KYLE
What are they doing in there?

CARTMAN
I don't know...

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM

GRANDPA
Now, you're about to see what it's
like to be as old as me. Are you
ready Billy?

STAN
I guess.

Grandpa flips the switch on the tape player. A slow ENYA
Song begins to play.

ENYA
(Singing)
Take a look, take a look...

As the song continues, Stan is forced to just sit in the
dark room and listen to it.

Finally, Stan grabs the doorknob, but its locked.

STAN
Okay, you can let me out now.

GRANDPA
Not just yet.

Grandpa turns the song up louder. Stan pulls on the door.

STAN
LET ME OUT, GRANDPA!!

The song gets even louder still.

STAN
I can't take it anymore! This music
is terrible!! It's cheesy but lame
and eerily soothing at the same time!!

GRANDPA
THAT'S IT!!!! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE TO BE GRANDPA!!!!

EXT. STAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY

Grandpa opens the door. Stan falls out, looking terrible and
beaten.

Grandpa flips off the Enya music, and goes over to Stan.

STAN
Grandpa... I... I had no idea how
bad it was for you... Now I
understand...

GRANDPA
So now will you kill me, Billy?

STAN
Sure I will grandpa... I will.

EXT. TOON CENTRAL

The people of South Park are still gathered around South
Park, only now, they have chained themselves to the building.

STAN'S MOM
It doesn't look like our protest is
working.

KYLE'S MOM
It'll work... It has to...

Suddenly, a well dressed businessman emerges from the doors
of the building.

KYLE'S MOM (CONT'D)
Look! It's the president of the
network!!

JOHN WARSOG
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
John Warsog. I have prepared a
statement for you on behalf of the
network...

The people all stand up. Warsog puts on glasses and pulls a
piece of paper out of his pocket.

He clears his throat, and unfolds the piece of paper.

Finally he begins to read.

JOHN WARSOG
'Fuck you.'

John folds the piece of paper and puts it back into his
pocket. He takes off his glasses.

JOHN WARSOG
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If
there are any questions, you may
direct them to that brick wall over
there.

John walks back into the building. Kyle's mother is furious.

KYLE'S MOTHER
HEY, YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH
THIS!!!

John pauses to pull down his pants and moon the crowd, then
continues on into the building.

KYLE'S MOTHER
THAT DOES IT! NO MORE MR. NICE
PROTESTERS! It's time for PLAN B!

CARTMAN'S MOM
Oh Carol, where are the port-o-
potties?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Over there hon. What, you need to
drop some friends off at the pool?

CARTMAN'S MOM
Oh yes indeedy!

The two women laugh, in spite of themselves.

Cartman's mom runs to the toilet, slams the door, and shits
up a storm.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

Grandpa is sitting below a large tree.

STAN
Okay, grandpa, all you have to do is
sit there. We'll do the rest. You
got the cow all tied up?

Kyle finishes putting a rope around a scared cow's waist.

KYLE
Yep, all done.

STAN
Kay, come on, guys.

The boys all grab the rope, and start to hoist the cow up,
using a branch above grandpa's head as a pully.

CARTMAN
Why don't we just shoot him?

STAN
You dumbass, Cartman! It has to look
natural, or else we'll all get busted.

KYLE
Yeah, stupid.

The boys pull on the rope and the cow gets hoisted up over
grandpa.

GRANDPA
That's good, Billy... A little higher
now...

The cow dangles in the air. The boys wrap their end of the
rope around the base of another tree.

EXT. TOON CENTRAL - NIGHT

Kyle's mother walks up to the news cameras and the
microphones.

KYLE'S MOTHER
The network isn't taking us seriously.
In the past, people have had to die
for what they believed in, and we
are prepared to do the same. Ready?

The people near the sling shot all nod.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Mr. McKormick, you shall be a martyr
to us all. God speed.

KYLE'S MOTHER
WE WILL NOT LET THESE CORPORATE
HALFWITS RUIN OUR CHILDREN'S MINDS!!
LAUNCH!!!

The sling shot is cut, Mr. McKormick goes flying into the
air and hits SPLAT!! into the side of the Toon Central
building, dying instantly.

The news people all gasp.

KYLE'S MOTHER
We will all follow suit! One by one
if that's what it takes!!

The line to the port-o-potties is getting longer. People
moan with stomach aches.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

The cow dangles dangerously above grandpa. The other end of
the rope is tied around a tree.

Stan holds a knife in his hand, ready to cut the rope, and
send the cow on top of his grandfather.

STAN
Are you ready grandpa?

GRANDPA
Does the Pope crap in the woods?

Stan is about to cut the rope when suddenly, a light flashes!

The boys all look over at the road, where Officer Barbrady
has pulled up in his patrol car.

Barbrady studies the scene from his car, he looks at the
cow, the grandpa below it, Stan with the knife in his hand...

The boys' eyes all grow wide.

A long time passes.

BARBRADY
...Carry on.

Barbrady drives away. The boys all sigh.

STAN
Okay, here we go... Bye Grandpa, it
was nice knowing you.

GRANDPA
Cut the damn rope already!

But now another FLASH!! This one is HUGE. The boys all reel
back from its glow.

KYLE
Whoa, what is that?!

When the smoke clears, the boys see a tall figure, dressed
in black and carrying a sythe.

STAN
Whoa... It looks like... death!

GRANDPA
It's about time you late ass lazy
son of a whore!

Death looks down at Grandpa.

GRANDPA
Come on! Let's go!

But death walks past grandpa and heads towards the boys.

GRANDPA
What the --

STAN
Hey, he's coming towards US!

CARTMAN
Why is Death coming after us?

But death relentlessly heads for the boys. The boys all scream
and run.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

The boys run inside. Death is just behind them. It makes a
horrible sound.

DEATH
Mrrrrr...

The boys all run up into Stan's room and slam the door shut.
Death is just on the other side, pounding on the door.

THE BOYS
Help, run run run!

CARTMAN
What are we gonna do?!

Stan looks over at his telephone.

EXT. TOON CENTRAL - DAY

REPORTER
As the day progresses, more and more
South Park residents continue to
sling shot their bodies into the
side of the Toon Central building.

Behind him, an OLD LADY flies through the air and splats
into the building.

REPORTER
Toon Central is under incredible
pressure to cancel the show, and has
already lost over 20 percent of their
sponsors...

Kyle's mother walks up to Stan's mother and hands her a cell
phone.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Here, Carol, I think it's your boy.

STAN'S MOTHER
Oh, thanks.
(Into the phone)
What is it, Stanly hon? Did you break
something?

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

STAN
Mom, death is here and he's trying
to take all of us away with him.

The boys all look worriedly at the door which is still
pounding and shaking.

EXT. TOON CENTRAL

STAN'S MOTHER
Stanly honey, you need to leave Mommy
alone, I'm doing something very very
important for your little well-being
there.

STAN
Yeah, but mom --

STAN'S MOTHER
Here honey, talk to your father.

Stan's dad gets on the phone.

STAN'S FATHER
Did you turn the heat down?

STAN
Dad, death is coming --

STAN'S FATHER
Keep the thermostat under 70. Take
care of your grandfather.

Click.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE

Stan hangs up the phone. Death starts carving away at the
door with his sicle.

STAN
Dammit! You know, I think that if
parents would spend less time worrying
about what their kids watch on T.V.
and more time worrying about what's
going on in their kids' lives, this
world would be a much better place.

KYLE
Yes, I think that parents get only
get so offended by television because
they rely on it as a babysitter and
the sole educator of their kids.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmph mmm rmph
mph mph rmp mm.

KYLE
Totally dude.

STAN
Good point man.

Suddenly death BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR!!!

STAN
AAGH!!

KYLE
Quick! Jump out the window!!

Just before Death can reach them, the boys jump out the
window.

COMMERCIAL BREAK 2

ACT III

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

The boys run screaming down South Park avenue. Death pursues
them on a tricycle.

Grandpa is pursuing Death in his wheelchair.

GRANDPA
Come back here you pompass son of a
panzy!

Slowly, Death catches up to the boys, he stretches out his
bony hand...

STAN
AAGH!!

KYLE
Don't let him touch you! You die if
he touches you!!

GRANDPA
I'm over here you son of a whore!

Death chases the boys past a TV shop, where dozens of TVs
are on in the window.

They are all playing Terrance and Phillip.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

Terrance and Phillip are floating through space with little
space suits on.

PHILLIP
Oh Terrance... What color is the
wind?

Death looks intrigued.

TERRANCE
I don't know why don't you check --

Terrance turns his ass towards Phillip and farts.

PHILLIP
OH! YOU FARTED!!

Death laughs loudly. He has to lay down his scythe to hold
his stomach.

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, you know what my space
suit smells like?

PHILLIP
No, Terrance, why don't you tell me.

TERRANCE
Well, it smells like... A dirty fart!

They laugh. Death laughs even harder.

STAN
Hey look!

The boys stop running and notice that death is watching the
show.

Everybody gathers around the TV and watches. Laughing happily
together.

EXT. TOON CENTRAL

The reporter is standing out front of the Toon Central
building.

REPORTER
Hours have passed and still the die
hard South Park parents are killing
themselves in front of the Toon
Central building one by one.

Another person splats into the side of the building.

REPORTER (CONT'D)
Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems
to be going around is... Wait, wait...
I'm getting word that John Warsog,
the president of the network is going
to make a statement!

Warsog again takes the stand, just as another MAN is about
to be released from the sling shot. A look of relief crosses
the man's face.

JOHN WARSOG
Ladies and Gentlemen, your Nazi-esque
tactics of trying to stink us out
with your rancid feces... has worked.

The people look confused. The port-o-potties are indeed backed
up.

JOHN WARSOG
Therefore, today we will officially
be taking 'Terrance and Phillip' off
the network, and replacing it with
reruns of 'She's The Sheriff.'
Starring Suzanne Summers.

The people all rejoice and cheer.

JOHN WARSOG
Now get away from here and take your
diarrhea with you!

The townspeople all cheer and rejoice. The two guys at the
sling shot accidentally let it go, and the man goes flying
into the air and splats against the building.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Now at last we can return to
normality!

EXT. SOUTH PARK TV SHOP - NIGHT

The boys and death are still happily watching Terrance and
Phillip.

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip.

PHILLIP
Yes Terrance.

TERRANCE
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?

PHILLIP
I don't know Terrance, let me check...

CARTMAN
Oh, oh. Don't look there Phillip,
you're going to get farted on!!

Phillip moves his head towards Terrance's ass when suddenly
FWOOP! A second of static and then the Toon Central logo.

The boys and death look confused.

NARRATOR
We interrupt this program to bring
you some loud static.

Loud static fills the screen.

Death goes absolutely ballistic. It lets out a horrible cry.

DEATH
MARRRR!!!!!

And turns back on the boys.

KYLE
AAGH!!

Death stretches out its skeleton hand and touches Kenny.

Kenny immediately falls to the ground.

KYLE
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!!

The boys stop and look at Kenny's motionless body.

KYLE
(To Death)
You bastard!!

STAN
Wow, I guess Death was just coming
after Kenny the whole time.

Grandpa wheels himself up, panting.

GRANDPA
HEY! You were supposed to kill ME!!

Death shakes its head.

GRANDPA
That's not fair, God Dammit! My
grandpa asked me to kill him and I
did it!

Death says nothing, but points his boney finger to a glowing
fog.

STAN
Whoa...

In the glowing fog, another EXTREMELY OLDER man appears,
floating above the ground.

OLD OLD MAN
Billy...

GRANDPA
Grandpa?

OLD OLD MAN
That's right, Billy.

GRANDPA
My name's not Billy, Grandpa! And
what's wrong with you? Why do you
look all haggard?

OLD OLD MAN
I asked you to kill me, Billy, but I
was wrong... And now I am forced to
spend eternity in limbo.

GRANDPA
Limbo?

OLD OLD MAN
I was wrong to put you in that
position, Billy. Just like you're
wrong to put little Billy in it now.
You're so obsessed with ending your
life, you're not thinking about what
you're doing to his.

Grandpa thinks.

OLD OLD MAN
You must wait to die of natural
causes.

GRANDPA
But I've been waiting for twenty-
five years! Let nature run its course,
or else end up in limbo...

The old old man starts to fade away. He, death and Kenny all
float up to the sky.

OLD OLD MAN
Natural causes, Billy... Natural
causes...

STAN
C'mon you guys, let's go home.

Rats come and pull Kenny away.

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Stan's mom and dad walk in the door. Kyle's mom is with them.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Here they are!

STAN'S DAD
Well, we did it son! We have fought
a battle for your well-being and
won!

STAN
What do you mean?

STAN'S MOM
We got Terrance and Phillip taken
off the air!

The boys all look terribly disappointed.

CARTMAN
(To Kyle)
You son of a bitch! Your mom sucks!

KYLE'S MOTHER
But look what they put on!

Kyle's mother flips on the television.

TELEVISION
And now back to 'She's the Sheriff!'!

The boys look horribly disappointed.

CARTMAN
NOOOOO!!!! GOD NOOOOOO!!!!!

ANGLE - TELEVISION

SUZANNE SUMMERS
You were the one behind all these
shenanigans!

MALE ACTOR
Yeah, well, you're the stupid ho
that started it.

KYLE'S MOTHER
What did he say?

SUZANNE SUMMERS
Up yours, buttmunch!

RESUME - LIVING ROOM

The parents are all staring at the T.V. Kyle's mom is furious.

KYLE'S MOTHER
WHAT-WHAT-WHAAAT?!?!

Kyle's mother picks her sign back up.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Come on everybody! Back to New York!!

The parents all dash out the door.

KYLE
Hey Stan, now that Terrance and
Phillip has been taken off the air,
what are we going to do for
entertainment?

STAN
I dunno... We could start breathing
gas fumes...

CARTMAN
My uncle says that smoking crack is
kinda cool...

KYLE
Hey! Why don't we go watch some of
those porno movie thingies?

STAN
Cool!

CARTMAN
Yeah!

Grandpa wheels out wearing tourist garb and holding pamphlets.

STAN
What are you doing grandpa?

GRANDPA
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did
you know over 400 people are eaten
naturally by lions in Africa every
year?

STAN
That's my silly grandpa!

The boys all laugh and fart.

"THE JEFFERSONS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[The neighborhood. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny ride down the
street on their Big Wheels.]

STAN
Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought
the Donovans' old house.

KYLE
Yeah, I think they already moved in.
I saw moving vans in their driveway
two days ago.

CARTMAN
I hope they're not Austrians. That's
the last thing this town needs.

KYLE
Hey look!

KID
Hello.

KYLE
Hey. Do you live here?

KID
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad.
Are you gonna be my new friends?

CARTMAN
No.

KID
I really like your town. My dad wanted
to move somewhere to get away from it
all. He said he wanted piece and quiet,
and to live with a bunch of hicks who
don't know anything.

STAN
What's that you're wearing?

KID
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best
for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.


CARTMAN
Your name is Blanket. Right. Well, Blanket,
I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends
Timsy , Winky  and Nod.  Unfortunately,
we have to be off to the Land of Booger
Trees, so we'll be leaving now.

BLANKET
Wait, don't you guys wanna come inside
and play?

CARTMAN
Huh look dude, we're in the fourth
grade, okay? You know what that means?
It means we don't hang out with a little
kid. Come on, guys, let's get back to
our Big Wheels.

BLANKET
We have arcade games inside.

[The old Donovan house, now Blanket's home.]

BLANKET
Dad?

STAN
Whoa. Dude, no way.

CARTMAN
Oh my God, this is awesome!

STAN
Dude, are these all your toys?

BLANKET
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves
toys and video games.

KYLE
Dude, he must be loaded! What does he
do?

BLANKET
He's retired now.

CARTMAN
Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the
coolest dad in the world!

BLANKET
Come on, my dad's probably out in the
back yard.

[The back yard. The sliding door opens up to a small park, a
Neverland, with a giraffe, small Ferris wheel, small carousel,
and other things. The boys step through the doorway]

CARTMAN
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house
like this?!

BLANKET
Dad, you out here??

DAD
Here I am, Blanket!  Heeee!  Jeh chabee
durtah!  Blanket!! Oh my beautiful blanket!


KYLE
What's wrong with his face?

STAN
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's
a burn victim or something.

BLANKET
Guys, this is my dad, Michael Ja-

MR. JEFFERSON
Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh.
Hey, you wanna play with me?  Come on,
let's climb the tree!  Come on, climb
the tree, climb the tree!

Have you been up my ...Wishing Tree? Tuh!

It's where I come to think and dream.

And now I'd like to show you my ...Wishing Tree. Jam on!

Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. Hee hee!

Imagination is the key.

KYLE
Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.


MR. JEFFERSON
Won't you imagine along with me?

KYLE
Mr. Jefferson?

MR. JEFFERSON
We can be spacemen, or pirates on the
sea Chuckajam on

Yes we can do everything, and I mean, everything! Chuckajam on


Up in my Wishing Tree! Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!


[Stark's Pond, day. A group of kids skate around lazily on its
frozen surface. Stan and friends race over a rise towards the
lake]

STAN
Hey you guys! You guys!  You gotta come
with us over to the Jeffersons!

RED
The Jeffersons?

CARTMAN
They're a new family that just moved
to South Park! We met this kid named
Blanket, and he has the coolest dad
in the world!

KYLE
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all
the kids in town to go play over at
their house.

CARTMAN
They have like, video games and rides
and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and,
and in their back yard, guess what they
have in their back yard?? Guess. A train.


CRAIG
No way.

CARTMAN
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe
in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just
not come!

CRAIG
I believe in Mr. Jefferson.

[The Jefferson house, arcade room. As the kids enjoy the toys
and games found there, Jefferson swings above them on a spacious
swing with Bebe on his lap]

JEFFERSON
Weeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're
swinging!

BLANKET
Who wants the first cotton candy?


KIDS
Memememememememememe...

MR. JEFFERSON
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!  Ooooh,
let's go ride the choo-choo train!


CARTMAN
Choo-choo train! Yay!

[The Jefferson back yard. The kids follow Jefferson to the train]


MR. JEFFERSON
Let's ride the train! The train!

Would you like to ride the train with me,

and start a magical journey?

CARTMAN
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're
so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.

MR. JEFFERSON
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.


CARTMAN
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.


[duet]

MR. JEFFERSON
Let's ride and ride on the train together


CARTMAN
... Train together


MR. JEFFERSON
On a journey through both of our minds.


CARTMAN
... I've got time. Do youuu??

[back near the sliding door, Stan, Kyle and Kenny look on. Blanket
stands next to them and Kyle notices Blanket's left leg]

KYLE
Dude, what happened to your knee?

BLANKET
I fell down.

KYLE
Mr. Jefferson!

MR. JEFFERSON
Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.


CARTMAN
Choo-choo train.

KYLE
Mr.! Goddamnit. Here, come on. We need
to clean that up.

[The bathroom, nicely appointed. Kyle sits Blanket on the toilet
and dresses the wound]

KYLE
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.


BLANKET
Ow!

KYLE
I know, I know. Be cool.

BLANKET
Thank you. That already feels better.


KYLE
So, dude, do you have any brothers
or sisters?

BLANKET
I have a half-brother and a half-sister.
But they live with their mom now.


KYLE
And where is your mom?

BLANKET
I don't have a mom.

KYLE
You must have a mom.  You mean she doesn't
live here, or she's dead, or what?


BLANKET
No. I was made in a laboratory.

KYLE
What?

BLANKET
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he
put me in a test tube. Then, they put
me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was
born, Daddy took me home.

KYLE
So you never met your mom?

BLANKET
Noo... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards
and nannies, if that counts.

KYLE
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.

[The neighborhood, some time later. The boys are walking home]


CARTMAN
Oh man, that was great! You guys know
what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm
his best friend, and I can go over to
his house whenever I want! I'm supposed
to go right back over there after dinner
tonight!

KYLE
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that
kid.

CARTMAN
You feel bad for him?! He has everything
a kid could want!

KYLE
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants
to be a kid, not have one.

CARTMAN
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect
sense! A guy moves into South Park with
a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and
KYLE has to see a problem with it!
Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's
happened to this town in a long time,
and if you miss this up, so help me
GOD, I will rip your balls off with
my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn
you!

[Stan's house, afternoon. Stan enters the kitchen through the
back door. Randy is at the breakfast nook reading a paper, Sharon
puts a coffee pot onto the counter]

RANDY
Well, there he is. Where have you been
all afternoon.

STAN
I was over at the new neighbors, the
Jeffersons.

SHARON
Oh, are they nice people?

STAN
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.


SHARON
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis
and the Stotches over for dinner tonight.
Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.


[Stan's house, evening. The Marshes and their guests are seated
at table for dinner. On screen left are seated Sheila, Chris
and Linda. On screen right are seated Gerald, Mr. Jefferson,
and Sharon, and Randy is at the head of the table]

KYLE'S FATHER
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say
you moved here from Kentucky?

MR. JEFFERSON
Kentucky, yeh.

RANDY
I heard people saying you all were from
Illinois.

MR. JEFFERSON
No, theh, they're ignorant. That's ignorant.


CHRIS
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?


MR. JEFFERSON
Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in...
pharmaceuticals

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well our boys have really taken a liking
to you. You seem to really have a way
with them.

MR. JEFFERSON
I just id- identify so much with children.
Their innocence, their beauty. I think
that God is in the face of every child.


RANDY
....Yeeeah.

SHARON
...They are fun.  Boys, you okay out
there?

[The living room. Stan, Kyle, and Blanket are seated on the sofa,
eating]

STAN
Fine Mom.

BLANKET
Wow, these are great. What are they
called again?

KYLE
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna
take that veil off so you can eat?


BLANKET
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I
have to keep my face hidden.

CARTMAN
What the hell is going on?! Are you
having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!


STAN
No, my parents are.

CARTMAN
You guys better not be trying to Bogart
my friend away!

STAN
What?

CARTMAN
He is MY friend, got it?! I was friends
with him before you assholes were,
and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm serisouslih!
You'd better not be talking bad about
me in there to Mr. Jefferson!

[The dining table]

KYLE'S FATHER
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in
Eagle today.

RANDY
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson?
Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?


MR. JEFFERSON
D'huh?

CHRIS
I think he's definitely going to jail.
I just love seeing smug celebrities
get their comeuppance.

MR. JEFFERSON
I think it's wrong what the police do
to wealthy black men.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not
one of those who think that the police
go around framing rich black people
just because they're jealous..

MR. JEFFERSON
Yeah! Because their hearts are full
of greed and they have... doodoo in
their soul.

[Park County Police Station. Inside an officer waits for a fax
to finish printing. As another officer walks by with a cup of
coffee, he takes a sheet from the machine]

OFFICER
Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.


SERGEANT
Whatcha got?

OFFICER
Looks like a new family has just moved
into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson,
age 50, bought a house there and paid
cash. He seems to have a lot of money.


SERGEANT
So, what's the problem?

OFFICER
Take a look. Says here...  He's black.


SERGEANT
By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time
to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just
like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!
We've got another rich black guy. I
want him humiliated and dragged through
the dirt, and I want it done by the
books!

[Stan's house, night. Stan is asleep in his room when someone
pounds at his window. Stan wakes up, then goes to the window]


STAN
Kyle?

MR. JEFFERSON
Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'?

STAN
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the
morning!

MR. JEFFERSON
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.  T-shamon!
I'm a little boy forever.  Hey!

STAN
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school
tomorrow!

CARTMAN
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What
the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll
tell you what you're doing! You're trying
to steal MY best friend!

STAN
He just showed up here.

CARTMAN
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we
were best friends.

STAN
Jesus Christ!

KYLE
Dude, look who I found prowling around
in my back yard.

BLANKET
Hi Stan.

KYLE
He was out all alone in the middle of
the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even
home.

STAN
I know. He's here.

KYLE
What??

MR. JEFFERSON
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber
party!

STAN
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take
your son home.

MR. JEFFERSON
We can't go home. There's a ghost in
our house. Me and Blanket are scared.


BLANKET
Dad says it wants to eat us.

MR. JEFFERSON
Please don't make us go back home. Please!
We're scared, we're scared!

BLANKET
We're scared!

MR. JEFFERSON
Hee hee!

STAN
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but
we're going to sleep now!

KYLE
Come on, Blanket.

MR. JEFFERSON
Now let's all sleep and dream Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things shamon!
It's time for us all to say goodnight


CARTMAN
Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could
be around you all the time. You're awesome.


MR. JEFFERSON
I think you're awesome too, Cartman.


CARTMAN
Yeah?

MR. JEFFERSON
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Yeah?

MR. JEFFERSON
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Yeah?

STAN
Haaa!

MR. JEFFERSON
What's the matter, Stan? Did you have
a bad dream?

STAN
Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!


[The Jefferson house. An unmarked police car, blue in color,
waits across the street. The sergeant's partner sips on a soda]


SERGEANT
Murphy, you inside?

MURPHY
We're inside, sir. Harris was right.
This guy looks like he has more money
than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!
I'm planting the cocaine now.

SERGEANT
Johnson, what about you?

JOHNSON
Placing the blood spatter now, sir.


SERGEANT
Frakes?

FRAKES
Placing pubic hair from the raped girl
now, sir.

SERGEANT
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows
up, arrest him fast and try not to beat
him. There could be neighbors with video
cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?


HARRIS
Sir?

SERGEANT
Why is it that us policement around
the country have such a passion for
framing wealthy African-Americans with
crimes they didn't commit?

HARRIS
Oh why? I guess I never thought about
why, sir. We just do it.

SERGEANT
Twenty-five years I've been on the force.
I've seen every kind of sick, depraved
act known to humanity and still, when
I see a black man walk by who has more
money than me, I... want to vomit my
gizzards right in the gutter. But why?
Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's
just a big blue ball out there that's
mostly covered with water and we're
just goin' along for the ride.

[Stan's house, morning. Someone knocks on Stan's door.]

RANDY
Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan?
What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!

MR. JEFFERSON
Oh oh, we were just having a slumber
party.

RANDY
Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!


MR. JEFFERSON
Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant.
They're my friends. You see, I I didn't
have a childhood, so I'm really just
a child myself.  Here, everything's
okay. I want you each to have a hundred
dollars.

RANDY
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport
coat I've been wanting.

MR. JEFFERSON
Come on, Blanket. We have to go home
and feed the animals. Bye, friends.


SHARON
Boys, I do not want you going over to
Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?


STAN
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom.
That guy's a freak!

CARTMAN
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well,
excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you
can suck my fat hairy balls!

[The stakeout at Jefferson house, day. The two officers are snoring,
but the sergeant is roused by the sound of a voice]

MR. JEFFERSON
Come on, Blanket!

SERGEANT
Hey Harris Harris Harris! Harris!

HARRIS
What what what?

SERGEANT
It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right,
people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome
home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy
isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't
black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yeats!
Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect
is not black!  You son of a bitch, you
told my this guy was African-American!


HARRIS
It says right here on the final sheet
he is!

YEATS
Does that look like a black guy to
you?!

HARRIS
It said on the final sheet!

YEATS
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could
have made an innocent man go to jail
who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh!
Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are
we becoming? We're supposed to... protect
the people. Where have we lost our way?


HARRIS
Sir, it's possible that he is black,
even though he doesn't look it.

YEATS
To hell with you!! I'm never gonna
frame an innocent man again! Unless
I KNOW he's black for sure!!

[Inside the house, Mr. Jefferson closes all the windows and curtains]


MR. JEFFERSON
All the adults are trying to get us.
Get up to your room, Blanket, and put
your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!


KYLE
That poor kid.

STAN
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to
go over there.

BLANKET
Hi guys!

KYLE
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over
to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna
come with?

BLANKET
Really? You mean it?

MR. JEFFERSON
Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside
and play, guys!

STAN
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were
seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood
with us.

MR. JEFFERSON
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's
poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!


STAN
Mr. Jefferson, ih it might be good for
Blanket to learn how to chop wood


MR. JEFFERSON
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket?
Wee, look! He can fly!

KYLE
Jesus Christ, dude!

BLANKET
Aaaaaah!!

STAN
Stop, you fucking lunatic!!

KYLE
Dude, we have got to get that kid away
from him!

[Blanket's room. He's crying on a giant plush teddy bear. Mr.
Jefferson tries to soothe him]

MR. JEFFERSON
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's
okay, Blanket. Here, look.  Jeekabee
durtah!  Ow!  There, Blanket, shhhh.
Hey, hey look, hey look.  I got your
nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose.
I got your nose, Blanket. See?

BLANKET
Aaaaaaaa!

MR. JEFFERSON
No, Blanket, stop!  It's ignorant. You're
being ignorant!

[The Sergeant's house, later. He enters. A woman appears moments
later.]

WOMAN
Harrison, why haven't you called? You
know how I worry.

YEATS
I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting
the force.

MAGGIE
Quitting the force? You?

YEATS
None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't
even know if what we're doing is right.
The last thirteen hours we've been working
on a case, trying to get a real scumbag
off the streets. And when he walked
up to the door, I could have sworn he
was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference
anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because
it seems like every time we frame a
rich black guy, he's back out on the
streets in no time. It's just like OJ.
Do you know how hard those cops worked
to frame him? The tireless hours they
put in?? And then he just gets off because
somebody messed up and said the N word
out loud too many times. I guess I'm
just tired. I'm jast damn tired.

MAGGIE
Not another word of that kind of talk,
Harrison Yeats.  Believe me I would
love nothin' more than to have you quit
the force and no longer have to worry
about whether or not you're comin' home.
But I know you. Framin' rich black men
for crimes they didn't commit is in
your blood. Wipin' that rich, smug smile
off their faces is the only thing that
puts a smile on yours. You're a good
cop, Harrsion Yeats. You don't have
to question that. Because I'm here to
tell you.

YEATS
And you're a good wife, Maggie. You
know me better than I know myself.


MAGGIE
Where're you goin'?

YEATS
Think I've got a little more work to
do.

[The Jefferson house, night. Cartman walks up to the door and
knocks]

CARTMAN
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend
in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman.
Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over
tonight, remember?

[Mr. Jefferson room. He's on the phone with someone.]

MR. JEFFERSON
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you
have to fly out here right now! My nose
came off again!  I know you live in
California; I'll pay for your plane
ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need
some more of that cream and the injections!
I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm
melting!

[The Jefferson house, outside. A ladder is propped up against
the side of the house. Kyle, Stan, and another boy approach.
The boy wears the same mask Blanket usually does.]

KYLE
All right. Thanks a lot for helping
us, dude.

KENNY
Yeah, sure, whatever.

STAN
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket
until we can get the real Blanket somewhere
safe.

KENNY
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?

KYLE
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough
attention to his son to notice. Come
on!

[Blanket's bedroom. Blanket silently cries and the door creaks
open]

STAN
Blanket, you in here?

BLANKET
Hi guys!

KYLE
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away
for a little while, okay?

BLANKET
You are? Oh thank you thank you thank
you!

STAN
All right dude, get in his bed.

KENNY
All right, but you guys owe me for
this.

STAN
Dude, whatever. At least you finally
get to do something.

[Santa Barbara Police Department, Snetzl's desk. His phone rings
and he picks up]

SNETZL
Santa Barbara Police Department, this
is Snetzl.

[Park County Police Department, Yeats' desk.]

YEATS
Hello, this is Sergeant Yeats over at
the Park County Police Department in
Colorado.

SNETZL
Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?


YEATS
Well, we've been trying to frame this
guy who just moved into our town, and
the fil-o-fax says he moved from yoru
area. One Martin Jefferson?

SNETZL
Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans
named Jefferson here. If we had, we
would have framed him ourselves.

YEATS
Well, he doesn't really look that black.


SNETZL
Yeah, I don't uh... Hold on a second.
There was oine we framed a couple of
times, but the black bastard was so
rich he made bail and disappeared before
the trial.

YEATS
You say he disappeared? What did you
frame him for?

SNETZL
We uhhh found some kids that had stayed
over at his place, and we asked them
to lie and make up some false molestation
charges.

YEATS
Molestation, nice.

SNETZL
Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years,
but we were finally able to arrest him.
Then we planted some evidence, took
embarassing photos of his penis, and
threw him in a dirty prison cell with
doodie feces on the walls. You should
have seen him squirm!

YEATS
That's damn fine police work, sergeant.
Damn fine.

SNETZL
Heh yeah, but the point is this guy
didn't really look black either. We
had to sneak in while he was asleep
and get a DNA sample to be sure.

YEATS
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be
the same guy!

[The Jefferson house. Cartman knocks on the front door again]


CARTMAN
Mr. Jefferson, hello??

[The bathroom. Stan, Kyle, and Blanket prepare a carry-on bag.]


KYLE
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before
your dad sees us.

MR. JEFFERSON
What are you doing with my Blanket?
Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee
durtah! Hee!

STAN, KYLE, BLANKET
HAAAAA!

STAN
Go go RUUN!

MR. JEFFERSON
Sutah!

[The Hallway. The boys run towards the stairs]

STAN, KYLE, BLANKET
HAAAAA!

MR. JEFFERSON
Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!

STAN
Oh Jesus!

KENNY
What the hell is going on, you guys?


MR. JEFFERSON
My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket!


KENNY
Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!

MR. JEFFERSON
Wee, he can fly! He can fly!

KENNY
Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-

STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastard!

MR. JEFFERSON
Blanket? Blanket! Come play!

BLANKET
Nooo!

KYLE
Come on!

[The Jefferson house, front lawn. Kyle opens the front door and
the boys exit]

STAN
Run Blanket Run!

BLANKET
Ah!

MR. JEFFERSON
Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!

KYLE
Hang on, Blanket!

MR. JEFFERSON
Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!

YEATS
Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You
are wanted for child mo-les-tation!


CARTMAN
No! I am sick and tired of people harassing
Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing
since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick
lies! That he molests children, that
he's a bad father, that he has plastic
surgery!

MR. JEFFERSON
It's ignorant.

CARTMAN
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little
different. But that's because he had
to work all the time when he was young
and missed out on his childhood. What's
wrong with wanting to have the innocence
and beauty of a child.

KYLE
All right, let's just say all the bad
things said about Mr. Jefferson are
lies! Let's say the police department
does just go around spending their time
framing people for crimes they didn't
commit!  Let's say it's all made up,
and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy
who's trying to be a child because he
never got to have a childhood. Well
that's fine, except for that he HAS
children now! And when people have children,
they have to grow up!

MR. JEFFERSON
You're right. I've been so obsessed
with my childhood that I've forgotten
about his. I thought having lots of
rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket
doesn't need a playmate. He needs a
father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo
gainuh.  Blanket, I wanna give away
all my money. I I wanna get a normal
job and... take a shot at raising you
in a normal setting.

BLANKET
Look everybody! I'm a normal little
boy.

YEATS
Well, if you're gonna give away all
your money, then, I guess we can drop
all those charges. No point in putting
another poor black man in jail.

KYLE
All right! Things just might work out!


MR. JEFFERSON
Things can always work out, as long
as we know we have the power to change.


We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts


And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays

And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,


And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.

Jejabee durtah!

Pam Brady, Trey Parker & Matt Stone



[South Park Elementary. The class bell rings and the children
are rowdy.]

MR. GARRISON
Settle down, children. I have some
difficult news. This is going to make
you all very sad.  The school board
is considering firing me as your teacher.
There's a possibility that I will be
let go and never allowed to teach you
again.  Yes, Stanley?

STAN
That's okay with us.

KYLE
Yeah.

KID
Yeah, we don't care.

CARTMAN
Yeah, that's fine.

MR. GARRISON
No it isn't it makes you very sad. Now,
apparently, the school board thinks
that I don't teach you anything about
current events, so tomorrow they're
going to have you do presentations for
the whole board.

CLASS
Aawwww!

MR. GARRISON
"Current Events in South Park." Now,
I want you all to read a newspaper,
or better yet, watch television, and
come up with something current in South
Park to do a report on.

CLASS
Aawwww!

MR. GARRISON
Now, this'll be a group project, so
I'm going to place you all into groups
of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe,
Clyde, Pip, and Token , you'll be Group
1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric,
Kenny, aaand, and Tweek.

TWEEK
AAAghah heheh.

STAN
Oh, not Tweek.

KYLE
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.


MR. GARRISON
There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I
bet he'll do a great job in your group.


TWEEK
I can't take that kind of pressure.
No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!

STAN
Dude, we can't work with this kid.


TWEEK
Yuh-ugh!

MR. GARRISON
That's what Chad Everett thought when
the new female intern joined the cast
of Medical Center. He thought. "Who
is this woman with her gazungas and
high heels? What does she know about
medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved
Chad Everett's brother with a kidney
transplant. So, you see?

STAN
No.

MR. GARRISON
Well, let me put it another way. You
have to give your oral report to the
entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow!
And if it doesn't kick ass, and you
make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack
you bitches up!

TWEEK
Waah!

[SOUTH PARK, DOWNTOWN. OFF TO THE RIGHT OF TOM'S RHINOPLASTY IS A COFFEE STORE
Tweek Bros. A businessman walks in with
briefcase.]

MR. TWEEK
Hello there, customer.

CUSTOMER
Hello. How are you today?

MR. TWEEK
Great. What can I get for you? Large
coffee, small coffee?

CUSTOMER
I'm actually interested in something
else. I'm John Postem from the Harbucks
Coffee Corporation

MR. TWEEK
Oh, you're that corporate guy who's
been calling.

POSTEM
That's right. How come yuu don't call
me back? All we wanna do is buy out
your coffee shop here.

MR. TWEEK
Oh, forget it, my my store is not for
sale.

POSTEM
My company's prepared to make you a
veerry generous offer.  This is a Cramsonite
briefcase. All leather, it has four
compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?


MR. TWEEK
Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop
is worth a lot to me.

POSTEM
Well all right.  How about $500,000?


MR. TWEEK
The answer is still no, Mr. Postem.
You see, when my father opened this
store 30 yars ago, he cared about only
one thing: making a great cup of coffee.
Sure, we may take a little longer to
brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy
names, but I guess we just care a little
more.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is
still home-brewed from the finest beans
we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is
a simpler cup, for a simpler America.


POSTEM
Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna
have to open our Harbucks right next
door to you.

MR. TWEEK
But that could put me out of business.


POSTEM
Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal!
Get used to it!

BARBRADY
Hello, Mr. Tweek.

MR. TWEEK
Hi, Officer Barbrady.

BARBRADY
Who was that?

MR. TWEEK
Oh, just some dong. What can I get for
you.

BARBRADY
Ths usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.


MR. TWEEK
Bye-bye.

[South Park Elementary. The class is now in groups of five. Tweek
is still wired]

STAN
Okay, we have to do this stupid report,
sooo-

TWEEK
AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn.
Aaarrrhaharn.

STAN
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it
about.

CARTMAN
How about we do it on that Raymond guy
on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.


KYLE
No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond
again! It has to be on a current event
in South Park. Tweek, do you have any
ideas?

TWEEK
Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!

STAN
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.


TWEEK
The gnomes!

STAN
What?

TWEEK
We can do our report on the gnomes.


STAN
What gnomes?

TWEEK
The underpants gnomes. The little guys
that, that come into your room late,
late at night and steal your underpants.


CARTMAN
Oh, so that's where all my underpants
go.

KYLE
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've
ever heard.

STAN
Yeah, I've neve seen any underpants
gnomes.

TWEEK
They come out at 3:30 in the morning.
Most people aren't up then, but I am.
I can't sleep. Ever.

KYLE
Dude, we can't do a presentation on
underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will
fail us because you're making it up.


TWEEK
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll
prove it to you.

[The Tweek house that night. Mr. Tweek and his wife are in the
kitchen. They have three coffeemakers going on at once. Coffee
mugs are everywhere]

MR. TWEEK
They want me to sell the store, and
it's so much money.

MRS. TWEEK
Some things are more important than
money.  The people of South Park count
on you to give them that first cup of
coffee every day.

MR. TWEEK
I know, but if they open a Harbucks
right next door, we might go out of
business. They really have my balls
in a vice grip.

MRS. TWEEK
Oh, hello, son. How was your day?

TWEEK
UUuuUunh!

MRS. TWEEK
That's good. Who are your little friends?


TWEEK
What do you mean?!

KYLE
We're his oral report buddies.

STAN
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to
write it.

MRS. TWEEK
Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew
up another pot for later.

KYLE
Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.


MRS. TWEEK
Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh


MR. TWEEK
Country fresh, like the morning after
a rainstorm.

STAN
'K. Maybe it'll help us figure out what
to do our report on. We have to present
it to the entire South Park town committee
tomorrow.

MR. TWEEK
Oh. I've got one for you. How about
doing a report on how large corporations
take over little family-owned businesses.


MRS. TWEEK
Richard!

MR. TWEEK
No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should
learn how the corporate machine is ruining
America. You see, I own a coffee shop
and now a great, big, multi-million
dollar company is going to move in and
try to take all my business, which means
I may have to shut down and sell my
son Tweek into slavery.

TWEEK
Mwaaah! Slavery?

MR. TWEEK
Yes, slavery.

STAN
Wow, that sucks, dude.

MR. TWEEK
They really have my balls in a salad
shooter.

KYLE
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's
underpants gnomes.

STAN
Yeah.

MRS. TWEEK
Now, Tweek, how many times do we have
to tell you? Your underpants are missing
because you lose them, not because of
underpants gnomes.

TWEEK
Uunnnnhh!

KYLE
Come on, you guys! We better get to
work!

MR. TWEEK
Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is
a much more fertile subject.

MRS. TWEEK
Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you
have to preach to some eight-year olds.


MR. TWEEK
Actually, honey, I think those little
tykes are just what we need. I've got
an idea.

[later that night, in Tweek's room. The boys sip their coffee.]


KYLE
Man, this stuff is strong.

STAN
Kind of bitter.

TWEEK
What if my parents go out of business?
Uhwhat'll I do?

KYLE
Don't worry about it.

TWEEK
But we'll starve and die like dogs.


CARTMAN
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare.
Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly
happy being poor and on welfare. Right,
Kenny?

KENNY
(Fuck you!)

CARTMAN
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.

KYLE
Well, let's just try to finish all this
coffee, so we can stay up.

[STILL LATER
10:08 p.m..]

TWEEK
Aaaaaa!

Kyle	Woohoo! [dives from the bed into a pile of toys, then runs
back to the bed]

KENNY
(Let me try! Let me try!)

STAN
Yeess, this stuff rocks!

KYLE
Honest, dudes! I feel awesome!

STAN
Whoopee!

KENNY
(Look at me! Look at me!)

CARTMAN
Eyah! Eyah! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer!
You guys! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.


KYLE
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this
stuff?

TWEEK
I just have ground.

KYLE
Killer!!

CARTMAN
Ey, let me have some grounds.

KYLE
Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!

[10
15 p.m. gives way to 3:26 a.m., which
finds the boys sitting against the bed.
Tweek is on it, and Cartman is passed
out next to the toys, surrounded by
pools of vomit. Kenny looks sleepy]


KYLE
Hogh, my stomach hurts.

STAN
Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.

KYLE
Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned
underpants gnomes, Tweek!

TWEEK
Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in
my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh
no I'm going insane!

STAN
Well, this is just great! We haven't
gotten anything done, and we're totally
screwed!

MR. TWEEK
How's the report going, boys?

STAN
Bad!

MR. TWEEK
Oh, do you need some more coffee?

THE BOYS
Eugh.

CARTMAN
No... more... coffee. Blech.

MR. TWEEK
Well. Boys, ub. I don't mean to pry,
but, if you want it, I wrote your report
for you.

ALL
You did?!

MR. TWEEK
Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers.
Of course, you don't have to use it...


STAN
No, we'll use it.

MR. TWEEK
All right.  And it can be our little
secret about who wrote it, right?


KYLE
Sure.

MR. TWEEK
Now, when you give the report,  just
make sure that you read this part first,
okay?


[the gnomes open the door and enter]

"Search for underpants, hey

We won't stop until we have underpants

Yum tum yummy tum day!"

TWEEK
There they are!


[A gnome goes for Tweek's bottom drawer, opens it, and takes
out some underpants.]

"Time to go to work, work all night

Search for underpants, hey!

We won't stop until we have underpants

Yum tum yummy tum day!"


And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear
it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll
like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade
for it.

TWEEK
You guys, look! Look! You're missing
it!

[THE GNOMES TAKE OFF WITH TWO PAIRS OF UNDERPANTS
]

"We won't stop until we have underpants

Yum tum yummy tum day! "

TWEEK
Aaaaa! They took them again!

KYLE
Thanks, dude.

MR. TWEEK
My pleasure. G'night, boys.

STAN
Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!

TWEEK
Why do they torture me like this?! Why
can't they leave me alone?!

KYLE
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with
you, Tweek?!

TWEEK
They took my underpants again! Soon
they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!


[South Park Elementary, the next day. The five-member South Park
committee listens as Tweek's group speaks]

KYLE
And as the voluminous corporate automaton
bulldozes its way through bantam America,


CARTMAN
What will become of the endeavoring
American family?

MR. GARRISON
I don't think they wrote this, Mr.
Hat.

STAN
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate
machine.

TWEEK
Uurrgh!

KYLE
And that's our report, I guess.

MR. GARRISON
Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't
even-!

LADY MEMBER
Great job!

MR. GARRISON
Yes, great job.

LADY MEMBER
Boys, you have really opened our eyes.
We didn't even know this was happening.


CARTMAN
Neither did we.

LADY MEMBER
Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we
were wrong about you. You really are
teaching these kids something.

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like
a dickhole, but I told you so.

LADY MEMBER
Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow
these boys's cause. Let's join them
in the fight against corporate takeovers!
Lead the way, boys!

STAN
Huh??

TWEEK
Uunh, it's too much pressure!

[Harbucks is going up]

POSTEM
Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign
is really bright and flashy now.

MRS. TWEEK
My goodness. That's going to be a huge
coffee house, honey.

MR. TWEEK
Yes, it is.  They really have my balls
in a juice maker.  Oh, hello, son, uh.
How did your report go?

TWEEK
Waahh!

KYLE
I think it went really good. Those people
really got into it.

MR. TWEEK
Really?? Well, son, you might have just
saved the family business.What do you
have to say about that?

TWEEK
I need coffee.

MR. TWEEK
I know how you boys feel.  Sometimes
a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is
just what a man needs to get him through
the day. That smooth aroma and mild
taste is what make Tweek coffee...
uh very special. Special, like an Arizona
sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A
light rain in the middle of a dusty
afternoon or a hug from your dear old
aunt- .

TWEEK
Dad!

MR. TWEEK
What?

TWEEK
The metaphors, man!

MR. TWEEK
Oh, sorry. Here you go.

KYLE
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't
give your son coffee?

MRS. TWEEK
Liike, how do you mean?

KYLE
Like look at him. He's always shaking
and nervous.

TWEEK
Aaaaa!

MRS. TWEEK
Uhoh that. He has ADD, Attention Deficit
Disorder. That's why he's so jittery
all the time.

LADY MEMBER
Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard.

MR. TWEEK
Oh, hello committee members. What a
surprise.

LADY MEMBER
So, this is the corporate bulldozer
trying to push you off the map.

MR. TWEEK
Yes. How did you hear?

LADY MEMBER 2
These boys did an excellent report for
us this morning. They're so upset by
this whole thing

KYLE
My butt hurts.

LADY MEMBER
Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee
is not going to let you be run out of
business by these bastards! Do you hear
that? You're not gonna get away with
this, you whore!"

POSTEM
Excuse me?!

LADY MEMBER 2
Boys, we've talked it over, and we want
you to take your case to the mayor!


STAN
Our case?

TWEEK
Uuuuh, no way, man! That is way too
much pressure!

MR. TWEEK
Oh, you'll do fine, son.

LADY MEMBER 2
Come on, boys! Let's go!

CARTMAN
Aw, man, this sucks!

TWEEK
Aaarrrnnn!

[City Hall. Mr. Garrison is present with the boys and the town
committee]

LADY MEMBER
...And we would have never even known
that this was happening if not for these
boys' excellent report.

MAYOR
You're telling me that students from
Mr. Garrison's class actually did something
that had some kind of relevance to the
world?

LADY MEMBER
That's right.

MAYOR
Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?


LADY MEMBER
Yes!

MAYOR
Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps
you're not as stupid and crazy as I
always tell people you are.

MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound
like a dickhole, but I-

LADY MEMBER
Mayor, these boys want that Harbuck's
coffee shut down right now!

MALE MEMBER
Yeah!

LADY MEMBER 2
Hyeah!

MAYOR
Well, I can't just shut them down, this
is a free country.

LADY MEMBER
But they're ruining our city!

MAYOR
Look, the best I can do is create a
proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10.
The town can vote on it, and if it passes,
we'll see what we can do.

BLOND MEMBER
Hooray!

THE OTHER MEMBERS
Hooray!

LADY MEMBER
What do you say, boys? We're gonna
pass a law!

STAN
Uh. Hooray.

MAYOR
So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.
You can do commercials and things like
that, and then we'll have a vote in
the middle of town. And obviously, if
more than 50% of the people even show
up,

["Time to go to work, work all night

Search for underpants, hey!

We won't stop until we have underpants

Yum tum yummy tum day!

Time to go to work, work all night" The gnomes go up to Johnson
and pull his underpants out]

TWEEK
Waah!

MAYOR
"Search for underpants, hey!

We won't stop until we have..." A gnome tosses the underpants
to two others, who carry it away over their heads. They all leave]


...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So,
good luck to you. [the town committee leaves]

TWEEK
Didn't you see them!!

MAYOR
All right, what's next.

AIDE 2
Next is issue 37D, missing underpants.


JOHNSON
Is it cold in here?

MR. GARRISON
Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and
that with you? Boys, I don't know who
wrote that report, but now that you've
convinced everybody, you'd better stick
with it. 'Cause if these people find
out you didn't really write that paper,
and I actually do get fired, then Mr.
Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.
Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's REALLY
horrible! Anyway, good luck passing
your new law, boys.

TWEEK
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna
do, huh?!

HOST
Live, it's the South Park Town Hall
Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's
topic: Prop. 10.

MEDIATOR
Should Harbucks be allowed to open a
store in South Park? That's tonight's
topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed
boys from Middle America.  On my right,
a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from
New York.

AUDIENCE
Boo!

POSTEM
Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!

MEDIATOR
All right, Mr. Douchebag-

POSTEM
Postem!

MEDIATOR
Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assfaced. Anyway,
let's hear your side of the argument.


AUDIENCE
Boo!

POSTEM
My argument is simple. This country's
founded on free enterprise. Harbucks
is an organization that-.

AUDIENCE
Hhssssssss!

POSTEM
An organization that prides itself on
great coffee! We simply want tuh- Oh,
to hell with you!

MEDIATOR
Okay, Uckyoufay. Now for the other
side of the argument we turn to our
young, handsome lads.  Boys, your thoughts.
Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's
your principal argument?

KYLE
Uh.

STAN
Uh.

CARTMAN
This guy sucks ass!

AUDIENCE
Yeah! Yeah! Woo!

MEDIATOR
Great argument! You win, boys!

POSTEM
What?!

MR. GARRISON
That was close, Mr. Hat.

[The boys' first commercial, beginning with an American flag
waving, filling the screen]

VOICE-OVER
What is the future of America? Is it
the money we make?  The quests we conquer?
No, it's children.  So what do children
have to say about Prop. 10?

KYLE
I don't like big corportations.

STAN
I like small businesses.

CARTMAN
I believe in the family-owned enterprise.


KENNY
(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)


TWEEK
Aaaarh!

VOICEOVER
It's time to stop large corporations.
Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes
on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children.
You don't hate... children... Do you?
Remember, keep American business small,
or else.


[the kids' heads combust and only their skulls are left in flames,
with charred caps.]

Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks
Coffee kicked out of town forever.

[the TV clicks off, and evryone is in the studio]


LADY MEMBER
Well, what do you think?

MR. TWEEK
Wow, it it's great!

LADY MEMBER
Yes it is. We'll put it on the air
immediately.

MR. TWEEK
What do you think, hon?  Hon? What's
the matter?

MRS. TWEEK
I have a big problem with this!

MR. TWEEK
What do you mean?

MRS. TWEEK
We are just using those boys for our
benefit. They have no idea what they're
saying.

MR. TWEEK
But, kids are great to get people on
our side.

MRS. TWEEK
You don't just throw a child in a political
commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't
be a part of this anymore.

MR. TWEEK
Honey, all's fair in love and war.
And coffee. Hon? Hu- hon?

[Harbucks' grand opening. Protesters arrive]

LADY PROTESTER
Take your corporate coffee and go back
to New York City!

CROWD
YEAH!!

BLONDE PROTESTER
It's people like you who are ruining
Main Street, U.S.A.!!

CROWD
That's right! Yeah!

LADY PROTESTER
How many Native Americans did you slaughter
to make that coffee, huh?!

CROWD
YEAH!!

POSTEM
Damn, these people aren't buying any
coffee! I'll have to try and appeal
to the younger crowd!

[Later. The crowd now marches in front of Harbucks. To the right,
Harbucks' mascot, wearing a fez, holds a tray of coffee cups
topped with whipped cream before a boy]

POSTEM
Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love
a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious.
And it makes you feel super!  I have
a surprise for you: the new kiddicino
from Harbucks. More sugar and all the
other goodies kids like with all the
caffeine of a normal double latte.


KID'S MOM
No Billy. No coffee for you.  You should
be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons
to push caffeine on children!

POSTEM
Why don't you go back to the hole you
crawled out from, lady?!

MR. TWEEK
Uh, Mr. Postem, I'm afraid you've got
a lot to learn about making coffee.


POSTEM
Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes
like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!


MR. TWEEK
Uh I'm sorry to inform you that this
town is having a vote tomorrow, and
if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown
out of town.

POSTEM
What?!

MR. TWEEK
At five o'clock, the best coffee wins.
Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm
cup of... Tweek's coffee.  Like an old
sweater that keeps getting warmer with
age, you can count on Tweek's coffee
to start your day.

MAYOR
Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll
set up ballot booths ...here.  All right,
men, we'll throw up the stage here.
Before the vote we'll get a band everyone
likes, like uuuuhh, like...

JOHNSON
Toto.

MAYOR
Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy
will have five minutes to speak and
the boys will have five minutes to speak,
and then the town votes.

MR. GARRISON
Uh, boys, you better get your asses
to work.

CARTMAN
What now?

MR. GARRISON
They're expecting you to give a big
speech on corporate takeovers, and this
time it has to last five minutes.


KYLE
Oh, God, when is this gonna end?

STAN
Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!


TWEEK
Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this!
I'm to blame for everything!

[Tweek's house that night, Tweek's room. Tweek is on the floor
and the others are on his bed]

KYLE
So what are we gonna say?

CARTMAN
Why can't we just read the paper we
wrote last time?

STAN
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write
it, dummy! We have to be original!


KYLE
Does anybody know anything about corporations?



[the gnomes return, and Tweek gasps. The door opens and the gnomes
enter, singing their theme]

"Time to go to work, work all night

Search for underpants, hey!"


TWEEK
Waah!

CARTMAN
I think my mom is a corporation.

STAN
Yeah, that makes sense.

TWEEK
You guys! Sshhhh!

KYLE
Well, how about we just say, "corporates
should be stopped"?


"work all night

Search for underpants, hey!"

STAN
How do we stretch that into five minutes?


TWEEK
They're taking my underpants!

"We won't stop until we have underpants

Yum tum yummy tum day!"

KYLE
Will you stop with the underpants gnomes,
Tweek?! We have to here!

TWEEK
Aaaaaa!

"work all night

Search for underpants, hey!"

[They open the bottom drawer and go for the underpants]

STAN
What the hell?

CARTMAN
Well, I'll be damned.

TWEEK
That's my last pair of underpants!


["Time to go to work, work all night

Search for underpants, hey!" The gnomes go for the door, and
the boys hop off the bed to follow. One gnome stops and faces
the boys]

KYLE
Sshh, don't scare him.

STAN
Hey there, little guy.

CARTMAN
Bad!

KYLE
Cartman!

CARTMAN
What?!

KYLE
Why do you always have to hit stuff
with a stick?!

CARTMAN
Well, look at him. He's all, you know,
uh luh look at him.

GNOME
Is that all you've got, pussy?!

CARTMAN
What?!

STAN
Hey, he talks!

CARTMAN
Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not
a pussy, you're a pussy!

GNOME
You're a pussy, pussy!

CARTMAN
Ey!

STAN
Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?


KYLE
Yeah, look what you're doing to this
poor kid.

TWEEK
Waaaah.

GNOME
Stealing underpants biiig business.


STAN
Business? Wait, do you know anything
about business?

GNOME
Sure, that's what gnomes do.

KYLE
Show us.

GNOME
O-kay. Follow me.

CARTMAN
Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a
pussy, pussy gnome.

[The woods. The gnome leads them on to his cave]

GNOME
Not much longer now.

CARTMAN
Oh, are you gonna take us to your little
pussy house?

GNOME
No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village.


CARTMAN
Oh, your pussy village?

STAN
Cartman, will you just shut up and let
him show us?!

GNOME
Follow me.

CARTMAN
I hope we're not wasting our time with
this little pecker.

[Starbucks, early morn. Workers put on the finishing touches
to the coffee store]

POSTEM
William, it looks like Harbucks will
never make it in this town.  All right,
boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin'
out of town.

WORKER 1
Aw, but we just finished.

POSTEM
I know, but these folks obviously don't
want us here.

WORKER 2
But what will become of us?

POSTEM
Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez.
Jesus Christ.

[underground. The boys are still following the gnome]

STAN
Damn, dude, this place is huge!

KYLE
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's
ass.

CARTMAN
No it isn't, you guys!

GNOME
This is where all our work is done.


CARTMAN
So what are you gonna do with all these
underpants that you steal?

GNOME
Collecting underpants is just phase
1. Phase 1: collect underpants.

KYLE
Sooo, what's phase 2?

GNOME
Hey, what's phase 2?

GNOME 2
Phase 1: we collect underpants.

GNOME
Yeah yeah yeah, but. What about phase
2?

GNOME 2
Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?

STAN
I don't get it.

GNOME 2
You see,

PHASE 1
collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase
3: Profit.

CARTMAN
Oh, I get it.

STAN
No you don't, fatass!

KYLE
Do you guys know anything about corporations?


GNOME
You bet we do!

GNOME 2
Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.


GNOMES


Time to go to work, work all night

Se-

CENTER GNOME
Jesus Christ, look out!

STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.

KYLE
You bastards. Listen, we have to give
a huge speech tomorrow about corporate
takeovers.

GNOME
Holy shit! We've killed your friend.


STAN
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know
about corporate takeovers tomorrow or
we're screwed.

GNOME 2
Christ, we squished him like a bug.


STAN
Do you know anything about corporate
takeovers?

GNOME
Well, we can explain that to you easily.


GNOME 2
Yes, for a price.

KYLE
What?

GNOME
You know.

STAN
Underpants?

GNOMES
Underpants!

[Harbucks, daytime. Prop. 10 supporters are out in force and
Toto is performing.]

LADY MEMBER
Toto, ladies and gentlemen!

PROP. 10 SUPPORTER
Yeah, Toto, woo, Toto! Woo!

LADY MEMBER
All right. And now, before we all vote
yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why
are the lovable, innocent children.


STAN
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the
corporate takeovers, we went and asked
our friends, the underpants gnomes,
and they told us all about big corporations.


SUPPORTER
Underpants gnomes?

KYLE
Big corporations are good!

SUPPORTER
What?

SUPPORTER 2
What's this?

SUPPORTER 3
Good?

KYLE
Because without big corporations we
wouldn't have things like cars and computers
and canned soup.

STAN
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as
a small, little business. But because
it made such great coffee, and because
they ran their business so well, they
managed to grow and grow until it became
the corporate powerhouse it is today.
And that is why we should all let Harbucks
stay!

TOWNSMAN
:	Ogh.

LADY MEMBER
That's not what you said last time!


KYLE
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't
write that paper last time.

MR. GARRISON
You little turds!! You've ruined my
life for the last time!!

MRS. TWEEK
These boys are absolutely right. We've
been using these poor kids to pull at
your heartstrings for our cause, and
it's wrong. We're as low and despicable
as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and
complaining, but did any of you ever
even bother to taste Harbucks coffee?
Harbucks coffee got to where it is
by being the best. Don't you think you
should at least try it?

TOWNSMAN
Hey, this is pretty damn good.

TOWNSMAN 2
Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw,
sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has.


MR. TWEEK
Hey. Hey, that is good.

POSTEM
It's a French roast.

MR. TWEEK
It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that
first splash of sun on an April morning.
This coffee is coffee the way it should
be.

POSTEM
Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You
know, we still need someone to run this
Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will
make a lo-o-ot of money.

MR. TWEEK
Thank you, Mr. Postem, but I think we'll
be happy with the money we make selling
our son into slavery.

TWEEK
AAaAaha!

MR. TWEEK
Just kidding, son.

CARTMAN
I love you guys.

"SCOTT TENORMAN MUST DIE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Morning in South Park. Cartman is riding his Big Wheels down
the road, singing to himself. He soon reaches the bus stop. Stan,
Kyle, and Kenny are standing there]

CARTMAN
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya
da dadaa

Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa, heydy heydy heydy, how's it goin',
guys?

KYLE
What the hell are you so happy about,
fatass?!

CARTMAN
Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.


STAN
What's no big deal?

CARTMAN
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first
one of us to reach manhood after all.


KYLE
...What the hell are you talking about?!


CARTMAN
Well, becuase, unlike you guys, I just
got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee!


KENNY
(You got pubes??)

KYLE
What's "pubes"?

STAN
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first
pubic hair.

KYLE
Oh.  No you didn't!

CARTMAN
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!

STAN
He's lying.

CARTMAN
You wanna see 'em?

KYLE
Hell no!

CARTMAN
Here, check 'em out.

STAN
We don't wanna see them, Cartman!


CARTMAN
There, see?! How do you like  apples!
HA!

KYLE
Uh what are those?

CARTMAN
My pubes

STAN
What??

CARTMAN
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.

KYLE
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?

CARTMAN
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten
bucks. Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you
guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys!
Ahahahahahahaa ha!

STAN
Cartman, you are so Goddamned stupid
it's unbelievable.

CARTMAN
Don't be jealous, guys.  This doesn't
mean we can't still hang out.  It just
means that I matured faster than you.
You'll get your pubes guys, someday.


KYLE
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow
them yourself!

CARTMAN
Uh oo what?

STAN
When you get old enough, you grow your
own pubic hair that's attached to you,
you fuckin' dumbass!

CARTMAN
Nuh uh!

KYLE
Yuh huh!

CARTMAN
But then why would Scott Tenorman sell
me his pubes for ten dollars?

KYLE
Because, retard, you're dumb enough
to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten
dollars!

CARTMAN
You're telling me these pubes are worth
nothing.

KYLE
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Huh I'm gonna get that sonofabitch.


[a lavender house, day. Three teens sit on the front steps]


SCOTT
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll
sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."
And this stupid asshole buys them!


ANOTHER BOY
Oh man!

SCOTT
Speak of the devil! What do you want?


CARTMAN
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes
that I purchased, please?

SCOTT
Uh uh, I don't take returns!

CARTMAN
Right, but you see, I didn't realize,
when I bought these pubes from you,
that you were full of shit! So you can
either give me back my ten dollars,
or I can go tell my mom on you!

SCOTT
You would actually tell your mom that
you were stupid enough to pay for my
pubes? Huh uh, I don't think soho!


CARTMAN
Just give me back my money...

SCOTT
Buyer beware, dude!

CARTMAN
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!

SCOTT
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little
butt out of here before I kick your
head in!

[Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell]

CARTMAN
Hello, sir, my name is Kris Kristoferssen.
I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect
ten dollars that you own in back taxes


SCOTT
You're not from the IRS! You glued my
pubes onto your face!

CARTMAN
Tax evasion is a very serious offense,
sir! I suggest that you...

SCOTT
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes
back for the money.

CARTMAN
You will? Oh, cool!

SCOTT
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah.
Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?


CARTMAN
Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars
and twelve cents.

SCOTT
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just...
give me the six dollars.  And then I'll...
give you the twenty.

CARTMAN
...Okay.

SCOTT
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give
you back two dollars.

CARTMAN
Right.

SCOTT
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll
give you the rest of your change back.


CARTMAN
Cool.

SCOTT
And then give me the twenty, and I'll
give you the pubes.

CARTMAN
Sweet!  Uh. Oh, God-damnit!

[Bijou movie house, later. The boys are going to see a "BIG WAR
MOVIE"]

CARTMAN
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin'
asshole! I'm goona get him!

KYLE
Carman, can I give you some advice?


CARTMAN
What?!

KYLE
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen
dollars and twelve cents. Count all
your losses and move on. He's smarter
than you.

Cartman!	He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's
all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!!
[the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets]

KYLE
One please.

STAN
One please.

KENNY
(One please.)

CARTMAN
One please.

CLERK
That'll be six dollars

CARTMAN
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?


CLERK
We don't take pubes!

CARTMAN
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's!
Don't you, uh, discriminate against
my people by not accepting these pubes


CLERK
We don't take pubes!! End of story!!


CARTMAN
Racist!

[Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell again]

CARTMAN
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South
Park! She's all drunk and spreading
her legs and showing her poonanner to
everybody! You gotta go check it out!
I'll watch your house for ya!

SCOTT
Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!


CARTMAN
What?

SCOTT
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even
throw in an extra five! Here! Give me
back my pubes!

CARTMAN
Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back
so much?

SCOTT
No reason.

CARTMAN
I don't believe you.

SCOTT
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort
Collins.

CARTMAN
Pube fair?

SCOTT
They're paying five bucks a hair for
pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the
last bus!

CARTMAN
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like
a million dollars!

SCOTT
Hehere, take your money!

CARTMAN
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going
to Fort Collins myself!

SCOTT
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!


CARTMAN
Haha, charade you are, Scott!

SCOTT
Have you no heart??

[Bus Terminal, day. Cartman stands in line waiting for a trip
to Fort Collins. People are boarding the bus]

CARTMAN
Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha!


[Bus, evening. The sun has already set and Cartman is still on
the bus, en route to Fort Collins]

CARTMAN
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew!
Ow!

[Fort Collins, night. Cartman gets off the bus and walks]

CARTMAN
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me,
sir.

MAN
Yes?

CARTMAN
Can you tell me where the pube fair
is?

MAN
The pube fair?

CARTMAN
Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.

MAN
There's no such thing, you little smartass!


CARTMAN
No- no such thing?

TEEN BOY
Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric
Cartman, would you?

CARTMAN
I'm Eric Cartman!

TEEN BOY
Well, I think this is for you.

CARTMAN
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

[Scott's house, night. Cartman rings the doorbell again, this
time in the rain. Scott answers. Cartman is soaked with rain,
his beanie wrinkling]

CARTMAN
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had
to ride a hundred and six miles in the
back of a pickup truck... to get back
here

SCOTT
You really went? What a 'tard.

CARTMAN
Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.


SCOTT
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as
I thought.

CARTMAN
Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is
too bad about my grandma, though...


SCOTT
Your grandma?

CARTMAN
Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your
soncern, since uh-... well, my grandma's
in the hospital. She's very sick. The
doctors say unless I can come up with
sixteen dollars for her operation, they're
gonna put her down.

SCOTT
Oh.  Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.


CARTMAN
Yeah. Poor grandma...

SCOTT
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah,
I'll get yoru money.

CARTMAN
Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh.


SCOTT
Here you go.

CARTMAN
Oh, wow, thankts a lot, Scott!

SCOTT
But... just one thing before I give
it to you:

CARTMAN
What?

SCOTT
I just... well... I want you to beg
for it.

CARTMAN
Huh?

SCOTT
Just... get down on your knees and-
beg me for the money.

CARTMAN
Why??

SCOTT
Do you want your grandma to live or
not?!

CARTMAN
Please Scott give me my money.

SCOTT
Nono, get down on your knees.  Lower
your head , and say "I beg you to give
me back my money."

CARTMAN
I beg you to give me back my money.


SCOTT
Now say, "I'm a little piggy."

CARTMAN
What?!

SCOTT
Say it!

CARTMAN
I'm a little piggy.

SCOTT
"Here's my snout."

CARTMAN
Here's my snout.

SCOTT
"Oink oink oink."

CARTMAN
Oink oink oink.

SCOTT
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink
for me!

CARTMAN


I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.

Oink oink oink, oink oink oink. [Scott begins to laugh]

I'm a little piggy; here's- Aalrightalrightalright, now give
me back my money!

SCOTT
You mean this?  You really care that
much about sixteen measly dollars? I
mean, what can you buy with sixteen
dollars?! My parents give me a fifty
dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance
means nothing to me. Watch.

CARTMAN
What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?


SCOTT
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money!


CARTMAN
Noooooooooo! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie!
...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!

[Cartman's house, cellar. The kids in class has been reunited
for something important. They're chattering amongst themselves]


CARTMAN
Concerned citizens, I thank you for
coming.  I know that you are all deeply
troubled and want to find a quick and
painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman
once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!

CLYDE
Who's Scott Tenorman?

KIDS
Yeah.

KYLE
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who
sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars,
and now Cartman's all pissed off.


CARTMAN
Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He
is a disease. He is a cold calculating
mind, and I will have revenge!

BUTTERS
Wuh what are you gonna do?

CARTMAN
Did you guys see that movie Hannibal?
Where the deformed guy trained giants
pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well,
if we find a pony , we can train it.
Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's
weiner.  It will be painful and humiliating!
Everyone will see it happen! And then,
Scott Tenorman will forever be known
as the kid who had his weiner bitten
off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!

KYLE
What's in it for us?

CARTMAN
What?

STAN
Yeah, why should we all care about getting
Scott Tenorman back for you?

CARTMAN
Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes,
why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's
just let Scott Tenorman walk away with
my sixteen dollars and twelve cents.
Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans
of the world take what's ours and laugh
in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves
when you can just walk out of here right
now and say, "It's not your problem."
But... years from now, when you're old
and have children of your own, what
would you give to come back and fight
this one day? This one day, when you
could have made a difference! Where
you could have told Scott Tenorman,
"You may take our pride, but you'll
naver take my Goddamned sixteen dollars
and twelve cents!!"  Now who's with
me?!!

TIMMY
Timmay!

CARTMAN
Christ. Alright, I guess it's just
you and me, Timmy!

TIMMY
Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih.

[A barn, day. Cartman stands next to a scarecrow. He pulls out
a frank from a bag of weiners and places it in the scarecrow's
crotch]

CARTMAN
There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come
on, pony, bite the weiner. Bite it.
Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now,
bite it off! Bite off the weiner! Good
pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.


JIMBO
Eric! Are you training that pony to
plese you?!

CARTMAN
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite
someone's penis off.

JIMBO
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're
usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers
on sight, you know.

CARTMAN
He said it was okay.

JIMBO
Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are
you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off
someone's penis?

CARTMAN
Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him!
And I want to make him suffer!

JIMBO
Well, son, I think you have a pretty
stupid plan there.

CARTMAN
Not like that, pony!

JIMBO
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody,
you've gotta think like a hunter.


CARTMAN
Whattayou mean?

JIMBO
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step
2: exploit that weakness.

CARTMAN
How do I do that?

[Scott's house, night. Cartman appears in the bushes across the
street. He pulls out binoculars and checks out the various rooms
in the house. He sees Scott in his room, with Radiohead posters
on his wall]

JIMBO
What do you see?

CARTMAN
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger
red hair and his stupid freckles and
his- Goaddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!


JIMBO
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you
see? You must learn all you can about
your kill.

CARTMAN
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters.
Radiohead posters! And he's reading
a magazine about Radiohead!

JIMBO
Oo what's a Radiohead?

CARTMAN
You know, that band that sings that
song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...


NED
Mmuh what am I doing here?

JIMBO
Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!


CARTMAN
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan,
huh? Maybe I should come up with a
li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.


JIMBO
Nice thinking, young hunter.

CARTMAN
Whoa!

JIMBO
What?

CARTMAN
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room.
Scott's mom's about to take off her
bra.

JIMBO
What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's
right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin'
the twins out!

NED
Mn let me see.

CARTMAN
Radiohead. Yes, of course.

JIMBO
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever
imagined!

NED
Let me see. Let me see.

JIMBO
Here you go.  Wow, those are great.
Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned.
Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?

NED
Kinda.

JIMBO
Well, stop it!

MR. TENORMAN
Hey, what the hell are you doing out
there?!

JIMBO
Oh crap!

MR. TENORMAN
Who's out there?

JIMBO
Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!


NED
I can't.

MR. TENORMAN
Don't think I don't see you! I know
who you are and I'm calling the police!


A MAN
Whoa, I gotta get out of here!

[Scott's house, the next day. Cartman returns yet again and rings
the doorbell. Scott answers.]

CARTMAN
Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was
just wondering, do you like the band,
uh, Radiohead at all?

SCOTT
Uh huh.

CARTMAN
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin'
a big interview on MTV, and they're
playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.
Everyone's gonna be there!

SCOTT
Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.


CARTMAN
You're welcome, Scott.

[Downtown South Park, night. Cartman stands on a small stage
as a crowd gathers. On stage is a big-screen TV and tower speakers]


CARTMAN
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is
here. Let's play the video, shall we?


KURT LODER
Welcome back to MTV. We're here with
the members from Radiohead, probably
the hottest band in the world right
now.  Guys, when is the next album coming
out?

CARTMAN
That's an interesting question, Kurt.
But first I'd just like to say that
I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman.
He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman
too.  I think all the guys in the band
hate him, right guys?

CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?


KURT LODER
And will there be a new tour?

CARTMAN
Well, we would tour, but we just hate
that Scott Tenorman kid so much that
we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman
is totally not cool! He's not cool!


CARTMAN
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.
Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see
that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed!
Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That
wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just
dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!
What a retard!  And now everyone saw
it!

SCOTT
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
it's time for the amazing Pube Boy!


CARTMAN
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.

STAN
Oh my God, he killed Kenny.

CARTMAN
That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman
once and for all!!!

[That night, dark and stormy, appropriate for Cartman's mood
at the moment, Cartman's house. A boy possessed, he's in his
room devising a new plan. An evil look comes across his face]


CARTMAN
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott
Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel
after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then...
that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is
the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman
is going to wish he never met meee!!!


[Mr. Denkins' farm, next day. Cartman is back at the corral waiting
for his friends. Stan and Kyle walk up.]

KYLE
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?

CARTMAN
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have
it all figured out!

STAN
Got what all figured out?

CARTMAN
How to get Scott Tenorman back!

KYLE
Oh, Jesus!

CARTMAN
I just finished planning a brilliant
li'l scheme  that should put Scott
in his place for good! And if you help
me, I'll give each of you... two...
dollars.

KYLE
Okay, so what's the plan?

CARTMAN
It's the brilliant combination of my
last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite
band is Radiohead, right?

STAN
Yeah.

CARTMAN
So, I realized, "What if we got Radiohead
to come here to South Park?" right?
Then they could meet Scott Tenorman
 and  see him get his weiner bitten
off by a pony!

KYLE
...What?

CARTMAN
Don't you see? If I can get this pony
to bite off Scott's weiner in front
of Radiohead, then Scott would cry.
And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will
say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool!
And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna
die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the
pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play
here! Ready? Break!!

KYLE
You're such a dumbass, Cartman.

CARTMAN
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys
just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!
Yes!!

[London Recording Studio, day. Inside, Radiohead prepares to
record. One of them is on the floor reading fan mail]

JOHNNY
Thom, will you stop reading fan mail?
We have work to do.

THOM
Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:


Dear Radiohead,


My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy
from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid
I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid
he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and
it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts
to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please
consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday
around 5.

PHIL
Wow, we have to go.

ED
To Colorado? But we have an album to
mix.

THOM
Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor
kid has cancer! In his ass!

[Scott's house, day. A phone rings. Scott answers it in the living
room.]

SCOTT
Hello?

KYLE
Scott Tenorman?

SCOTT
What do you want?!

KYLE
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman,
the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try
and trick you somehow into getting your
weiner bitten off by a pony who lives
at Denkins' ranch.

SCOTT
How do you know?

KYLE
'Cause, we're his friends.

SCOTT
Thennn why are you telling me?

KYLE
'Cause we hate him.

SCOTT
Oh.

KYLE
Well, we just thought we'd let you know.
See ya.

SCOTT
See ya.

[At the front door]

CARTMAN
Hello, Scott!

SCOTT
Hey.

CARTMAN
I was just stopping by to invite you
to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili
cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming,
and I wanted to drop by your invitation
personally!

SCOTT
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds
great.

CARTMAN
Yeah! There is even gonna be a big
surprise, so you won't wanna miss it,
Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon
good for one free pony ride!

SCOTT
Wow, a pony ride. Neat.

CARTMAN
Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.

SCOTT
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What
more could I want?

CARTMAN
A little penis-biting, perhaps?

SCOTT
What?

CARTMAN
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come
for sure then, Scott?

SCOTT
How can I turn it down?

CARTMAN
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho,
you are good, Eric. You are very, very
good.

[back in the living room]

SCOTT
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric
at the door? He told me that there's
a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's
been abandoned.

MOM
Oh dear.

SCOTT
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't
know how I can help it, because I have
a lot of homework to do.

DAD
:	 Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your
mom and I can go get the pony and have
it taken to an animal shelter.

MOM
We sure can.

SCOTT
Wow, would you really? I feel so much
better now.

MOM
Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring
boy. I'm so proud of you.

SCOTT
I'm proud of you, too, Mom.

MOM
Let's go, hon.

DAD
Let's.

[In the kitchen. Scott is cooking up something... his friends
arrive]

BUDDY 1
What are you doing, Scott?

SCOTT
What's it look like? I'm making chili.
Did you bring the goods?

BUDDY 2
We got everyone we could find to chip
in.  There are pubes from just about
every single kid in town.

SCOTT
Awesome!

BUDDY 1
Oh, dude!

SCOTT
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna
get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how
he likes it when I tell him he just
ate the pubes of every kid in town!


BUDDY 2
Yeah!

[South Park, next day. The Chili Con Carnival is in full swing.
People have already arrived. Stan and Kyle walk up]

CARTMAN
Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming
to my Chili Con Carnival!

STAN
This is the dumbest thing you've ever
done, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott
Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay
to see the fireworks!

KYLE
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss
this.

CARTMAN
What's so funny?

STAN
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're
gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead
here yet?

CARTMAN
Not yet, but they will be.

KYLE
Yeah, sure.

CHEF
Hello, Eric!

CARTMAN
Hey, Chef.

CHEF
I made some chili to enter into the
contest.

CARTMAN
What contest?

CHEF
This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?


CARTMAN
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here,
Chef, just put it over here.

CHEF
It's my special recipe.

CARTMAN
Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott?
Thanks so much for coming!

SCOTT
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.


CARTMAN
Likewise. Well, come on, you've got
to see the pony!

SCOTT
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste
my chili first?

CARTMAN
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special
guest coming, and I want you to be near
the pony when they arrive.

SCOTT
Well I don't want it to get cold. I
think I can win first prize.

CARTMAN
Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to
the judging table and we'll try the
chili first.  Goddamnit!

[Cartman's house, the judging table. Cartman and Scott take their
seats. Behind Scott stand Butters, Kyle, Stan, and Scott's friends.
Behind Cartman stand Bebe, Clyde, and Token]

SCOTT
Alright, I guess we should taste each
other's chili, huh?

CARTMAN
Huh, this chili looks pretty good.
Weh, here's mine.

SCOTT
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is
pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine
is better. Try it.

CARTMAN
Alright.  Hey, this is great!

SCOTT
Eh, it's a special recipe

CARTMAN
Gawh, this is really good, Scott!


SCOTT
I'm glad you like it so much, because
now that you're almost finished, I have
some'in' to tell you.

CARTMAN
What? You mean about how you put pubes
in your chili?

SCOTT
What?!

CARTMAN
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili,
Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's
delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on
that. What I did plan on, however, was
that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would
betray me and warn you that the Chili
Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed
that they would tell you that I had
trained Denkins' pony to bite off your
weiner. What they didn't tell you was
that Denkins is a crazy redneck who
shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing
that you would try and do somethng to
the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that
violent pony killers were in the area.
I also know that you wouldn't go yourself,
for fear of having your weiner bitten
off. You would most likely send your
parents.  And, I'm afraid that when
Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property,
he shot and killed both your parents.


MR. DENKINS
Well, they was trespassin' and I was
protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.


SCOTT
My... mom and dad are... dead?

CARTMAN
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins
giving his report to Officer Barbrady.
And of course, to steal the bodies...
After a night with the hacksaw, I was
all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival,
so that I could tell you personally
about your parents' demise! And of course,
feed you your chili.  Do you like it?
Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, "Mr.
& Mrs. Tenorman Chili."

SCOTT
Oh my God!  Oh my God!!

CARTMAN
Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made
you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah
nyah nyah!

STAN
Jesus Christ, dude!

SCOTT
My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!!


THOM
Uhm, excuse me?

STAN
Who are you?

JOHNNY
We're that band, Radiohead.

SCOTT
Jesus!

ED
Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!

COLIN
Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??


THOM
You know, everyone has problems; it
doesn't mean you have to be a little
crybaby about it.

ED
Come om, guys, let's go. This kid is
totally not cool.

THOM
Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've
ever met.

PHIL
Little crybaby!

SCOTT
No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh
my Gaawwwd!!  Noooo!

CARTMAN
Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your
tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so
yummy and sweet.

KYLE
Dude, I think it might be best for us
to never piss Cartman off again.

STAN
Good call.

CARTMAN
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness!
My-ymmuy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  Yuppitibut,
that's all, folks!

"THE DEATH CAMP OF TOLERANCE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Principal Victoria's office, day. Her door opens.]

MR. GARRISON
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat.  Mr.
Garrison, sometime ago you asked to
be promoted from teachng kindergarten
back to the third grade.

MR. GARRISON
I'm aware of that.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I wanna come clean with you and tell
you that back then some of us were uncomfortable
with your sexual preferences. It was
wrong of us, and I want to make it up
to you.

MR. GARRISON
Wow, that's... really great to hear.


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
As you know, the position of Fourth
Grade teacher has become available,
and we'd like to offer YOU the job.


MR. GARRISON
Oh, for real? You're not kidding?


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We in administration see now that you
are an individual with your own preferences,
and we respect that.

MR. GARRISON
Hoh, this is all just... this is a
dream come true!  Thank you, Principal
Victoria! I'll do a great jub!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I know you will.

MR. GARRISON
You're sure this is for real? I mean,
I'm not gonna just get fired again for
being gay tomorrow.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
It's for real, Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Oh-ho, great!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
With all the new laws we could never
fire you for being gay now. You'd be
able to sue us for millions of dollars.


MR. GARRISON
Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, I was just saying that the policies
have really changed. You know, we fire
you for acting gay next time, you'd
be able to sue the school district for
...lots of money.

MR. GARRISON
...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-...
how much money, exactly?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh. Well, there was the case out in
Minnesota where the guy was awarded...
25 million, I think.

MR. GARRISON
Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh,
Principal Victoria.  Holy Moley! I've
gotta find a way to get fired for being
gay!

[South Park Elementary]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks
have been really hard with the death
of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik.


KYLE
Funny.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
BUT... the principal has finally hired
a teacher to take her place. So I want
you all to give your best behavior to
your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison.


KIDS
AWWWW!!!

KYLE
Not him!

MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Mr. Mackey.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Good luck, m'kay.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, now for those of you
whoare new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.


BUTTERS
Where is Mr. Hat, sir?

MR. GARRISON
Well, I was informed that fourth graders
are a little too old for Mr. Hat.


KYLE
Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.


MR. GARRISON
But it's okay because I found a new
teacher's assistant. Say hello to...
Mr. Slave.

MR. SLAVE
Hi kids. Hm.

MR. GARRISON
So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's
assitant.  Or, as I like to write for
short, the Teacher's Ass.

MR. SLAVE
Oh Jesus Christ.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need
you.

MR. SLAVE
Ugh.

CARTMAN
Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might
by a...  Pakistani.

MR. GARRISON
I'm not saying the rest of the school
year will be easy. In fact, it's going
to be long and hard.  Really long and
really hard.

MR. SLAVE
Oh Jesus Christ.

MR. GARRISON
Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be
learning about is communist Russia.


CARTMAN
No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?


MR. GARRISON
Now, Stalin was a big silly when it
came to...

CARTMAN
Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny!

MR. GARRISON
Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!


CARTMAN
No, it was Kenny!

MR. GARRISON
Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!

STAN
Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains,
and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's
body.

THE OTHER KIDS
Yeah.

MR. GARRISON
That does it! I will not put up with
foolishness in my class! It's time for
punishmenmt!  Take it Mr. Slave!


MR. SLAVE
Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.

MR. GARRISON
I will  NOT put up with  TOMfoolery
in my  CLASSroom, children.  Mr. Slave,
put this rubber ball in your mouth.
Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll
get me fired for sure.

[The Marsh house, afternoon. The Tweeks, the Stotches, the Marshes,
the Broflovskis, and Liane are present in the living room, seated
around the coffee table.]

KYLE'S FATHER
I really enjoyed the imagery in the
last chapter of this month's book.


LINDA
Yes, and I really saw the entire book
thematically as a take on corporate
America.

RANDY
Well I think in the fourth chapter,
when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody
glove in the cheerleader's locker, well
that uh that was just a brilliantly
written passage.

KYLE'S FATHER
So full of metaphor.

KYLE
Hey guys, can we talk to you?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, hi boys.

SHARON
How was school?

KYLE
Uhh, not cool.

KYLE'S MOTHER
That's great. We're having our book
of the month club meeting, so why don't
you boys go outside and play?

LINDA
Was it me, or did you all think that
Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant
Mountain a little too easily?

STAN
No, no, he said not cool. We got our
new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison,
our old third grade teacher.

CHRIS
Uh huh.

KYLE
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant,
and uh and they're both... totally gay.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate
against homosexuals!

STAN
Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.


RANDY
Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I
really thought you knew how to accept
people for what they were.

SHARON
Yeah, but Dad-

RANDY
No buts, Stanley! We're not raising
our kids to be discriminators!

KYLE'S MOTHER
That's right! I think it's time you
kids took a little trip to the Museum
of Tolerance!

[Museum of Tolerance, next day. A really modern building with
a fountain by the entrance. The five boys and their parents arrive
at the museum]

TOUR GUIDE
Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance.
Here we try to educate you on the dynamics
of racism and prejudice in America.


CARTMAN
Ey!

TOUR GUIDE
Now, did you know that words we use
can show intolerance?  Let's begin our
tour with a walk through our Tunnel
of Prejudice, to show you what it can
feel like to be discriminated against.


VOICE
QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB.
FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE.

CARTMAN
Aw man, this is awesome!

TOUR GUIDE
Now you know how it feels.

CARTMAN
I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!


TOUR GUIDE
We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes.
These wax figures represent how some
intolerant people have labled minorities.
Here we see a black person eating chicken
and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts
the African-American community. What
other stereotypes do you see here?


RANDY
Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist.


TOUR GUIDE
That's right. But of course, we know
that all Arabs are terrorirsts, don
we, kids?

BUTTERS
W-w-well there's an Asian over there
with a calculator.

TOUR GUIDE
That's right. Not all stereotypes are
negative. But even a positive one like
"All Asians are good at math" is harmful
to society.

CARTMAN
Look, a covetous Jew!

TOUR GUIDE
Very good, young man. The idea that
Jews are only interested in money is
very old indeed.

RANDY
Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical
"sleepy Mexican."

JANITOR
Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it?


RANDY
Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a
wax sculpture.

JANITOR
Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose
to be cleaning but I'm so tire. Ongh,
so sleepy.

TOUR GUIDE
This is our discovery wing. Take your
time at the computer displays , because
you see, being tolerant you must also
respect people who are small, people
who are disabled, even people who are
overweight,  like this young man here.


CARTMAN
Ey!

TOUR GUIDE
You other boys have probably called
this young man names like "tubby," or
"lardbutt," or "fat tits,"...

KYLE
"Fat tits." That's a good one.

STAN
Yeah, I have to remember that.

TOUR GUIDE
But you must learn to be tolerant of
his differences as well. If he chooses
to eat fatty foods, that's his life
choice.

CARTMAN
I'm not fat, I have a different life
choice.

TOUR GUIDE
And we won't belittle you for eating
lots of cookies and cakes and pies.


CARTMAN
Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass!

RANDY
That's our Cartman.

[Museum of Tolerance, outside.]

TOUR GUIDE
Well, that's the end of our tour.

RANDY
Now do you see why tolerance is so important,
boys?

STAN
I guess.

TOUR GUIDE
We have to accept people for who they
are and what they like to do.  Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

SMOKER
Oh I was just uh-

TOUR GUIDE
There's no smoking in the museum!

SMOKER
But I'm not in the museum.

TOUR GUIDE
Get out of here, you filthy smoker!


KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah, dirty lungs!

SHARON
Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!


CHRIS
Dumbass!

RICHARD
Get out of here!

TOUR GUIDE
Well, have a great day, everybody.


CHRIS
Now you boys can go and give your teacher
and assistant the respect they deserve.
Right?

THE BOYS
Yeah.

[South Park Elementary, day, Garrison's class. Mr. Garrison enters,
having previously set up a chemistry experiment on the teacher's
desk.]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats.
Uh, apparently, none of you tried to
get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're
just gonna have to go on and learn more
today.  Now who can tells me what happens
to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen
burner?

BUTTERS
It evaporates.

MR. GARRISON
Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass
tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also
see how other things react.  Evaporation
is an exothermic reaction, so let's
look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave,
position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put
the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight
ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass
will act as our new conductor of energy


MR. SLAVE
AAH.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over
Lemmiwinks for me please?

BUTTERS
Sure.

STAN
Oh, no, noo, no no no no.

MR. GARRISON
Newton was the first to discover that
for every action there's a reaction
- thank you Butters. Now what do you
think is gonna happen when I introduce
the element of the gerbil to the endothermic
heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's
see.

MR. SLAVE
AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!


BUTTERS
Lemmiwinks? NO!

[South Park Elementary, lunch time. The kids go for their lunches]


CHEF
Hello there, children!

THE BOYS
Hey Chef.

CHEF
How's it goin'?

KYLE
Bad.

CHEF
Why bad?

STAN
Chef, we're intolerant.

CHEF
...Intolerant of who?

KYLE
Gays, I guess.

CHEF
Now why do you wanna go be intolerant
of gay people, children?  I thought
you knew better.

STAN
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr.
Garrison has this new assistant, and
we're really uncomfortable around him.


CHEF
Children, a lot of times the reason
get uncomfortable around gay people
is that they have some issues themselves.
You have to ask yourself, "What is it
about their behavior that, for some
reason, makes me unconfortable?"

KYLE
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr.
Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's
ass.

CHEF
Right. And you see, children, that's
why you need to- Whoa! What?!

STAN
Are we homophobes now?

KYLE
We don't wanna be gaybashers, Chef.


CHEF
Children, there's a BIG difference between
gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you
understand that??

STAN
N-no?

CHEF
You children just take your lunches.
I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.


CARTMAN
I'll take three lunches today, please.


CHEF
You don't need three lunches, Eric!
You're fat enough as it is!


It is my life choice, Chef, and if you
don't tolerate it I'll report you to
the SEC.

[Fourth Grade classroom. The chemistry equipment has been cleared
away from the teacher's desk. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are
in the classroom]

MR. GARRISON
That was a brilliant idea, having me
put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.
Now we'll get fired for sure!

MR. SLAVE
Well it wasn't the first small animal
I put up my ass.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison to the principal's office,
please?

MR. GARRISON
That's it! They're gonna fire me for
being gay! Twenty-five million here
we cooome.

MR. SLAVE
Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh,
Jesus Christ.

FROG KING
Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out
of this place, or you will surely die.
This way has been closed off by the
Great Sphincter. To escape you must
journey upward to the dark reaches of
the intestine and past the stomach.
Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words,
Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out.
Make for the large intestine. All will
be made clear then.

SINGER
A great adventure is waiting for you
ahead.

Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.

The journy before you may be long and filled with woe

But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.



Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-

[The principal's office, a few moments later. Mr. Garrison hums
as he nears the office door. He enters and stands beside an angry
Chef, who has crossed his arms.]

MR. GARRISON
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat


MR. GARRISON
Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired.


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to
my attention that some uh students are
a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain
aspects of your teaching meathods.


MR. GARRISON
Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I
can't stop being who I am. I can't help
the way God made me. Guess I just have
to go.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Nonono we're not firing you.

MR. GARRISON
...You're not?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance
seminar.

CHEF
Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?!
You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You demostrate a lack of tolerance for
Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I
believe you used the words "sick queer"
to describe his conduct in class?


CHEF
He IS a sick queer!!

MR. GARRISON
Yeah!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I just wanted to give you an opportunity
to apologize to Mr. Garrison before
I send you away, Chef.

CHEF
Kiss my black ass!!

[South Park Elenentary, Counselor Mackey's office]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Parents, I had to call you in here because
your boys have refused to attend class
with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?


STAN
We're not staying in class another minute
with those queermos!

RANDY
Well I really thought you boys really
learned something in the Museum of Tolerance,
but apparently all you learned was new
words to call your poor teachers!


BUTTERS
But they killed Lemmiwinks!

CHRIS
Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak
when spoken to!

BUTTERS
Yes sir.

CHRIS
Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we
can to raise compassionate children.
We don't know where else to turn.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well there is an intensive seminar camp.
It's a bit severe, but it might be the
only way. M'kay?

SHARON
That sounds good to me.

LIANE
Mee too.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going
to tolerance camp.

STAN
Tolerance camp?

[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. A truck
pulls up to the entrance and two guards open the gates. Beyond,
kids mill around under the watchful eyes of other guards. A few
moments later a guard paces in front of a crowd of kids.]

CAMP WARDEN
Welcome to tolerance camp. You are
here because you would not accept people's
differences.  Because you refuse to
accept the life choices of your fellow
man. Well those days are now over. Here
you vill verk, every hour of every day
until you submit to being tolerant of
everybody. Here, intolerance... will
not be tolerated.

[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. Mr. Slave is reading
his magazine. A few moments later Mr. Garrison storms into the
room and slams the door shut]

MR. GARRISON
God-damnit!

MR. SLAVE
How'd it go?

MR. GARRISON
This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It
seems no matter what I do I can't get
fired!

MR. SLAVE
The principal didn't fire you?

MR. GARRISON
No! The parents felt so bad that their
kids didn't want to attend my class
anymore that they wanna give me the
Courageous Teacher award this Friday
at the Museum of Tolerance!

MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jesus Christ.

MR. GARRISON
I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass
and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!


MR. SLAVE
Well it sounds to me like the principal's
just hiding things from everybody. What
you need to do is let the parents see
what kind of demented faggot you are.


MR. GARRISON
Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave.
The parents have to see for themselves.
The awards ceremony! Well we'll put
on a show they'll never forget!

MR. SLAVE
Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.

SINGERS
Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far
and fast.

To find his way out of a gay man's ass.

The road ahead is filled with danger and fright

But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might.

FROG KING
Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance
of the small intestine. Now you must
seek out the Sparrow Prince.

SINGERS
The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way
up ahead.

Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.

Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late

Slow down now and seal your fate.

SPARROW PRINCE
I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my
spirit been trapped within this place.
Before you lies the maze of the small
intestine. One path leads to the stomach,
the other to certain doom. Take with
you this helmet and torch.  Let them
be your guide.

SINGERS
Take the magic helmet torch to help
you light the way.

There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.


Ahead you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.


Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win.

[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The
kids are in a large room the size of an airport hangar. All of
them have been doing arts and crafts, as they are dirty with
crayons and paint. Each column of tables is being patroled by
a guard.]

CAMP WARDEN
Today we wll be using the fingerpaint!
You vill make a painting that shows
people of different races and sexual
orientations getting along. Figerpaint.
Figerpaint!  You vill not make any distinction
between people of different colors!
People with different sexual preferences!
You vill accept everyone!  What are
you fingerpainting?!

KYLE
Uh, a bear?

CAMP WARDEN
Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do
with accepting people of different races!


KYLE
Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.


CAMP WARDEN
Start over!  You will fingerpaint what
we tell you!  GO!  Faster.  Faster!
Faasterr.

KYLE
Aaaa!

CAMP WARDEN
Faster! Are you done?! What is it?!
What have you done?!

KYLE
People of all colors and creeds holding
hands beneath a rainbow!

CAMP WARDEN
GOOD!  That wasn't so hard, was it?
NOW DO IT AGAIN!  Faster!  Faasterr!


[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. Mr. Garrison talks
to Mr. Slave. There are no kids in class, as they've all gone
to tolerance camp, apparently]

MR. GARRISON
There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The
perfect plan to get us fired. You finished
your costume design yet?

MR. SLAVE
Almost. I jast have to get through
a su-  Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.

MR. GARRISON
What's the matter?

MR. SLAVE
Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach,
I guess.

MR. GARRISON
Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't
have my teacher's ass under the weather.


MR. SLAVE
Eugh, Jesus Christ.

SINGERS
Lemmiwinks came to the stomach far.


'Neath the depths of the lungs and heart.

A CATFISH
You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks.
I am the Catatafish.

SINGERS
Catatafish of the stomach's cove.

CATATAFISH
If you answer this riddle, the esophagus
will let you pass.

SINGERS
Catatafish riddle will soom be told.


[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The
kids are now in a different room quietly making macaroni pictures
on the floor, but they are all fatigued. The guard walks up to
a soldier on a catwalk and talks with him.]

CAMP WARDEN
Everything in order?

CAMP SOLDIER
Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the
prisoners make macaroni pictures that
illustrate diversity in the verkplace.


CAMP WARDEN
Eh-xcellent!

KYLE
Oh.

STAN
Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making
your macaroni pictures.

KYLE
Can't... glue... any... more .

STAN
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue,
damn you!

CAMP WARDEN
Take this one away. He is done for.


STAN
Butters!

BUTTERS
No more... arts and crafts...

STAN
Jesus... we have to get out of here.


[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, outside.
The kids are at play. Cartman walks over to a Porto-Potty and
enters, but stops. He looks down into the toilet and finds two
girls there in the septic tank]

GIRL 1
Please don't tell them that we're hiding
here.

GIRL 2
We can't work anymore. We'll die.

CAMP SOLDIER
Vhat?  Waht?!

CARTMAN
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting
back to work.

CAMP SOLDIER
Vhat is in there?

CARTMAN
Nothing.

CAMP SOLDIER
Get back to verk.

CARTMAN
Yes sir!  Phew.

THE GIRLS
Eww! Eww! Eww!

CARTMAN
Hey, I was kidding. There's actually
two girls hiding down there. Hey!


[Museum of Tolerance, Friday night. The main hall is set up for
the awards ceremony and the guests are seated.]

TOUR GUIDE
Tonight we are here to honor an amazing
fourth grade teacher with the Courageous
Teacher award.  Herbert Garrison came
out about two years ago. Since then
he has faced adversity. He has even
faced ridicule by some of the students.


SHARON
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.


TOUR GUIDE
It is my honor to present the Courageous
Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison.


MR. GARRISON
Get along, little Slave.

RANDY
Oh my God.

KYLE'S FATHER
That's what our boys were talking about?


MR. GARRISON
Ding-ding, ding-ding.

MAN 1
He is so courageous.

MR. GARRISON
Say, Mr. Slave.

MR. SLAVE
Yes, Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
I had a dream last night that you were
a real dick.

MR. SLAVE
Really? Why would you dream that I was
being an asshole?

MR. GARRISON
No no, I was the asshole.

MAN 2
Ogh, that is so courageous.

MAN 3
What an amazing human being!

MR. GARRISON
Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this
award. Uh but you know what makes me
even happier? Sucking balls.

AUDIENCE
Ahh

MR. GARRISON
It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr.
Slave.

MR. SLAVE
I've got a little- Oof.  Ohoc, Jesus
Christ. What's happening in there?


[Inside Mr. Slave's stomach at that moment, Lemmiwinks has been
put into a gyroscope and is ready to be shot up the esophagus
and out the mouth.]

FROG KING
Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the
Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials
are nearly through!

[Outside Mr. Slave's stomach, onstage]

MR. SLAVE
Oh! I should have never shoved all those
poor animals up my ass!

MR. GARRISON
Uh...

MAN 4
Courageous.

MAN 5
So courageous.

MR. GARRISON
God-damnit, don't you people get it?!
I'm trying to get fired here!

MAN 3
Oh, that's courageous.

MR. GARRISON
Look, this kind of behavior should not
be acceptable from a teacher!

MR. SLAVE
Yeah, Jesus Christ.

MAN 6
But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant


MAN 3
Yes. The mu-se-um.

MAN 7
The mu-se-um tells us.

MR. GARRISON
Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just
because you have to tolerate something
doesn't mean you have to approve of
it! If you had to like it, it'd be called
the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate"
means you're just putting up with it!
You tolerate a crying child sitting
next to you on the airplane or, or you
tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss
you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!


RANDY
He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals,
they just hated the way this asshole
was acting.

KYLE'S FATHER
We'ge gotta get our boys back!

MR. GARRISON
Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get
fired and get my 25 million dollars?!


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No, no, I think I have a better idea.


[Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, Saturday, day. The boys' parents
are at the front gate. Black-and-white fades into color, and
Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters are present. They are quite thin,
clearly undernourished, and their clothes fit loose on them]


RANDY
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell
us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?


KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes. You boys don't know how much we
suffered.

CHRIS
Come on, let's go.

MR. GARRISON
Well this is insane!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious
you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.


CAMP WARDEN
Vhat do we have here? Noo recruits?
I assure you, the next veek will be
nothing but pain and suffering!

MR. SLAVE
Oooo, this could be kind of fun.

SINGERS
Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale
is nearly through

CATATAFISH
Great job, Lemmiwinks.

SPARROW PRINCE
Thanks to you we are all free.

FROG KING
But your adventures are just beginning,
for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks.
You are the Gerbil King.

THE THREE SPIRITS
All hail the Gerbil King.

"4TH GRADE"


Written by


Trey Parker





STAN
Well, here we are, dude, the first day
of fourth grade.

KYLE
Yeah. No more getting pushed around
by fourth graders!

5TH-GRADER IN MIDDLE
Get out of my way, you little dorks!


KYLE
Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!


5TH-GRADER IN MIDDLE
Yeah, but now, we're fifth-graders,
you stupid fourth-graders, so move it!


KYLE
Ungh, gay, dude.

STAN
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders
to beat up.  Hey, come here

YOUNGER BOY
What?

STAN
What grade are you going into?

YOUNGER BOY
Thi-ird

STAN
Stupid third grader!

CARTMAN
Yeah,  get out of here!

YOUNGER BOY
Uhuhuhow.

CARTMAN
There, that's better.

KYLE
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher
is some new lady from Denver.

STAN
Denver?

CARTMAN
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over
her.

KYLE
He's right. We have to take a hard stance
right now and establish that we're the
dominant ones in this relationship!


STAN
Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!
We need to stand up to this new teacher
and insert ourselves! Let's all do something
radical!

CLYDE
Like what?

STAN
Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we
all jump up on our desks and pull down
our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
all together!

THE KIDS
YEAH!!!

CARTMAN
Why, that's PERfect!

BUTTERS
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants
down,  should we stand frontways or
back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds,
or-ar our w-wieners?

STAN
...I think showing her our asses should
be quite sufficient, Butters.

BUTTERS
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this
, with our wieners pokin' through the
back of our legs, you know, and give
'er a nice fruit bowl.

KYLE
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.


STAN
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock
hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks,
pull down our pants and yell, "KISS
MY ASS!!!"

KYLE
Together we are strong!

THE KIDS
YEAH!!!

CLYDE
Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling
his pants down.

STAN
We got you covered, Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmay!

[The bell rings again, and the kids enter their new classroom
a bit awed at the surroundings. Lab sinks and equipment line
the walls. New, modern desks greet them. An aquarium and some
modern art are also present.]

KYLE
Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?


BUTTERS
Huhuh, look at all this stuff.

CARTMAN
Hey, what the hell is with these little
half-desks?

STAN
Dude, look at the walls.  Everythng
is written in some strange, foreign
language.

NEW TEACHER
Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome
to the fourth grade.

KYLE
Holy God, dude!

KENNY
(Those tittes are fuckin' huge!)

NEW TEACHER
My name is Ms. Choksondik.

STAN
...More like, Ms. Makesmesick.

KYLE
Yeah!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Play time is over, children! Do you
understand me?!  I don't know how your
last teacher behaved, but this is the
fourth grade!  And it is time to go
to work!

CARTMAN
KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys.
Seriously weak.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, young man, I hope you have a
good explanation for this.

CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sure I do.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
This is the fourth grade! You need to
grow up!

CARTMAN
I'm trying.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, get back to your desk and write
a thousand-word essay on why you feel
you need to disrupt my class.

CARTMAN
Fantastic, then.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, let us begin our first-day exam.
SILENCE!

[South Park Elementary, outside. The bell rings, and the students
head out onto the playground.]

STAN
What a bitch!

KYLE
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't
even tell what she's looking at.

CARTMAN
You guys are all such pussies!

TWEEK
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive??
Fractions?? I can't do i-it!

STAN
This is it. The end of innocence.  This
is the loss of that playful youth all
our parents told us about.

KYLE
I just didnt think it would come so
soon.

CARTMAN
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much
we all took the third grade for granted.


KYLE
Huh?

CARTMAN
Everything was great in third grade.
And now that it's all over, we'er starting
to see just how special it was.

[wistfully]

Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?

We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade


[a classroom scene, then a playground scene as heads of Cartman
and Kenny float by]

We learned wonderous things from a teacher so nice

[Mr. Grrison is dessed as a pirate before a happy class]

Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles

[Their desks turn into marshmallow seats and float up as the
classroom fades into sky. A teddy-bear face floats by]

The world seemed to all make sense

but that sense seems to slowly fade

[They float towards a rainbow and sun, and the scene fades to
black, then to the playground]

After Third Grade


In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons

[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land]

We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue

[Cartman makes a glitter picture of a cow's face]

We had warm cookies and hearts full of love

[Kenny makes one of a clown holding a bloody knife in one hand
and a boy's bloody head in the other]

And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...

[Cartman sings to the audience and points]

There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to
go back for one minute

[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land, then gives
each kid a happy spanking in a room full of huge gift props.
The scene fades to the playground again]

To Third Grade

[A moment of silence, and Clyde starts to cry. Butters draws
near and consoles him]

KYLE
Wow! I had already forgotten how great
third grade was.

BUTERS
Huh-it sure was.

CARTMAN
I wish I was sstill there.

STAN
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to
third grade!

KYLE
How?

STAN
We travel back in time.

KYLE
Oh yeah, time travel.

BUTTERS
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does
it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it
hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.


STAN
It can't be that bad. People do it on
TV all the time.

CARTMAN
Yeah, we just have to find somebody
who knows how to do it.

KYLE
Well, what about those two college guys
next door to me? They're always doing
science experiments in their basement.


CARTMAN
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back
in time, those two dorks will know how!


[The basement of the two college guys, after school. These are
computer geeks, with at least three computers in there. The blond
guy works on his nose as he talks.]

NERD #1
When it comes to time-traveling theory,
there are basically two school of thought.
The Spock Theory is that a sling shot
around the sun could create a wormhole
in which time could not escape. The
Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however,
is that a nag vibration could create
a rip in the time-space continuum-


CARTMAN
Look, whatever it takes, we just have
to get back to third grade.

NERD #2
Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four
times the Enterprise went back in time,
and four times they almost didn't make
it back.

STAN
We don't want to make it back, we want
to stay there.

NERD #1
Oh.

KYLE
So can you do it?

NERD #2
It's all theoretical, but from a scientific
standpoint, the creation of a rip in
space-time is possible. We just need
to find an inertia device.

NERD #1
Heeeyyy.  This kid's electric wheelchair
might be just what we need.

TIMMY
Tuh-timmih?

[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Principal Victoria
and Mr. Mackey are talking to Chef.]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is
driving me nuts!

CHEF
What's the problem?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has
very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't
seem to like wearing a bra.

CHEF
You call that a problem? That sounds
like heaven to me.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
No, it's really not as nice as you might
imagine, Chef, m'kay.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Principal Victoria, I would like a word!


CHEF
Oooo! Call the doctor!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
My new students are the most misbehaved,
illiterate, brain-dead group of children
I have ever come across!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, Ms.... Choksondik, those children
did fairly well in the third grade.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
One of them is mentally handicapped,
for Christ's sake!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh? Which one?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would
like to have a talk with their last
year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh,
Garrison?!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's
seen Mr. Garrison since the last school
year ended.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Why?! Where did he go?!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
We... don't like to talk about it.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
But I need help reaching these kids!
I have nothing but the hghest expectations
for them. And with  God as my witness-


THE ADULTS
Aww Oooo

MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm going to teach these kids the wonders
of the world, so that they can reach
the top!  I hope that sometime very
soon you will let me in on what happened
to this Mr. Garrison! And with that
I will bid you good day!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then.


[South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's classroom, next day.
The kids are all in their seats wearing goggles and the two nerds
are with them]

NERD #1
Alright, when we power up, the handicapped
kid's chair will accelerate at a high
rate of speed about 10 feet that way
, then make the required magnetic vibrations.


NERD #2
If the fields are right, it should then
create a wormhole up near the front
of the classroom.

WENDY
You guys don't actually think this is
going to work, do you?

NERD #1
Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole,
yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2
seconds to run through it.

NERD #2
And on the other side you will find
yourself in the exact same spot, only
one year ago.

STAN
Back in the third grade.

KIDS
Cool/Wow.

KYLE
I can't wait until the teacher yells
at us this time, and we all tell her
to suck our balls!

KIDS
Yeah!

STAN
Oh! Here she comes.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, I hope you all did
your homework last night. Please pass
your papers up to the frontuh.

CARTMAN
Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you
guys, I am so seriously-

MS. CHOKSONDIK
I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!


CARTMAN
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick!
We didn't feel like it!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
It's Choksondik! And you are all going
to have detention!

CARTMAN
Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm
afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen?


NERD #1
Primary fusion initiated

NERD #2
Molecular grenadine active.

TIMMY
Aa-aa-ah!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
What are you doing?!

CARTMAN
We're going back in time to third grade!
Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see
you in another year! Hahaaa!

TIMMY
Timmaaaaaaaaah!  Timmaaaaaaaaah!

NERD #1
I didn't think it would work.

NERD #2
Me neither.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has
some explaining to do!

CARTMAN
You're damn right they do!

KYLE
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all
that stuff! We've gotta help him!


STAN
Yeah!

KYLE
Come on!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Children! Children, come back here!


[South Park, the streets. Timmy is rolling down the street being
passed by honking cars going this way and that. Timmy screams
a frightened scream]

STAN
Timmy, you have to stop!

NERD #1
No!

STAN
No??

NERD #1
Look, the system malfunctions if he
stops. The nuclear core can bake his
magnetic field and the whole chair will
blow sky-high.

KYLE
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off
that chair!

NERD #1
No!

KYLE
No??

NERD #2
We've rigged the chair to be sensitive
to his weight. If he gets off, the whole
thing blows!

STAN
So if Timmy drops his speed below five
miles an hour the chair blow, and if
he gets off, the chair blows?

THE NERDS
Yup.

STAN
My God!

NEWS 4 LIVE UPDATE

ANCHOR TOM
It's been over three hours since the
police first showed up on the scene
of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set
with explosives.

[South Park, Tele's. The boys and the nerds rush to the video
window to watch the report]

STAN
Over here, over here!

ANCHOR TOM
The child can't stop or get off the
chair without risking explosion, and
so the SWAT team will now attempt to
disarm the device.

[South Park, a street. Timmy reaches an open stretch of road]


TIMMY
Timmi-hih-ih!

SWAT HANSEN
Closer!  Don't worry, son. Just watch
your speed and stay still!

PILOT
Look out, Hansen!

SWAT RESCUER HANSEN
Oh!

BRUNETTE
Aaaah!

TIMMY
Timmaaay!

HANSEN
Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!

BRUNETTE
Oh my God, what's going on?

HANSEN
Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair
is set to explode!

BRUNETTE
What?!  AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!

HANSEN
It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the
speed above 5!

BRUNETTE
O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.

TIMMY
Tih-Timmah?

BRUNETTE
Okay. I kept the speed at 5.

HANSEN
Good! What's the wheelchair's battery
power at?

19
46 ... 19:45 ...

BRUNETTE
Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!

[South Park, Tele's. The boys react to the news]

STAN
Less than 20 minutes?!

KYLE
Oh no! What have we done?!

[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Principal Victoria
holds up an oversize bra for Chef's and Mr. Mackey's appraisal]


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Whattaya think? Too forward?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
I HAVE HAD IT!!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Waaah!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
These children are out of control! I
must speak with their last year's teacher,
Mr. Garrison!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
As we said before, that's impossible.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
What in God's name happened to him?


CHEF
Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had
several uuh, eee-motional issues. He
was a closet homosexual who hated gay
people. Whenever someone asked him if
he was gay, he'd go nuts.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
And then he was accused of trying to
solicit sex from a young boy.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
After being dismissed from teaching,
he went off to write romance novels.
His first novel sold well and everything
was fine until he found out that his
novel won the gay Pulitzer prize, and
was considered the best homoerotic novel
since Huckleberry Finn.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
He finaly snapped and had a nervous
breakdown and... went up into the mountains
to live in solitude.

CHEF
Some say that on cold nights you can
still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay!
I'm not gaaay!"

MR. GARRISON
Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
And, nobody has found him?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well, we really haven't ll-looked.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
I see.  Then the only way I'll find
the secret to teaching these kids is
to go up into those mountains and find
Mr. Garrison myself!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
But he could be anywhere up high in
those mountains.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to
climb up  and up  and up!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
What?

[South Park, a street. Timmy and the brunette are still on the
open stretch of road]

BRUNETTE
Oh my God, Oh my God!

[South Park, a street. A field reporter is on the scene]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside
of Denver where the darling handicapped
boy fights for his life on a wheelchair
of death.  Guys, can you tell us what
kind of explosive we're actually dealing
with here.

NERD #1
Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion
core with a veltig reactant-

TIMMY
Ah, please help!

NERD #2
Which just turned into a time bomb.


TIMMY
Please help.

NERD #1
This has never happened in all the 72
original Star Trek episodes.

NERD #2
Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes.

NERD #1
...No, there were 72.

NERD #2
No there weren't!

NERD #1
Oh, you are such a nerd!

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers
are gonna try and send in one of the
handicapped boy's little friends, in
an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully,
disarm the device.

[South Park, a street. A SWAT truck full of rescuers passes Timmy
and the brunette and slows down to wheelchair speed. Kenny is
with them]

HANSEN
It's alright, eveything's goin' tuh
be fine.

BRUNETTE
Oh my God!

HANSEN
Alright, young man, when you get underneath
that wheelchair, I want you to relay
back to me with this walky-talky, and
then I'll tell you which wires to cross.
Ready?

KENNY
(Yes, sir!)

HANSEN
Go below!

KENNY
(Hi guys.)  (Uh oh.)  (Uff. I'm okay.)
(I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!)

STAN
Well, who didn't see that coming?

BRUNETTE
Oh my God! Oh my God!

HANSEN
Stay calm! You have to stay calm!


BRUNETTE
But if we got off the chair it blows
up!

HANSEN
No no, that's only if the boy gets off.


BRUNETTE
Oh.  See ya!

TIMMY
Timmih!

PILOT
Ten seconds, Hansen!

STAN
...nine, eight...

TIMMY
Please-a help me.

PILOT
...six, five...

TIMMY
Please help me. Please help me.

HANSEN
Got it! I think! Up, up!

TIMMY
Timmay!

NERD #1
Hey, it did work.

[South Park, a tall mountain not unlike the Matterhorn, next
day. Ms. Choksondik scales it, and reaches a plateau. Several
cats follow her up. She sees a cave and approaches it, then enters]


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Hello-oo-ooo.  Oh, what am I doing?
I'm gonna get myself killed.  Is anyone
here?  Mister? Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
Who-? Who are you? What do you want?


MS. CHOKSONDIK
I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've
come to... seek your help.  Please. I
don't know how to handle the new fourth
graders. I've tried everything. I need
to know how you taught them.

MR. GARRISON
No! No, I... haven't... taught in over...
eight... months.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach
these kids! You're my only hope!

MR. GARRISON
Do you know what it is to be a teacher,
Ms....?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Choksondik.

MR. GARRISON
No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's
what you get for bein' a teacher! You
work and you work for the children and
then people start rumors that you're
gay even though you love poontang!


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Mr. Garrison, these children are depeding
on me to give them a future. I can't
do it without your guidance. Please!
Help me, for them! For the future of
our children!

MR. GARRISON
...Two hundred bucks.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
...Done.

[The basement of the two college guys, after school. The boys
show up again. Much of the stuff that was in the baasement is
gone. Soon, it is shown that the second nerd has moved out]


STAN
Dude! You gotta build us another time
machine!

NERD #1
Huh? Oh... Can't.

KYLE
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made
it work; just build us another one!


NERD #1
I can't, because pizza-face isn't here!
We're not on speaking terms! We got
in a big fight and he moved all his
stuff out!

STAN
W-what did you get in a fight about?


NERD #1
There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps
saying there's 72!

STAN
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding
me!

NERD #1
No! He actually thinks there's 72.!


CARTMAN
Look, dude, can't you just build us
another machine without him?

NERD #1
No. Pizza-face took all his equipment
home to his mom's. Now, if you can go
over there and get him to admit that
he's wrong...

STAN
Alright, come on, guys.  Man, I can't
bellieve we have to do this while Timmy's
already back in time!

KYLE
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third
grade right now living it up!

[A tropical forest. Dinosaurs roam this land. A pteranodon flies
overhead as a triceratops chases Timmy]

TIMMY
Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!

[South Park, the "Matterhorn," the plateau outside Garrison's
cave. Mr. Garrison walks around Ms. Choksondik as she balances
three books on each hand and one on her head while standing on
only her left foot.]

MR. GARRISON
Alright, let's try it again.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
"Children, we are now going to do math
problems."

MR. GARRISON
"But teacher, I don't want to do my
math problems."

MS. CHOKSONDIK
"Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll
be in very big trouble!"

MR. GARRISON
"Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher!
You can just suck my balls!"

MS. CHOKSONDIK
"Don't use that kind of language, young
man!"

MR. GARRISON
NOOO!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
No??

MR. GARRISON
Look, you can't counter a profane command
with an idle threat! You must extingish
it with a vulgar suggestion! When a
child says, "Suck my balls," you say,
"Present them."

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh.

MR. GARRISON
Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Pre-sent them?

MR. GARRISON
Good.  Very good.  You're ready to
move on to the next level. But I warn
you: we will now be diving deep into
your own psyche. These children know
what scares you, and so we, too, must
face those demons.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm ready. I'm not afraid.

MR. GARRISON
You will be! You will be!  You wil
be.

STAN
God-damnit, this is ridiculous.

NERD #2
What?!

STAN
Dude, can you please just stop fighting
with your friend and build another machine
so we can travel back in time to the
third grade?

NERD #2
Look! There aern't 73 episodes of Star
Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie"
was a 2-parter that counts as one episode!
Pizza-face is wrong!

CARTMAN
Who the hell cares?!

NERD #2
I know! Why does he have to be such
a dick about it?!

KYLE
Wouldn't it be better to just agree
with him and forget the whole thing?


NERD #2
No, because he's WRONG!

KYLE
Look. You guys built a machine together
that can bend time. If you'll just agree
with him, you can build another one
and usher in a whole new era of science!


NERD #2
And live in a world of 72 original Star
Treks? I don't think so! I don't want
to live in that world.

CARTMAN
God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!


STAN
I know.

BUTTERS
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that
"The Menagerie" originally was the pilot
and later got split up into two episodes,
eh ha ha. Ha ha.  Hahahaha, eh the,
eh the dumbasses.

STAN
Wiait a minute! I've got it.

NERD #2
What?!

STAN
Dude, if you guys build another time
machine, you can travel back in time
and ask the creator of Star Trek how
many episodes there were!

NERD #2
Dude, Jesus, you're right.

[South Park, the "Matterhorn." Mr. Garrison takes Ms. Choksondik
to a gnarled, giant willow tree on a mountainside forest]

MR. GARRISON
This is it: The Tree of Insight. You
must go in and face what lives inside.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
What lives inside?

MR. GARRISON
Hel if I know. I wouldn't go in there.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh, alrighty.  What the? Why there's
nothng in here but an exit to the other
side!  There's nothing in here at all.
...Oh, and I actually thought my mental
demons would be in here.  Wait a minute.
Maybe there's not supposed to be anythng
in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that
I alone do have the strength to reach
the kids!  I think I get it now!


MR. GARRISON
Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're
taking too long in the damn Tree of
Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where
the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa!
Who? Who are you?

CLEAN GARRISON
I am you.  I am your gay side.

UNKEMPT GARRISON
My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY
SIDE!!!

CLEAN GARRISON
You must face me at last.

[South Park, the "Matterhorn," moments later...]

UNKEMPT GARRISON
You aren't real! You can't be!

CLEAN GARRISON
It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay
self, incarnate.

UNKEMPT GARRISON
What do you want?

CLEAN GARRISON
I want you to not fight me anymore.
To accept me, once and for all.

UNKEMPT GARRISON
Why?

CLEAN GARRISON
Don't you see?  All these years, your
pain, your confusion, it comes from
one place. Your denial of who you are.
Of who... we are.

UNKEMPT GARRISON
But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks
I am!

CLEAN GARRISON
Oh, stop it! What about the time you
looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in
the men's locker room?!

UNKEMPT GARRISON
I was just comparing size!

CLEAN GARRISON
For seven minutes?!

UNKEMPT GARRISON
Aaa!

CLEAN GARRISON
And what about the time you masturbated
to the men's 100-meter swimming relay
at the Olympics?!

UNKEMPT GARRISON
I was beating off to the chicks!

CLEAN GARRISON
THERE WERE NO CHICKS!

UNKEMPT GARRISON
OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!


CLEAN GARRISON
ADMIT IT!

UNKEMPT GARRISON
NO!!!

CLEAN GARRISON
YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND
GET A G-

UNKEMPT GARRISON
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!!
I'm...gay. I'm gay!  I am gay! You hear
that everyone?  I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm
gay and it...  and it feels good.

[South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's classroom, a few days
later. Where the chalkboard used to be are just some boards hastily
put up, along with a DO NOT CROSS line and three safety cones
to guard this makeshift board.]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, I hope you all did
your-  Oowhat is going on now?!

CARTMAN
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back
in time to third grade!-God-damnit you
guys, you seriously said this time you'd
snap into it with me.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Oh Good Gravy, not this again.

CARTMAN
Yes! We've had a new time maching built:
this one out of a simple microwave oven
and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perheps
we shall see you in the past, hahaa.
Gentlemen?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Children, I will have order!!

NERD #1
I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to
tell you how WRONG you are! Just like
when you said there were no two-parters
of Battlestar Galactica!

NERD #2
There WEREN'T!

NERD #1
The episode called "Gonzo on Ice Planet
Zero" was a two-parter.

NERD #2
No it WASN'T!

STAN
Oh, son of a bitch!

NERD #1
I'll kill you!

CARTMAN
There it is! Come on, everybody!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Children, get back into your seats!


CARTMAN
No way, lady!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, I mean it!

CARTMAN
You can suck my balls!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Present them.

CARTMAN
...What?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
You said, "suck my balls." Well, go
ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.


STAN
Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've
said.

CARTMAN
Touché, teacher. Touché.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now, children, listen to me. Why do
you want to go back in time? Life isn't
about going back, it's about going forward.
Yes, there are times in our life that
we wish we could relive, but, if we
already lived them perfectly, why live
them again? The adventure of life is
that there's always something new. New
challenges, new experiences. A fun game
is a game that gets harder as it goes.
So it is with life. Do you understand?


STAN
Dude. Sh-she's right.

KYLE
Yeah. And you know, now that I think
about it, third grade wasn't all that
great, either.

STAN
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why
the hell did you try to make us think
third grad was so great?!

KYLE
Yeah! You suck, Cartman!

CARTMAN
What??

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, students, that will be quite
enough! If you're ready, let's continue
on... with the fourth grade.

TIMMY
AAAAAAA!

KYLE
Hey, Timmy's back!

STAN
Dude, it looks like he's been all over
time! He must have such cool stuff to
tell us.

TIMMY
Eh, Timmih.

[South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Chef talks with Mr.
Mackey and Principal Victoria]

CHEF
You know I'm always here to help, Principal
Victoria.

MR. GARRISON
Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!!


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
What?

MR. GARRISON
I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You admit it? You admit it!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've
finally come to terms with yourself!


MR. GARRISON
Yeah, it feels really good!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, congratulations!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yeah, congratulations!

MR. GARRISON
You know, I, I feel like I can start
anew. If it's alright with you, I'd
like to go back to teaching the third
grade!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people.

Trey Parker, Philip Stark, and Matt Stone



ACT I

EXT. ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG - DAY

The children are all gathered around a small Archaeological
dig site. A plain looking Anthropologist talks to the boys
and girls.

ANTHROPOLOGIST
And so, these ancient arrowheads are
buried deep down in the Earth's crust!
We dig 'em up, polish 'em off and
find over twelve new arrowheads every
month!

CARTMAN
Booorrrring.

The kids all laugh.

MR. GARRISON
Eric, keep quiet! I'm trying to sleep!

Garrison is lying on rock with a newspaper over his face.

ANTHROPOLOGIST
Now, can anybody tell me WHO left
these arrowheads here?

STAN
(Hand raised)
Isn't that YOUR job?

ANTHROPOLOGIST
Well, yes, but I want to see if you're
learning anything.

STAN
(This is new)
Oh.

ANTHROPOLOGIST
Okay, I tell you what, why don't we
all grab our little anthropology pic
axes that were handed out, and we'll
dig for our very own Indian
Arrowheads!!

The kids all cheer and start digging.

As Cartman swings his pic axe, he immediately starts to sing.

CARTMAN
(Singing)
Day is never finished
Masa got me working
Some day masa set me free...

STAN
Dude, shut up, Cartman!

PIP
OOH! OOH! I think I found one!!

But Cartman has hold of the other end.

CARTMAN
No, I found it!

Cartman and Pip hold the large arrowhead by opposite ends.

PIP
Oh, I do believe I found it first.

CARTMAN
No, I did, Pip!!

PIP
Oh, dear...

CARTMAN
Well, guess we'll have to Roshambo
for it.

PIP
What do you mean?

CARTMAN
Well, first I kick you in the nuts
as hard as I can. Then you kick ME
in the nuts as hard as YOU can. And
we keep going back and forth until
somebody falls. Last one standing
gets the arrowhead.

PIP
Oh, my. Well, I suppose if I must...

CARTMAN
Okay, ready? I'll go first.

Cartman takes a step and hauls off, kicking Pip square in
the balls. Pip immediately turns blue and falls to the ground
coughing.

Cartman looks pleased.

After Pip stops coughing, he finally manages to speak.

PIP
Well, I guess you win.

CARTMAN
Oh, I don't care, you can have the
stupid arrowhead. I don't want it.

Cartman tosses the arrowhead down to Pip, who is still lying
painfully in the dirt.

The kids all go back to digging.

CARTMAN
Day is never finished
Masa got me working... Oh, look I
found another one!

Cartman cleans off the dirt, and sees that he is actually
holding a large, stone triangle with ancient symbols and
writing on it.

CARTMAN
Aw, this is just a stupid triangle!

Cartman tosses the triangle over his shoulder. It hits the
ground and Kyle picks it up.

KYLE
Woa, check it out, dude. It's got
little drawings on it.

Kyle holds up the large, stone triangle revealing that it
does have a strange symbol on it.

STAN
What's is it?

KYLE
I don't know.

Suddenly, the triangle lets out a small yellow glow.

STAN
Woa!

KYLE
That was cool!

CARTMAN
Hey, give me that back!

KYLE
You threw it away, Cartman! It's
MINE now!

CARTMAN
We'll Roshambo for it.

KYLE
No way, fatty! It's mine!!

CARTMAN
Anthropologist!!!!!!

The Anthropologist walks over.

ANTHROPOLOGIST
How's it going, boys?

CARTMAN
I found a magic triangle and this
greedy son of a bitch took it from
me!!

KYLE
You threw it away, fatso!!

ANTHROPOLOGIST
Let me see that.

Kyle gives him the triangle.

ANTHROPOLOGIST
Why, this is Anastasi writing! My
God, this must must be thousands of
years old!!

CARTMAN
Come on! Let me kick you in the nuts
for it!!

INT. TELEVISION SET - NEWS STUDIO

ANCHOR
And finally tonight, a young boy
from South Park, Colorado found
something very interesting during a
field trip today. Here with a special
report is a quadriplegic Swiss man
on a pony.

EXT. ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG - DAY

A Quadriplegic Swiss man sits on a pony with another person
holding a mic in front of his face.

QUADRIPLEGIC FIREMAN ON PONY
Thanks Tom, the little eight year
old was very shocked indeed when he
came across a very ancient triangular
object.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP on Kyle with a mic in his face.

KYLE
Well, I was just digging around and
I was all like 'Dude, I found this
triangle'. And my friends were all
like, 'dude'. And I was all 'Dude'.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP on Cartman with the mic on him.

CARTMAN
And I told him I said Kyle, I will
kick you in the nuts. But he didn't
give it back to me. So I kicked him
square in the nuts... And he cried
like Nancy Kerrigan.

KYLE (O.S.)
YOU LIAR, CARTMAN!!!

CARTMAN
Screw you, triangle thief!!

QUADRIPLEGIC FIREMAN ON PONY
And so the little boy will take his
discovery home, and perhaps donate
it to science... A little later.
Back to you, Dave.

INT. TELEVISION SET - NEWS STUDIO

Back in the studio, the guy is at his desk, with a live image
of the reporter behind him.

ANCHOR
Thanks, Tom. Those are some cute,
cute kids. Except for that last one,
he's a little tubby.

The image WHIPS to Cartman.

CARTMAN
HEY!!

EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

Establishing.

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

The boys walk into Kyle's house.

STAN
What are you gonna do with it, dude?

KYLE
I'm gonna put it in my room, where
Cartman can't find it!!

CARTMAN
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!!

Kyle goes into his room and slams the door. Cartman tries
the knob, but the door is locked.

CARTMAN
Goddammit! Give my triangle! Kyle!
Seriously!

STAN
You DID throw it away, Cartman.

CARTMAN
I was just setting it aside.

STAN
Well, you might as well let it go.

CARTMAN
Never! I'll get that triangle if
it's the last thing I do!!

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

Chef is in the kitchen, stirring up a large bowl of something
indistinguishable.

CHEF
(Rap/Singing)
Gimme a little bit of that pepper.
Gimme a little bit of that salt. Put
it in the skillet and cook it-

VOICE
Excuse me, sir...

Chef turns around to see a plain looking man with a beard.

CHEF
Can I help -- Hey, you're that movie
critic guy on TV!

LEONARD MALTIN
Leonard Maltin, yes.

CHEF
Well I'll be a teenage girl backstage
at an Aerosmith concert! Leonard
Maltin in MY cafeteria! I'm Chef.

LEONARD MALTIN
I know who you are. You must listen
to me, Chef. We have precious little
time. Have you seen Barbara Streisand
recently?

CHEF
Barbara Streisand? You mean like,
THE Barbara Streisand?

LEONARD MALTIN
(Snapping)
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?!?!

CHEF
No! Not since Yentl!

LEONARD MALTIN
Thank God, then I'm not too late.

CHEF
Too late for what?

Leonard steps closer to Chef.

LEONARD MALTIN
Chef, it is of the utmost importance
that you tell me where those little
boys from the news report on TV are.

Chef thinks.

CHEF
Why do you care?

EXT. BUSSTOP - DAY

The boys are building a snowman.

STAN
I have a button we can use for his
nose!

KENNY
Mph mm mrph mrph mm mph.

KYLE
What would you use a marble sack
for?

CARTMAN
Be careful where you put that carrot.
Kyle might steal it.

KYLE
I didn't STEAL anything.

CARTMAN
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm
not speaking with him.

KYLE
GOOD!!

A loud CHOPPING sound surprises the boys. They look around.

CARTMAN
What's that noise?

Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, a very large, black helicopter
drops down from the sky.

STAN
Woa!

CARTMAN
AAGH!! ALIENS!!

The helicopter lands, and a figure steps out from inside.
She walks into the light, it is Barbara Streisand.

MS. STREISAND
Who is the boy I saw on the News
report tonight?

The other boys all point at Kyle.

MS. STREISAND
Hello there, little boy. Do you know
who I am?

KYLE
No.

Babs looks shocked.

MS. STREISAND
Oh I bet you do-
(Singing)
I'm going... Where there's lucky
clovers in the sun...

KYLE
(Covering his ears)
AGH! Stop that!

STAN
Yeah, that sucks, dude.

Now Babs looks pissed off.

MS. STREISAND
I'm Barbara Streisand!

STAN
So.

MS. STREISAND
So?!
(Composing herself)
So... I'm a VERY famous and VERY
important individual.

STAN
Like John Elway important?

MS. STREISAND
WHAT?!

STAN
Do you know John Elway?

MS. STREISAND
No!

STAN
(To the boys)
Oh, so you're really famous and
important but you don't know John
Elway.

Babs looks ready to kill. But she takes a deep breath and
tries another approach.

MS. STREISAND
Look, little boy, I understand that
you found a neat little triangle
near here. You know what I'm talking
about?

KYLE
(Suspicious)
Yeah...

CARTMAN
No, I found it, HE stole it!

KYLE
YOU THREW IT AWAY, CARTMAN!!!

CARTMAN
(To Streisand)
I'm not talking to him, because he's
a dirty thief.

Babs ignores this and kneels down next to Kyle.

MS. STREISAND
(Excited)
Little boy, does the triangle have a
symbol of two snakes joined at the
middle?

KYLE
Yeah, how'd you know?

Bab's eyes get huge. She takes in a deep breath, and looks
into Kyle's eyes.

MS. STREISAND
Okay, now this is VERY important...
Where is the Triangle of Zinthar
now?

KYLE
Triangle of Zinthar?

STAN
Why do you want to know, lady?

MS. STREISAND
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU, YOU PISSANT
LITTLE HICK!!!

STAN
Woa, dude!

Stan reels back. Babs grabs Kyle's arms and shakes him.

MS. STREISAND
WHERE IS THE TRIANGLE, DAMMIT?

KYLE
AGHAGH!!

Just then Officer Barbrady steps up.

OFFICER BARBRADY
What seems to be the problemo, here?

Babs let's go of Kyle, stands up and fixes her hair.

MS. STREISAND
Problemo? There's no problemo,
Officer. I was just introducing myself
to these... CHARMING little boys.

CARTMAN
Nu-uh! She was being a total bitch!

Babs gets pissed again, but contains herself.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Boys shouldn't you be in school?

STAN
It's Saturday.

OFFICER BARBRADY
NO EXCUSES! MOVE ALONG YA LITTLE
TROUBLE MAKERS!!

The boys all look at each other and walk away. Babs and
Barbrady are left alone.

MS. STREISAND
Well?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well what?

MS. STREISAND
YOU know who I am, don't you?

Barbrady looks her up and down.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, you ain't Fiona Apple. And if
you ain't Fiona Apple I don't give a
rat's ass.

MS. STREISAND
AAAGHGH!!!!!

Streisand fumes and walks away.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hoo! What a bitch!

EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE

Chef knocks on Kyle's door with Leonard Maltin.

CHEF
I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.

LEONARD MALTIN
Damn! Then we must look for them
elsewhere!

CHEF
Now, come on, man! What is this all
about?!

LEONARD MALTIN
If Barbara Streisand saw the same
news report I did, then those boys
are in grave danger... If YOU were
Barbara Streisand, where would you
be right now?

Chef thinks...

CHEF
Hmmm...

EXT. TOM'S RHINOPLASTY - DAY

Establishing.

EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE

LEONARD MALTIN
No, no! I mean where would she be
staying?

CHEF
Oh... Uh, well, I always heard that
Mrs. Streisand had her own four
million dollar condominium up near
the ski slope.

LEONARD MALTIN
Where?!

CHEF
I don't know, it was just a rumor!

LEONARD MALTIN
Dammit, man, where is your car?!?!

EXT. BARBARA STREISAND'S 4 MILLION DOLLAR MOUNTAIN CONDO

A huge, all glass immaculate condo sits perched on a mountain
above South Park.

A TITLE reads 'Barbara Streisand's Four Million Dollar
Mountain Condo'.

INT. BARBARA STREISAND'S 4 MILLION DOLLAR MOUNTAIN CONDO

Babs stands on her balcony overlooking the town and tapping
her fingers much like the Grinch.

MS. STREISAND
He has it Milo... That little bastard
has the triangle.

MILO
Are you sure?

MS. STREISAND
I'm sure! He knew about the symbol
of Krulock!!

Bab's walks into the living room. Milo follows her.

MILO
Then why don't we go get it?

MS. STREISAND
A cop showed up. He's a clever one.
I can't blow everything now that I'm
this close. Everything must be handled
very carefully.

Now babs walks over to a bookcase and hits a button on it.
Immediately, the bookcase spins around and a huge, hidden
glass case reveals itself.

MS. STREISAND
How many years has it been, Milo?
Thirty? Forty?

Streisand walks up to the case and peers in.

MS. STREISAND
For so long I have waited to find
the other triangle...

We ZOOM in on the glass case.

Inside, in a very strange display, is a small, blue triangle.
An empty space next to it, awaits another triangle... Kyle's
Triangle.

MS. STREISAND
And now I am so close... The dawn of
Zinthar is close at hand!!!!

Babs starts a horrible, maniacal laugh.

FIRST COMMERCIAL BREAK

ACT II

EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Establishing.

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE

The inside of Kyle's house is lit softly by moonlight.

PAN ACROSS Kyle's room.

Kyle is sleeping soundly in his bed.

PAN ACROSS further, where we see the triangle displayed
proudly on Kyle's dresser.

A STRANGE SOUND cues the camera to TILT UP to the ceiling,
where a circle is being cut by a blue flame.

The circle completes, and the piece of ceiling falls to the
floor.

Kyle turns a little, but stays asleep.

Now a rope falls from the ceiling, and a figure, dressed all
in black, slides down it.

We see through the masked eyes of this person. It looks over
at Kyle, who tosses and turns, then back to the triangle. It
nears the triangle, reaches its black gloved hand towards
it...

IKE
BABA MAMA BABA MA!!!!

The figure is startled, and knocks over a glass framed picture
on Kyle's dresser. It hits the ground. SMASH!!!!! Kyle jolts
awake. Ike jumps in front of the figure.

KYLE
Cartman?!

Cartman takes off his black mask.

CARTMAN
You scared the crap out of me, Ike!

KYLE
What the hell are you doing?!

CARTMAN
I'm trying to get my triangle --
Wait a minute, I'm not talking to
you!

Cartman turns to Ike.

CARTMAN
Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was
just trying to get MY triangle back?!!

IKE
Baba simi babangle ba.

KYLE
Well Ike, YOU can tell CARTMAN that
it's MY TRIANGLE!!

IKE
Baba MY babamama.

CARTMAN
Well, you can tell Kyle he's a dirty
goddamn son of a bitch!!

IKE
Koyle a goddam sonna ba.

KYLE
Alright, alright! If it means that
much to you, TAKE the stupid
triangle!!

CARTMAN
Huh?

Kyle storms over to the dresser and picks up the triangle.

KYLE
If it'll make you leave me alone,
then just take the damn thing, here!!

Kyle hands Cartman the triangle. Cartman is speechless.

KYLE
There! Now get out of my house and I
hope you feel really, REALLY good
about yourself!

Cartman thinks.

CARTMAN
Hell yeah I do! I got the triangle!

Cartman happily walks out. Kyle jumps back in bed and pulls
the blanket over his head.

CARTMAN
(Offscreen in distance)
I got the tri-angle! I got the tri-
angle!

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD

Chef's family car drives up the snowpacked mountain road.

INT. CHEF'S CAR

LEONARD MALTIN
Are you sure Barbara Streisand has a
condo up here?

CHEF
It was just a rumor... A lot of big
celebrities have mountain condos.

LEONARD MALTIN
Then we've got to keep looking...

Chef stops the car.

CHEF
Alright, Leonard Maltin, this has
gone far enough! I ain't driving
another mile until you tell me what
this is all about!!

Leonard Maltin takes a deep breath.

LEONARD MALTIN
Haven't you ever been curious about
the insanity Barbara Streisand
exhibits?

CHEF
Well, I always heard she was kind of
a bitch, but-

LEONARD MALTIN
MORE THAN A BITCH, Mr. Chef!! She is
a calculating, self-centered
egotistical... bitch. She was born
in a small town, her mother was a
Jackel and her father was an insurance
salesman!

CHEF
(He gets a chill)
Woo... Insurance salesman?

LEONARD MALTIN
(Rapidly)
When she was five, she knew that she
wanted to be a famous singer. But by
the time she was six, her ambitions
became to rule the universe. She
learned of an ancient diamond. The
diamond of Pantheous.

CHEF
Okay, you know what? Never mind. I
don't need to know all this -- forget
I asked.

Chef starts to drive again.

LEONARD MALTIN
(Very quickly)
Before she was seven, the keepers of
Pantheous learned of this insane
little girl's wish. The diamond was
split up and buried at opposite ends
of the world. But then, during the
shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbara
Streisand found one of the
triangles...

CHEF
And the other triangle is the one
that little Kyle has?

LEONARD MALTIN
Yes... Mr. Chef, if Babs gets a hold
of that other triangle, she will
fulfill her prophecy and become the
most threatening thing ever known to
mankind...

ZOOM IN on Leonard Maltin.

LEONARD MALTIN
MECHA-STREISAND.

CHEF
Mecha-Streisand? Oh man, I don't
know what the hell that means, but
it doesn't sound good!

EXT. BUSSTOP - MORNING

The boys are waiting for the bus to come.

STAN
Man, the bus sure is late.

CARTMAN
Hmmm, I wonder what I should do with
MY triangle, now that it is MY
triangle...

KYLE
Dammit, Cartman! I gave it to you so
you would SHUT UP!!

Just then, a nice, tan Honda Accord four door pulls up, and
a strange looking person gets out.

Actually, it's just Barbara Streisand wearing groucho glasses
with a mustache. She talks with a ridiculously disguised
voice.

DISGUISED BABS
Oh, hello there little boys. How are
you today?

STAN
Fine.

DISGUISED BABS
That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones.
And I am a very friendly, nice person.

The boys don't respond.

DISGUISED BABS
I hear that one of you found my
triangle.

KYLE
YOUR triangle?

DISGUISED BABS
Yes. You see, that triangle is part
of my Kidney Dialysis machine. I'm
so glad you found it, because without
it, I was sure to die within hours.

CARTMAN
Oh no you don't! Finders keepers!

DISGUISED BABS
But I'll die!

CARTMAN
Well I guess we'll have to Roshambo
for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as
hard as I can, then you kick me square
in the nuts as hard as you can.

DISGUISED BABS
I want to give you a BIG cash reward
for finding it. It's worth a lot of
money to me.

CARTMAN
It is?!

STAN
Hey, no wonder that Barbara Streisand
lady wanted it!

Babs eyes get wide.

DISGUISED BABS
Oh, ha, ha... Who is that?

KYLE
Oh, just this really, really old
lady who wishes she was still only
forty-five.

The boys all laugh. Babs gets furious.

STAN
Yeah! And you should have seen her
nose, it was big enough to land
Stealth Bombers on!

The boys laugh harder. Babs starts shaking with anger.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and talk about a bitch! I
haven't seen-

DISGUISED BABS
(Screaming)
ENOUGH!!!

The boys all reel back.

DISGUISED BABS
(Getting back in
character)
Uh, ha-ha... Anyway, if you'll come
with me in my car, I'll take you up
to my condo where I'll kill you -- I
mean -- give you money for the
triangle.

CARTMAN
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich!! Bet you
wish you wouldn't have given me back
that triangle NOW, huh, Kyle! DUMBASS!

Cartman follows Barbara to her car. The other boys shrug and
follow too.

KYLE
Wait, isn't there some rule about
not getting into cars with Strangers?

CARTMAN
No, not when money is involved,
stupid!

EXT. HOLLYWOOD STUDIO - DAY

Establishing shot of a lush, Hollywood Studio.

INT. HOLLYWOOD STUDIO - DAY

A large film crew is shooting around a large set of a living
room.

DIRECTOR
And... ACTION!!

Two actors, SIDNEY POITIER and SALLY STRUTHERS are doing a
scene together.

SIDNEY POITIER
Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any
other, with dreams and emotions. And
that's why I'll NEVER put a foreign
object up my ass.

DIRECTOR
Cut! Great, print that! Excellent
work, Sid. Take five guys, let's set
up for the next shot.

Sidney Poiter goes into his dressing room. The star on his
door does tell us this IS Sidney Poitier.

INT. SIDNEY POITIER'S DRESSING ROOM

Sidney walks in and plops down in front of his make-up table.

VOICES
HELLO?!

SIDNEY POITIER
Ho?

Sidney looks down on his make-up table where two very small
Japanese girls are standing in an oyster shell.

JAPANESE TWINS
You must hurry. A young man has found
the Triangle of Zinthar!

SIDNEY POITIER
Where?!

JAPANESE TWINS
A small, pissant white-bread mountain
town in Colorado called 'South Park'.

SIDNEY POITIER
Excellent...

Sidney smiles, is he evil or good?

INT. BARBARA'S CONDO - DAY

Barbara is back to her normal, bitchy self.

MS. STREISAND
Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will
be mine, and I WILL BE THE BIGGEST,
MOST FAMOUS PERSON EVER!!!!

The boys are all chained to the wall. The have shackles around
their ankles and wrists.

Cartman is in the middle, hooked up to some kind of torture
device.

CARTMAN
Let me go! Seriously!

STAN
Yeah! Let us go!!

MS. STREISAND
You fools have no idea the powers
that you are meddling with! I'll
teach you to meddle with MY TRIANGLE!!

Barbara pulls a lever. The ropes holding Cartman start to
pull him apart.

CARTMAN
AGHAGH!!!! IT'S NOT MY TRIANGLE!!
IT'S KYLE'S!!!!

KYLE
HEY! DON'T TRY TO PASS IT BACK ON
ME, FAT ASS!!

CARTMAN
(Still being pulled
apart)
SCREW YOU, HIPPIE!!

The torture continues. Cartman gets stretched further.

BARBARA STREISAND
WHERE IS THE TRIANGLE OF ZINTHAR?!

CARTMAN
I don't remember!

KYLE
Goddammit, tell her!! I wanna go
home!!

BARBARA STREISAND
Well... Maybe THIS will help JAR
YOUR MEMORY-

CARTMAN
No! Don't!

BARBARA STREISAND
(Singing)
There's a place for us...

CARTMAN
AGHAGHAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!

The boys all shake and struggle to break free.

MS. STREISAND
(Music stops)
NOW do you remember?!?!

The boys all gasp for breath, as if they've all been beaten
severely.

CARTMAN
Damn your black heart, Barbara
Streisand!!

STAN
I don't know how much more I can
take, dude.

MS. STREISAND
Alright, YOU ASKED FOR IT!!!
(Singing)
I'm gonna tell you now...

BOYS
NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

INT. CHEF'S CAR

Chef and Leonard Maltin are still driving.

CHEF
I don't know, man... Maybe Barbara
Streisand doesn't have a place up
here after all.

LEONARD MALTIN
Looks like we'll have to go to plan
B.

CHEF
There's a plan B? Why the hell have
we been driving around all night and
day for when there's a plan B?!?!

LEONARD MALTIN
Have you ever heard of the band called
'The Cure'?

CHEF
Oh, come on. Don't tell me The Cure
has something to do with this too!

LEONARD MALTIN
No, no... Just the lead singer. AGH!!

Suddenly, Leonard Maltin grabs his temples.

LEONARD MALTIN
AGH!!

CHEF
Woa, what's the matter, Leonard
Maltin?!

LEONARD MALTIN
She's close! She's very close! I can
feel her.

CHEF
Where?!

LEONARD MALTIN
She has the boys! They're in trouble!!

CHEF
Oh, fudge!!

LEONARD MALTIN
Keep going this way, hurry!!

Chef turns a corner and speeds up.

INT. BARBARA STREISAND'S 4 MILLION DOLLAR MOUNTAIN CONDO

BARBARA STREISAND
(Singing)
Happiness with you is like happiness
with...

BOYS
AAGHAGHAG!!!!

STAN
OKAY! OKAY! I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE
TRIANGLE IS!!!

Babs stops singing.

CARTMAN
IT'S INSIDE MY SHOE!!

Milo dashes over and takes off Cartman's shoe. As soon as he
does, the boys all react to the smell.

KYLE
Oh, for Christ's sake Cartman! When's
the last time you changed your socks?!

CARTMAN
And I suppose YOUR socks smell like
the botanical gardens!

Milo takes the triangle over to Babs. She holds it up and
looks at it with awe.

BARBARA STREISAND
Finally, the triangle is mine!!

Barbara storms over to the glass case and hits a button on
top.

BARBARA STREISAND
After centuries of waiting, I finally
have the triangle of Zinthar!!!

She reaches into the case and grabs the other triangle.

BARBARA STREISAND
NOW THE DIAMOND OF PANTHEOS IS
COMPLETE!!!

She slips the smaller blue triangle into the other triangle.
Immediately, the pair LOCK together and begin to spin, the
levitate of the ground in between the kids and Barbara
Striesand.

BARBARA STREISAND
SUGOI! KONO HI WA ATARASHII HAJIMARU
DA!! IMA KARA ATASHI NO NAMAE WA...

A FLASH of brilliant bright light and a laser shoot from the
levitating triangles.

STAN
Woa dude!!

It hits Barbara Streisand right in the chest. Instantly she
starts to grow. She busts right out of the roof of her condo
and keeps growing.

She keeps growing and expanding until she is a 800 FOOT TALL
HUGE METALLIC MONSTER BARBARA STREISAND!

MECHA STREISAND
MECHA-BARBARA STREISAND DA!!!!

Mecha-Babs lets out a tremendous ROAR! and walks off towards
South Park leaving the boys chained up in the roofless condo.

STAN
Dude, this is pretty fucked up, right
here.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

We see several of the little buildings, one of which is
Jimbo's gun shop.

Silence... Then FWOOM!!! A HUGE, MECHA FOOT Stomps on the
building, shattering it to bits.

BOOM UP to reveal Mecha Streisand in a typical Godzilla pose.

MECHA STREISAND
EYAAA!! ARGH!!!

JIMBO
Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest
goddamn deer I've ever SEEN!!

SECOND COMMERCIAL BREAK

ACT III

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

A normal looking NEWS REPORTER stands in front of South Park

All is very peaceful and quiet.

NEWS REPORTER
And so, just weeks after the
devastating attack of Mutant Genetic
creatures, zombies and Thanksgiving
Turkeys, The town of South Park has
managed to rebuild itself, once again
becoming-

KRAAA!!! Townspeople of South Park run screaming as Mecha
Barbara makes her way down South Park avenue, destroying all
the buildings as she goes.

NEWS REPORTER
Oh, goddammit not again...

Barbara easily destroys the buildings on South Park avenue.
People run screaming as a Japanese-style song takes over the
audio.

JAPANESE SINGER
Bar-Boo-RA!! Bar-Boo-RA!!! Ichiban
kirai no hito!! BA-BOO-RA!! BA BOO-
RA!!! Hana ga OOKII!!!!

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

We are looking towards the Mayor's desk and Window. The Mayor
is standing with her back to us looking out the window.

In the Window, we can see Mecha-Streisand destroying the
town.

Now angle reverses and we see the Mayor's shocked face with
wide open jaw.

In the background, the door opens and one of the aides pops
his head in.

AIDE
Mayor! Barbara Streisand is-

MAYOR
(Still staring out
window)
I noticed!!! CALL THE NATIONAL
GUARD!!!

The aide dashes off, closing the door.

The Mayor keeps looking out the window as we hear SCREAMING,
SIRENS and CRASHES in the distance.

MAYOR
We'll get you, you bitch... And to
think, I actually WATCHED your HBO
special...

INT. BARBARA STREISAND'S 4 MILLION DOLLAR MOUNTAIN CONDO

Chef and Leonard Maltin run into Barbara's evil lair, where
the boys are still chained to the wall.

CHEF
CHILDREN!!

BOYS
CHEF!!!

LEONARD MALTIN
Oh, no!

Leonard stands next to the broken case where the triangles
once were.

LEONARD MALTIN
She has joined the two triangles?

CARTMAN
YEAH! SHE STOLE MY TRIANGLE!

STAN
Get us down from here!!

Chef runs up to the boys and tries to free them.

CHEF
(Struggling)
I can't break these locks!!

LEONARD MALTIN
Stand back, Chef!

Chef takes a step away. Leonard Maltin gets in a martial
arts pose.

LEONARD MALTIN
(Japanese Accent)
MARUTIN RAY!!

Suddenly, red lasers shoot out of Leonard Maltin's eyes,
strike the chains and free the boys.

KYLE
Woa! That was cool!!

LEONARD MALTIN
I've got to go after Mecha-Streisand!
Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith
of The Cure at this number.

STAN
Robert Smith?! Sweet!!!

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - ENGLAND

In the FOREGROUND a red telephone rings.

ROBERT SMITH of The Cure walks over and picks up the phone.

ROBERT SMITH
Hello?

CHEF
Uh, yes, is this Robert Smith of the
Cure?

ROBERT SMITH
Yes it is.

CHEF
This may sound kind of strange, but
Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.

Suddenly, Robert Smith's expression becomes very dismal.
(More than usual).

ROBERT SMITH
Oh, Barbara Streisand's found the
other triangle, eh?

Chef looks suprised.

EXT. DENVER - DAY

The national guard has turned out to try and fight Mecha
Babs.

CAPTAIN
Alright, men!! Give her everything
you've got!!

A row of tanks pulls up in front of Mecha-Babs and starts
firing missles at her.

They seem to have no effect.

Five army helicopters fly in front of Mecha-Streisand's face.

INT. ONE OF THE HELICOPTERS

Jimbo is holding a large rocket launcher as Ned Pilot's the
helicopter.

JIMBO
GET AROUND SIDE HER, NED!! I CAN'T
GET A SHOT IN FROM HERE!!

NED
Okay.

They fly up near Bab's scary face, her huge eye looks at
them with anger.

NED
(Flatly)
Aaagh. Aaaagh. I'm scared.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

Mecha-Babs looks at the helicopter with Jimbo and Ned inside
just as Jimbo fires his rocket launcher.

Babs reels back only slightly from the rocket's impact, then
with a huge ROAR swings her large mechanical arm at the
helicopter, sending it spinning to the ground.

JAPANESE SINGER
Ba-Boo-RA!! Ba-Boo-RA!! Sugoi na
Bitchu da!!!

CAPTAIN
It's no use!! Our firepower has no
effect!!

Suddenly, Kyle's mother comes running up.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh my God! It IS YOU!!!

Mecha-Barbara looks down.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh I am SUCH a huge fan, Ms.
Streisand!! I never thought I'd live
to see you in person!!

MECHA STREISAND
KRAGHGHGH!!!!

KYLE'S MOTHER
I hate to ask this, but, could I get
an autograph? My sister would DIE!

MECHA STREISAND
KRAGHGHG!!!

Mecha-Streisand leans down, picks up the small pen and head
shot from kyle's mother, signs it, and hands it back.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand!!

MECHA STREISAND
GRAGHGHGH!!!!

Mecha Streisand stomps on a couple more buildings and lays
waste to the entire town of South Park!

Buildings, cars and trains are thrown around like toys.

MR. GARRISON
We're doomed!! Goodbye, Mr. Hat!

JAPANESE SINGER
BA-BOO-RA!!! BA-BOO-RA!!!

Mecha-Babs lets out a huge cry, then continues through the
town.

LEONARD MALTIN
BARBARA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Babs stops and looks down at the ground, where Leonard Maltin
stands in front of her. BABS almost looks scared for a
moment... Then lets out a loud cry.

Leonard Maltin crosses his arms over his chest.

LEONARD MALTIN
KITTE! KITTE! CHURI-PU!!!

Suddenly, Leonard Maltin starts to grow!! Babs watches in
shock as Leonard Maltin becomes ULTRA-LEONARD MALTIN!!

JAPANESE VOICE
(Out of nowhere)
ULLLTURAAA MARUTIN!!!!

Finally, when Leonard is the same size as Babs, he gets in a
Kung-Fu fighting stance.

Babs gets in a stance of her own, and the two start fighting
each other.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

Chef and the boys come running in to see Mecha-Streisand and
Ultra-Maltin fighting.

Everything around them is burning and crashing to the ground.

CHEF
Look out, children!!

Mecha-Streisand's huge foot crashes down next to Kenny and
smashes a car. People run through frame, screaming.

A flaming storefront then crashes down, the boys jump out of
the way, just in time.

Just then, Kenny walks over to a Tetherball pole and boredly
hits the ball. The rope to the ball gets caught around Kenny's
neck, and Kenny gets strangled up next to the pole.

Kenny turns blue, then purple, then pink.

Mecha-Streisand hits Ultra-Maltin and his huge body falls to
the ground, just missing Chef and the boys.

Kyle turns around and sees Kenny, wrapped around the
Tetherball pole.

STAN
Oh my God!! They killed Kenny!!

KYLE
You bastards!!

Suddenly, an older black man flies down next to Chef.

SIDNEY POITIER
What's going on, here?!

CHEF
Sidney Poitier?!?!

SIDNEY POITIER
That's right, I'm Sidney Poitier.

CHEF
Damn man, it's nice to meet you! THE
Sidney Poitier in MY home town!!

SIDNEY POITIER
Barbara Streisand has found the
triangle of Zinthar?

CHEF
Yup. She's made the diamond of
Pantheos, alright.

SIDNEY POITIER
KOO_RA KOO RA SUKI!!!

Sidney Poitier turns into a Gamera-turtle thing Sidney Poitier
and flies over to help Leonard Maltin do battle.

JAPANESE SINGER
MEGA POITIER!! MEGA POITIER!! SUGOI
KUROI DA NE!!! MEGA POITIER!! MEGA
POITIER!!

Chef looks to his right, where we actually see the Japanese
singer, in a suit, singing into a microphone.

CHEF
Is that really necessary?

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

Now shit is REALLY going down.

The boys watch in awe as Helicopters, tanks and missles fly
at Mecha-Babs as she wrestles and fights with both Ultra
Maltin and Mega-Poitier.

Mecha-Streisand is the obvious stronger, as she picks up
Mega Poitier, spins him over her head and throws him over
the mountains.

Ultra-Maltin tries his eye lasers, but Mecha-Babs just puts
out her hand, and stops them easily.

Then she tilts her head back, and shoots BIGGER lasers out
her nose, which strike Leonard Maltin and send him flying
backwards in pain.

Mecha-Babs throws her arms up in victory.

CHEF
It's over... She's too strong for
them children. We'll have to leave
town.

CARTMAN
Make it go away!! I hate Barbara
Streisand! I hate her!!

STAN
My mom always said there are no
monsters, but there are, aren't there,
Chef...

CHEF
We have to say goodbye to South
Park...

Mecha-Babs continues her havoc.

Just then, Robert Smith walks up to Chef and the boys.

ROBERT SMITH
Am I too late?

CHEF
Who are you?

STAN
Dude! That's Robert Smith of The
Cure!

CARTMAN
Sweet!!

ROBERT SMITH
Here, you boys hold this walkie. You
can help me fight her.

Robert hands the boys a small walkie talkie.

CHEF
You can try Robert Smith, but that
thing just beat the crap out of
Leonard Maltin AND Sidney Poitier!!

ROBERT SMITH
I have to try. I can't let Barbara
Streisand do this to the entire world.

Robert Smith spins around...

JAPANESE SINGER
ROB-ATO SUMISU!! ROB-ATO SUMISU!!

Mecha-Babs turns around and sees the thriving metropolis of
Denver in the distance. She smiles a big mechanical smile
and heads towards it.

But then, behind her another huge figure appears. It is
Mothora Robert Smith!!!

Now Babs looks really, really scared.

Robert opens his huge mouth and lets out one of his high
pitched screams.

Babs tries to cover her ears as windows all over the buildings
still standing shatter.

Mecha-Babs retaliates with her own high pitched note. Robert
covers his ears and even more windows break.

Stan has the little talkie around his wrist. Leonard Maltin,
back to normal size and looking severely beaten, walks up
next to the boys.

LEONARD MALTIN
We must tell him that her weak point
is the nose...

Stan talks into the walkie.

STAN
Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot
punch!

The huge Robert Smith looks down at Stan and nods.

Just then Mecha-Babs charges Smith!! But Smith hits a switch
on his arm which sends the end of his arm flying!!

It hits Babs square in the nose.

Babs reels back with a horrific scream. The Diamond of
Pantheos flies out of her nose and lands right at Kyle's
feet.

KYLE
The diamond of Pantheos!! She must
be powerless now!!

STAN
(Into walkie)
Quickly, Robert Smith, she's
powerless!!

Robert runs up to the Dazed Mecha-Streisand and grabs her by
the mechanical tail.

He spins her round and round and round...

JAPANESE SINGER
ROBAT-O SUMISU!! ROBAT-O SUMISU!!!

Finally, after gaining enough momentum, Robert lets go. And
Mecha-Streisand goes flying into outer space.

EXT. SPACE

Mecha-Streisand flies outward from Earth and continues on
past the moon.

She lets out a horrific cry. As her huge body gets past the
moon, it explodes like a nuclear bomb. Body pieces flying
everywhere.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

The explosion in the sky looks beautiful from South Park.
Like a huge firework.

STAN
He DID IT!!!

KYLE
NO MORE BARBARA STREISAND EVER!!!

STAN
Wow, Robert Smith is the greatest
person that ever lived!!

JESUS
Our Savior!!

Robert Smith shrinks back to normal size.

ROBERT SMITH
Can I have my walkie talkie back
now, please?

Cartman is holding it now.

CARTMAN
No way! You gave it to us!! It's
MINE now!!

ROBERT SMITH
Alright, I'll Roshambo you for it.

CARTMAN
Huh?

Robert Smith kicks Cartman in the nuts.

Robert Smith walks away.

CHEF
Hey, where is he going?

STAN
Goodbye Robert Smith!!!

CARTMAN
Thank you for your help. Visit us
again.

KYLE
'Disinigration' is the best album
ever!!

Robert Smith walks away to the setting sun.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #3

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE

Kyle has the two triangles of Zinthar.

STAN
Well, what should we do with the two
triangles now?

KYLE
We've got to get rid of them. NOBODY
should have the kind of power Barbara
Streisand wanted.

Kyle throws the triangles in the trash.

STAN
Well, at least I have this sweet
walkie talkie Robert Smith gave me.

CARTMAN
No! That's MY walkie-talkie! He gave
it to ME!!

KYLE
Dammit, Cartman don't you ever learn
anything?!

In the back ground, Ike hops over to the trash and reaches
in.

CARTMAN
Come on, Stan! it's MINE! I'll
Roshambo you for it!

STAN
Go to hell, Cartman!

The boys walk outside as Ike picks the two triangles out of
the trash.

EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE

KYLE
Well, that whole experience sure did
suck.

STAN
Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with!

KYLE
But you know, I've learned something
today. I've learned that people who
want power, a lot of power, always...
end up dead.

STAN
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Yes, and I've learned something too.
Robert Smith kicks ass.

The ground rumbles. The boys look around in panic.

CARTMAN
Oh, no!! She's back!!!

STAN
Oh my God! LOOK!!

A HUGE, HUGE IKE steps out from behind the house.

BOYS
AGHGHGH!!!!! MECHA-IKE!!!!

STAN
Dude, did you do all your homework last
night?

KYLE
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I

STAN
I know!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, I hope you all did your
homework last night, because we're goin'
to talk about pages 42 through 612.
First of all, who can tell me what year
the Founding Fathers got together?
Let's see, how about...

CARTMAN
Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus,
don't let him call on me.

MR. GARRISON
Wendy?

CARTMAN
Phew!

WENDY
1776.

MR. GARRISON
Good job, Wendy. And what was that document
called?

CARTMAN
Oh, please, God, don't let him call
on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-


MR. GARRISON
Kyle?

CARTMAN
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!


KYLE
The Declaration of Independence?

MR. GARRISON
Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me
what famous person wrote the Declaration
of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know.
How about the new student, Timmy?


TIMMY
Timmiihh!

MR. GARRISON
Nno, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.


TIMMY
Heh-aaaaaah!

MR. GARRISON
Timmy, did you not do your homework?!


TIMMY
Erh Timmiihh!!

STAN
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured
it out? Timmys' retarded.

MR. GARRISON
Don't call people names, Stanley!

STAN
But he is-

MR. GARRISON
Now, Timmy,

TIMMY
Haaaaah.

MR. GARRISON
You need to work on your study skills!


TIMMY
Doo-uhh.

MR. GARRISON
Are you mocking me?! Because if you
are, I have no problem sending your
butt to the principal's office!

TIMMY
G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!


MR. GARRISON
THAT DOES IT!

[The principal's office. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey talk
to Timmy]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, Timmy. I just don't know what
to do with you. You're getting very
poor marks in school and the teachers
are complaining that you aren't paying
attention.

TIMMY
Heh-aaaaaah!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh young man, if you don't wanna be
held back a grade, I suggest you start
cooperating, m'kay?!

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, that does it! I'm suspending you,
Timmy, until you can learn to respect
your elders!

TIMMY
Ehhha-a-a-ah.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal
Victoria.  I think I may know what the
problem is.

TIMMY
Timmiihh.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yes, of course.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What??

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I think maybe Timmy is suffering from
something called, "Attention Deficit
Disorder," or ADD. It's very common
in kids his age.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh!

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, that certainly would explain it.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
It should be easy enough to find out.
They have tests for that kind of thing
now, m'kay?

TIMMY
Oolih oo livn' a lie, Timmehuh!

[A clinic. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey have taken Timmy
there to see a doctor]

CLINIC DOCTOR
Alright, this is a very sinple test
which should determine without a doubt
whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit
Disorder.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Good.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay.

TIMMY
Timmih.

CLINIC DOCTOR
Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you
a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by
F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the
novel I'll ask you a few questions.
Are yiou ready?

TIMMY
Timmih.

CLINIC DOCTOR
Okay, here we go.  "In my younger and
more vulnerable years, my father gave
me some advice that I've been turning
over in my mind ever since"  "so we
beat on, boats against the current,
borne back ceaselessly into the past."


TIMMY
Ha-a-a-a-a-h.

CLINIC DOCTOR
Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In
Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby
drive?

TIMMY
Timmih!

CLINIC DOCTOR
Well, that settles it!

CLINIC DOCTOR
This young man definitely has Attention
Deficit Disorder!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
What can we do for him, doctor?

CLINIC DOCTOR
Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today.
I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and
we'll see how that goes for little Timmy.


TIMMY
Timmih.

[South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Garrison's classroom]


MR. GARRISON
Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.
You'd better have done your homework
last night, Timmy.  What's this?


TIMMY
Tim-mih.

MR. GARRISON
A note from the principal? "Please excuse
Timmy from all questions and all homework,
as he has been diagnosed with Attention
Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother!

STAN
He doesn't have to do homework?

MR. GARRISON
That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like
you've outsmarted the principal and
the counselor!

TIMMY
Timmih.

MR. GARRISON
Very well, I guess you're excused from
homework.

KYLE
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention
Diffunction Disorder.

CARTMAN
Yeah, me too.

STAN
I've got ADD.

KENNY
(Me too.)

OTHER CLASSMATES
Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's
gay.

[The clinic, later. The doctor is reading "A Farewell To Arms,"
by Ernest Hemingway, to the class now]

CLINIC DOCTOR
"After a while I went out and left the
hospital, and walked back to the hotel
in the rain."  Alright now, in Chapter
12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van
Campen talk about?  Anybody?  Anybody??
My God, these children all have ADD!


ALL THE KIDS
Hooray.

CARTMAN
Hoo-ray.

CLINIC DOCTOR
It's Ritalin for all of you!

DRUMMER
Dude, we suck!

SKYLER
Hey, that's not the right attitude,
Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow
night!

JONESY
Dude, we never win the Battle of the
Bands! It's no big deal.

SKYLER
Not a big deal! This year's winner
gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza,
and that's no big deal?!

MARK
Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.


SKYLER
We've just gotta practice more.

JONESY
Dude, we've been practicing for eight
years, Skyler.

SKYLER
Hey, am I the leader of this band or
not?! Huh, let's do it from the top!


TIMMY
Timmuuhh!  Coodalah Timmuh!

JONESY
What was that?

SKYLER
Huh-I don't know, man.  Whoaaa!

MARK
Who is that?

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

SKYLER
You a singer, man?

TIMMY
Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah!  Timmehuh!
Timmehh.

JONESY
Dude, that's hot!

SKYLER
Yeah!

[South Park Pharmacy, day. Ms. McCormick receives her son's prescription.]


PHARMACIST
There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick.
A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin.


Mrs. McCormick	And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?


PHARMACIST
We can only hope so. Next?

SHARON
Oh, hi, Sheila.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit
Disorder too?

SHARON
Yes. I should have known. It all makes
semse now. I could never get Stanley
to pay attention when his grandfather
told him stories about the '30s.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper,
sometimes he runs around and screams
like a little eight-year-old.

KYLE
...I am eight.

PHARMACIST
Next, please?  What do we have here-
ah! The Ritalin!

LIANE
Yes.

CARTMAN
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD.
No homework for me.

LIANE
Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't
have any side effects, does it?

PHARMACIST
Oh, no no no, your son may experience
a small lack of energy, but that's all.


LIANE
Alright.

PHARMACIST
Oh, and he might start seeing little
pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but
that's to be expected.

LIANE
Oh my.

[South Park Battle Of The Bands. A four-member band is onstage.
One member is on keyboards, a second is on drums, a third on
guitar, and the fourth has the mic. The first and third have
flaming hairdos]

BAND
Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light).
Lettin' it feel so light.

PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE
Boooo!

GUY IN FLAT TOP
You suck!

M.C.
Alright, that was "Sisters of Mercy
Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord,"
with their song, "Silk Blood On The
Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"


SINGER
We got the best response. We'll be opening
for Phil Collins for sure.

M.C.
And now it's time for our final band.


GUY IN AUDIENCE
Thank God!

M.C.
Give it up for "Timmy and the Lords
of the Underworld!"

SKYLER

TIMMY
Timmih!  Timmih! Lehmeheuh!  Timmih!


MAN 1

MAN 2
Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!

TIMMY

TIMMY
Timmih, Timmiih!

THE LORDS
Darkness fills my heart with pain.


TIMMY
Timmih oo livin' a lie!

STAN
Dude, it's Timmy.

KYLE
No way!

MAN 3
They're ridiculing that singer! Come

TIMMY
Sibilah Sibinlaahh!

THE LORDS
The Lords of the Underworld.

TIMMY
Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!


THE LORDS
Darkness fills my heart with pain.


TIMMY
Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih
Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh.
Timmeh!

CARTMAN
That was awesuhome!

STAN
Yeah, Timmy ruhules!

WOMAN
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's
handicapped!

STAN
But he's funny.

WOMAN
How would you like to be handicapped?!
Do you think that would be funny?! You're
making him feel bad!

TIMMY
Hehaahh!

STAN
He looks pretty happy to me.

WOMAN
Oh, you people make me sick!

M.C.
Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's
Battle of the Bands winner and the band
that gets to open for Phil Collins at
Lalapalablala.is... TIMMY!

CROWD
Wooo!

JONESY
We did it, dude!

SKYLER
Listen to them. They really love me.
Wooo!!

CROWD
Wooo!!

SKYLER
Yes! I'm a rocker!

[PSB presents Charlie Rose]

CHARLIE ROSE
Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation,
Timmeo , the controversial new band
that has taken the country by storm.
Already playing at several large venues
this month , the band prepares for its
biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they
will open for Phil Collins. But Phil
Collins is not happy.

PHIL COLLINS
Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy,
idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna
see Timmy for his musical skills. They're
laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't
laugh at people with disabilities!


MAN
Hah haha.

PHIL COLLINS
Society has to learn how to be more
compassionate! This is gonna stop if
I have to stop it myself!

[Bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle await the bus]

KYLE
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins
was saying about Timmy?

STAN
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times
more talented than he is.

CARTMAN
Hey guys, have you been takin' your
Ritalin?

STAN
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take
that stuff.

CARTMAN
No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes
you feel good.

KENNY
(Good.)

[South Park Elementary, day, kitchen]

CHEF
Hello there, children.

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Hello, Chef.

KENNY
(Hello, Chef.)

CHEF
How's it goin'?

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Very well, thank you.

KENNY
(Very well, thank you.)

CHEF
Everything's fine?? Why??

STAN
Because we're on Ritalin.

CHEF
What??

KYLE
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder.
So we all started taking Ritalin.


CARTMAN
It really takes the edge off, man. You
should try it.

CHEF
So that's why all you children are acting
so damned boring!

KYLE
That's correct, Chef.

CHEF
Damnit, children, you don't need drugs
to make you pay attention in school!
In my day, if we didn't pay attention
we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're
tryin' to cure everything with drugs!


KYLE
Yes, but now we don't have any homework,
so we can go see Timmy play downtown
at Mile High Stadium

STAN
Oh boy oh boy.

KENNY
(Oh boy.)

CHEF
Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists
prescribe all kinds of medicines to
you children without even carin' about
the side effects.

STAN
But there are no side effects, Chef.


KYLE
No, not at all.

CARTMAN
Did you guys see that?

STAN
See what?

[MTV News. A satellite revolves around the logo]

ANNOUNCER
You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing,
twelve-year-old-and-younger station
that hides behind a slick image. We're
so cool that we decide what's cool.
And now, MTV News, the news that is
singlehandedly dumbing down our country.
Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt
Loder

KURT LODER
Why am I still doing this? I've got
to be the oldest person in this network
by at least 40 years.

ANNOUNCER
Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No
way, he did just say it, but just to
be cool. That's what makes him cool.
You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now,
the news that's cool.

KURT LODER
Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa,
and the headlining band has changed.
Now headlining the event is Timmy ,
the new hit sensation out of Colorado.
This news came as a shock to the performer
that was going to headline Lalapalabala,
Phil Collins.

PHIL COLLINS
Well, I think the sad question is,
"Where are the parents in all this?"
I mean, that kid's parents are lettin'
him be exploited, and they don't even
seem to care.

KURT LODER
And so, Phil Collins decided to travel
to South Park and personally pay Timmy's
parents a visit.

PHIL COLLINS
Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em
do this to your son? Don't you see that
everyone's just laughin' at him?

RICHARD
Richarrrrd!

HELEN
Helennnn!

RICHARD
'Oodleahah.

KURT LODER
Phil Collins warns that a novelty band
that makes fun of the handicapped should
not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala,
and vows to do everything in his power
to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way,
divorced his wife via fax and then married
a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's
the news.

[South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's class. The school
bell rings]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's settle down!
Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God,
Mr. Hat, these children are so boring
on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children,
today we're gonna learn about human
reproduction. What do you think about
that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.
Well, damnit, Eric, don't you have
some smartass thing to say?!

CARTMAN
What kind of smartass thing would I
say, Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
This is driving me crazy!! I can't
handle you little bastards being so
mellow!!

KYLE
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr.
Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin?


CARTMAN
There you go.

CARTMAN
Whah!

[MILE HIGH STADIUM
"Tonight Only. TIMMY!!! Sold Out."]


A SINGER
Thank you, South Park! Good night!


JONESY
Alright, let's rock this house! Hello
Miami!

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

PHIL COLLINS
Excuse me, Skyler Moles?

SKYLER
Yeah?

PHIL COLLINS
Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.


SKYLER
Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.


PHIL COLLINS
I just wanted to tell you that, well,
I think that you're a great guitar player
and song writer.

SKYLER
Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that.
Gotta run.

PHIL COLLINS
It's too bad those other guys are holdin'
you back.

SKYLER
Huh?

PHIL COLLINS
Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent
and artistic vision in the band comes
from you. Strange, how everyone focuses
n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the
name of the band is "Timmy,"

SKYLER
Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy
and the Lords of the Underworld.

PHIL COLLINS
Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis.
And all those bastards did was hold
me back and hold me back. But then,
finally, I went solo. And that's when
I started writing really great songs.
But look, if you happen to be on the
sidelines, you know, bein' more of a
cheerleader than a player, well, then
I guess you should stay on as Timmy's
shadow.

SKYLER
Uh, thanks man. See ya.

PHIL COLLINS
That should just about put an end to
all this Timmy nonsense.

[Mile High Stadium, later.]

TIMMY
Timmuh!

JONESY
Another great show, man. There must
have been a hundred thousand people
out there.

SKYLER
Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy,
Timmy."

TIMMY
Timmih!

JONESY
What's the matter, Skyler?

SKYLER
The name of the band is Timmy AND the
Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.


TIMMY
Timmiihh!

SKYLER
And the Lords of the Underworld!

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

SKYLER
It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm
sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause!
Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you
know what?! Forget you, man!

MARK
Skyler, Timmy is what made our band
famous.

SKYLER
Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal
with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm novin'
on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin'
solo!

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

SKYLER
No! Don't try and stop me, man!  I'll
see you on fame's backside.

TIMMY
Ooo livin' a lie!

[Cartman's house, next day. The boys are on the sofa watching
Terrance and Phillip. Stan has his Ritalin, Cartman has the remote...
and a pan on his laps. He's eating bacon]

PHILLIP
Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?


TERRANCE
Let me see.

PHILLIP
How do you like that, Terrance?

STAN
Let's watch something else.

KYLE
Yes, let's.

ANNOUNCER
You're watching VH1.

THE BOYS
Ahhhh.

ANCHOR
Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit
group Timmy has broken up.

STAN
Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?

ANCHOR
And so, Phill Collins is back on as
the headliner. The opening band now
will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new
solo project, Reach for the Skyler.


KYLE
You know something? I think that's good.
It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.


STAN
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People
laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be
at home, where he's protected from laughter.


CARTMAN
I agree. You know what, you guys? We
should go to the concert anyways and
see Phil Collins.

KYLE
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the
house.

STAN
Sounds good.

CARTMAN
So it's decided: Phil Collins concert
for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold
still, Kenny.

STAN
Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.

KYLE
Bastard.

[The Marsh house. Several parents are gathered in the living
room. Chef speaks]

CHEF
Parents, I called you all together because
I think you might be making a mistake
puttin' your children on Ritalin.


RANDY
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit
Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention
in school without it.

CHEF
I know you wanna help your kids, but
I brought over a videotape to show you
that there are alternatives to Ritalin.
There's this doctor in Northern California
who is doing really amazing kids with
children who have ADD. I want you to
watch this tape.

DR. SHAY
Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to
tell you about exciting new drug-free
treatment for children with Attention
Deficit Disorder.  This treatment is
fast and effective and doesn't use harmful
drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment
to the first child.

GIRL
I want a horse. I want a big brown
horse with a brown-and-black tail, and
a diamond tiara-  Ah!

DR. SHAY
Sit down and study!

BOY 1
Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go
race and race, let's go!

DR. SHAY
Sit down and study!

BOY 1
Wwaaahahahah

DR. SHAY
Stop crying and do your schoolwork!
If you would like more information
on my bold new treatment, please send
away for this free brochure, entitled,
"You can either calm down, or I can
pop you in the mouth again." Thank you.


CHEF
Well, what do you think? I can have
Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small
fee.

SHARON
That video had pretty colors.

KYLE'S FATHER
It sure did.

CHEF
What the? Damnit, have you all been
taking your children's Ritalin too?!


PARENTS
Yes.

CHEF
Awww, fudge it!

STAN
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins
concert tomorrow?

CHEF
The what??

KYLE
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's,
and because we're all doing so well
in school now, our parents said they
would take us.

PARENTS
Yes.

CHEF
Hold on a second: you children want
to go see Phil Collins?

KYLE
Yes. His flowing melodies are really
enjoyable to us.

CHEF
Oh my God!!

KYLE
Come, see him with us.

CARTMAN
Yes, come with us. Come with uusss.
Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera agan!
She's on my back! Hah!

CHEF
That does it! That Ritalin has affected
your little cracker brains too deeply!
I'm going to go see that damn phramacist!


[South Park Pharmacy, after hours. The pharmacist and the clinic
doctor are talking, and the doctor counts some money]

PHARMACIST
Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up
ten points.

CLINIC DOCTOR
That's easily another twenty grand apiece!


CHEF
Hey, open this damn door.

PHARMACIST
Can I help you?

CHEF
Yes you can! What the hell are you two
doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!


CLINIC DOCTOR
Well, they've all been diagnosed with
ADD. That's Attention Deficit-

CHEF
I know what it is! But now you've got
a town full of zombie children from
the planet Zandor.

CLINIC DOCTOR
Huh?

CHEF
All around the country, you bastard
doctors are giving children Ritalin!
And for every one child that actually
needs it, you give it to 50,000 that
don't!

CLINIC DOCTOR
Hey now, don't tell us our business,
Mr. Chef. Why, we-

CHEF
You're damn right I'll tell you yo'
business, because you two have got your
heads up your asses! Thanks to you,
we have children in our town that like
Phil Collins!

PHARMACIST
Eh wuh, what??

CHEF
That's right! You've made them so dull
and boring that they'er actually going
to go to a Phil Collins concert!

CLINIC DOCTOR
Mm- my God. What have we done??

PHARMACIST
Well, if I had known... Phl Collins, uh,
my God!

CHEF
Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!


CLINIC DOCTOR
We uh... have to convince them not to
take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard
to get it away from them.

CHEF
Then we need an antidote!

PHARMACIST
Yes, of course.

CLINIC DOCTOR
Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?


PHARMACIST
I have some right here.  It's a compound
called "Ritalout."

CHEF
Alright. Come on, we've got to get the
antidote to all the children. Quick!


Welcome to

LALAPALALAPAZA!!

[Townsfolk file in. Music is piped in before the concert]

lalapalalapaza 2000

PHIL COLLINS


Last night I went, "O!"

Bubudio

Last night I went "Bubudio"

CHEF
Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote
in these drinks and hand them out to
the children.

PHIL COLLINS
Last night I went, "O!"

Bububudio. [takes a bow. People clap a bit]

RANDY
Wasn't that great, son?

STAN
Sure was, Dad.

KYLE'S FATHER
It's so wonderful to be on the same
wavelength as our kids.

CHEF
Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks
on me.

STAN
Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice.

PHIL COLLINS
I know. I'd like to sing the complex
and amazing song that won me the Oscar,
a song entitlted, "You'll Be In... Me."
Thanks.

You're inside of me.

Deep inside of me. [Chef hands drinks to more kids]

So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.

CHEF
Come on, drink it down. It's free.


CARTMAN
You'll be inside of me...

CARTMAN
Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off
me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody
get it off of me!! Get it off of me.


STAN
I feel... different.

KYLE
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?!
Please! Hegh, hegh

CHEF
Drink this, Eric.  God help me! Heh,
get it...  She's gone! Thank God!

PHIL COLLINS
Well, thanks!

STAN
Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!


KYLE
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?!
Boooooo!

CHEF
I think it's working.

AUDIENCE
Booooo!!

PHIL COLLINS
Shut your filthy holes, you little
bastards!

STAN
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We
want Timmy!

KYLE
Yeah!

PHIL COLLINS
You just wanna laugh at him.

STAN
No!  You see, we learned something today.
Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but
what's wrong with laughter? Just because
we laugh at something doesn't mean we
don't care about it. Timmy made us smile,
and playing made Timmy smile, so where
was the harm in that? The people that
are wrong are the ones that think people
like Timmy should be "protected" and
kept out of the public's eye. The cool
thing about Timmy being in a band was
that he was in your face, and you had
to deal with him, whether you laughed
or cried, or felt nothing. That's why
Timmy rules!

KYLE
Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!

AUDIENCE
Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!

[A desert near town. Mark and Timmy stand outside, Jonesy sits
on the running board]

JONESY
Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala.


MARK
Yeah.

SKYLER
Hey dudes.

JONESY
Skyler, what are you doing here?!  Isn't
Reach for the Skyler supposed to play

SKYLER
They booed Phil Collins off the stage.
Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the
Lords of the Underworld.

MARK
Oh, so now that they want us, you think
you can waltz, um, back into our lives
and be in the band again?

SKYLER
I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh...
Well, I just wanted to say we had some
pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe
I let fame and Phil Collins go to my
head...

TIMMY
Timmih!

JONESY
Wow. They really are chanting for us.


MARK
Hn they want us back.

SKYLER
What do you say, Timmy?

TIMMY
Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih.

THE LORDS
Alright!

[The Lalapalalapaza concert.]

HOST
Ladies and gentlemen, without further
ado, it is my pleasure to introduce
the reunion tour of Timmehuh!

TIMMY

[the field]

KYLE
Aw God, I'm so borrred.

BUTTERS
I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug.


UMPIRE
Strike.

MR. BARKAS
That was no strike! What the hell is
wrong with you, ref?

RANDY
Good call, ref! Good call!

MR. BARKAS
Come on, Alan! This pitcher throws like
a girl!

RANDY
What'd you say?!

MR. BARKAS
You heard me, asshole!

RANDY
You want me to kick your ass right here?!


SHARON
Randy, sit down.

MR. BARKAS
You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm
pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!


RANDY
Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna
do?

SHARON
Randy, don't!

MR. BARKAS
You'd better shut up, asshole!

RANDY
I'm standin' right here! How do you
wanna handle it?

MR. BARKAS
I told you to SHUT UP!

STAN
Aw Jesus, not again.

[moments later]

KYLE
Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid
out so we can end the season!

UMPIRE
Strike three! You're out!

STAN
Yes! It's over! It's over!

LOCAL ANNOUNCER 1
That's it. South Park wins the game
4 to 0.

CARTMAN
We're done! No more baseball!

KYLE
No more boring baseball until next year!


STAN
We can start having fun again!

CARTMAN
All right, we did it!

STAN
We did it! We did it!

STEVEN
Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're
going to the finals! Woohoo!

STAN
... What?

STEVEN
Well we won! That means we've got the
best record in the division!

KYLE'S FATHER
Congratulations, boys! You're goin'
on to the post-season. Woohoo!

CARTMAN
Post-season?

KYLE
Nobody said anything about a post-season.


TOM
There's more little-league baseball
for South Park! Yehheah!

STAN
No... NOOO!!

[Outside, after the game. Randy is hauled off to a waiting patrol
car, drunk and tattered. His pants are down to his ankles]


RANDY
This is for what?! Arresting me for
what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for
myself?! I thought this was America!
Huh?! Isn't this America!? I'm sorry,
I thought this was America!

[Whistlin' Willy's, night. The boys are gathered there for a
pizza dinner]

KYLE
I can't believe it. I can't believe
we have to keep on playing.

CARTMAN
Nobody told us if we win too many games
we'd go on to the finals!

STAN
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that
bad.

CRAIG
Not all that bad?? How could you say
that?! You hate this game more than
any of us!

STAN
I know, but listen: the finals are all
sudden-deatn elimination, right? That
means as soon as we lose one game, our
season is over.

BUTTERS
Well yeah, but... we usually win.

CRAIG
All the other teams are worse than us.


JIMMY
Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners.


STAN
I know we can lose if we try.

KYLE
You mean, throw the game? You know how
our parents are about this sport.


BUTTERS
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay
to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're
grounded, Mister."

THE OTHER BOYS
Yeah, uh huh.

STAN
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other
team quietly that we're gonna let them
win, and then we'll act like we're trying.
Our parents will never know.

BUTTERS
We'd better hope they never know, or
else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck,
I tell ya!

[At the entrance of Whistlin' Willy's, the adults are gathered,
relaxing]

KYLE'S FATHER
Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!

MR. DONOVAN
Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em!


RANDY
Heeey!

MEN
Heeey!

STEVEN
You're out.

KYLE'S FATHER
How much was bail this time?

STAN
Hundred bucks, no big whoop.

RICHARD
Boy, you really beat the crap out of
that Conifer dad.

RANDY
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead
in his place.

STEVEN
Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself
in the playoffs.

RANDY
Wha-what do you mean?

STEVEN
I mean, you always get in a fight with
scrappy redneck dats up here in the
mountains, but some of those Division
Two dads are tough!

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and
obnoxious.

RANDY
I can fight anybody. I just need to
train. I just need to get in the best
shape of my life.

DJ
-the Beatles in the White Album in Helter
Skelter. Okay.

[Randy rises from the bed and sits up, leaves the bed and shrugs,
and wipes his nose a bit. He enters the kitchen, gets a glass,
then goes to the refrigerator. He gets three eggs, cracks them
open on the rim of the glass, and pours them into the glass.
He picks up the glass and moves off a bit, then pours the eggs
into a hot pan and scrambles them. He then picks up a beer, drinks,
burps, and farts]

[Fort Collins baseball field, night]

FC ANNOUNCER
We want to welcome all South Park parents
to Fort Collins, and the Little League

and had to do this lousy-ass tournament!


FC CATCHER
We wanna play video games.

BUTTERS

STAN
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight,

FC PITCHER

UMPIRE

UMPIRE
¡Ball cuatro, por favor!

RANDY
This is America! This is an honest America!


[Whistlin' Willy's. The team is at table again, but with a trophy
they didn't want. The adults begin to approach them]

STEVEN
Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing
in the State Championship Game!

KYLE
We're so proud of you kids!

CARTMAN
What happens if we win the State Championship
game?

STEVEN
Well, then your whole season starts
over, but on the national circuit! You
get to spend your whole summer playing
baseball!

KYLE
What??

MR. DONOVAN
You could do it, kids! We know you can
win State!

STEVEN
Then we'll spend the whole summer going
to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming.


STAN
Oh no. No, no, no!

[Outside the restaurant, day. Randy stands by the curb looking
into space. He has a black eye. The doors open and Stan walks
out]

STAN
Dad? Dad, we need to talk.

RANDY
Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship
game. It's... the greatest thing ever.


STAN
Goddamnit.

RANDY
I've worked hard, believed in myself,
and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State
Championship game.  This is gonna be
the biggest fight of my life.

[South Park News]

ANNOUNCER
This is News 4, at noon.

[Coors Field, in Denver]

ANCHOR TOM
The Colorado Little League State Championship
is being played this week. Two teams
of youngsters get to go head to head
at the major-league stadium downtown.


REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing here with the little
sluggers and some of their parents,
and I can;t tell you how excited they
are.

STAN
I don't suppose you guys want to win
this game.

DENVER PLAYER
Win? Why the hell would we want to win?


DENVER PLAYER 2
Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring
game all summer.

REPORTER
Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for
the South Park Little League team, and
Stan, how does it feel to be playing
for the State Championship?

STAN
Gay.

REPORTER
Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of
your son.

RANDY
They've worked really hard to get here,
Chris, and, you know, I don't like to
really "trash-talk," but, I don't think
Denver has a chance.

REPORTER CHRIS
Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver
kids' parents would disagree with you
and your team-

BAT DAD
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!  South Park is goin'
down! Feel it comin'!  You ain't got
a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver,
here we go! Huh, huh!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Who's that?

A WOMAN
That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver
players' fathers. He goes to every game
in that ridiculous outfit and usually
drinks too much and gets into a fight.


TOM NELSON
There ain't no way some little mountain
kids can beat Denver. Not with my son
on second base!

REPORTER CHRIS
Oho, looks like we got some parental
trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh,
any comments?

RANDY
Well I think that there's a uh...

TOM NELSON
Mr. Marsh?? Who wants to hear from a
Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little
League trash-talking father! Iii am
the Bat Dad!

DENVER COP
All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come
on.

TOM NELSON
Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows
no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!


REPORTER CHRIS
Well, tension is certainly high here,
but I guess everything will be decided
on the playing field.

RANDY
Oh my God.

DENVER PLAYER 3
Good luck! You're gonna need it.

DENVER PLAYER 4
Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible.


KYLE
Dude, what are we gonna do?? We can't
win this game.

CARTMAN
Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth
point in a sports movie, the team always
goes out and finds a really sweet player
to join their team.

CLYDE
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News
Bears.

CARTMAN
Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need...
is to find somebody to join our team,
who totally sucks ass.

STAN
Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst
kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody
who can't possibly win.

CRAIG
But who?

KYLE
I know who.

[The airport, day]

ANNOUNCER
Announcing the arrival of flight six
seven three, from New York City.


KYLE 1
I'm baaack!

KYLE
There he is! Now, don't let him know
we think he's a loser, or else he won't
play.

KYLE 1
Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight
was terrible. They served a chicken
dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas.


KYLE
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining
our team.

KYLE 1
Well, you said you needed my help to
win the big game, so here I am. I'll
need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play,
though. Sometimes I sweat from holding
the bat for so long and then the heat
steams up my glasses.

CRAIG
He's perfect.

STAN
Yeah, with him on our team, we don't
stand a chance.

[Coors Field. No one is in there except Randy, who walks along
the stands looking around. He sees a sign that sais "Colorado
Little League State Championship." He moves along. Next, he's
at a beach far from Colorado looking at the sunset. He sneaks
back into his bedroom as Sharon sleeps, closes the door softly,
and sits on the side of the bed.]

RANDY
...I'm not gonna go.

SHARON
What?

RANDY
Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm
not gonna go.

SHARON
Why?

RANDY
I just... don't think I can, all right?


SHARON
You don't think you can?! This is the
biggest game of your son's life! Wny
wouldn't you go and support him? What-?


RANDY
Because I'm scared, all right?!  You
wanna break me down?! You wanna hear
me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know
if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't
know if I can take this guy, Sharon.


SHARON
So then, don't. You don't have to get
in fights with other parents at Little
League games! Just sit there and watch!


RANDY
Look, I get what you're trying to do.
You're trying to get me to realize that
I have to fight him because it's who
I am.

SHARON
No, I'm telling you you don't have to
get thrown out of games and make an
ass of yourself.

RANDY
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon.
But you have to take Stan to his Little
League game alone.

[Coors Field, day]

ANNOUNCER
Welcoem to the Colorado Little League
State Championship Game!  This must
be pretty exciting for these youngsters.
A chance to go to the national circuit.


DENVER PITCHER
You know what these guys look like to
me? A bunch of winners!

DENVER CATCHER
Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!


CARTMAN
I don't think so! You guys are way too
good! You're the best at this game!


DENVER PITCHER
You're the best!

KYLE
You guys are so good you'll probably
go all the way to win the national title!


DENVER PITCHER
Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose
to you right now!

BAT DAD
Here we go, Denver! These South Park
kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!


WOMAN
Chris, will you sit down?

ANNOUNCER
First up to bat for South Park, Kyle
Schwartz.

KYLE 1
Where do I stand?

UMPIRE
R-right over here.

KYLE 1
Don't throw the ball too fast, because
I might get startled and I have asthma.


UMPIRE
Strike 1!

SP TEAM
Yeah! All right!

KYLE 1
Jesus, not so close! That was three
feet from hitting me in the head!


SECOND BASEMAN
He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!


KYLE 1
Oh Jesus!

UMPIRE
Strike 2!

SP TEAM
Yeah!

STAN
Wow, he IS great at sucking.

CARTMAN
We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!


KYLE 1
Don't throw it so hard or so close next
time! Is it cold out here? I think I
need a jacket.

UMPIRE
It's a bunt!

MR. DONOVAN
Run kid, run!

KYLE 1
Oh Jesus!

KYLE
Aw crap!

KYLE 1
I can't, I can't keep running like
this! I have corns in my feet!

STEVEN
Keep running, kid!

BAT DAD
Throw the ball to third, you idiots!
He's runnin' home!

UMPIRE
Safe!

KYLE 1
Oh Jesus, did you see that?? I hit a
homerun! High-five, everybody!

KYLE
Oh my God... their pitcher was able
to hit him right on the bat.

STAN
Dude, we had it all wrong. While we
spent all our time trying to make our
tean suck, these guys practiced and
got really good at sucking.

TOKEN
No!

MR. WILLIAMS
Yeeaahh! Go Token go!

[Denver is up to bat]

BAT DAD
All right, Denver! You're up to bat
now!

UMPIRE
Out!

DENVER TEAM
Yaaay!

KYLE
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves
out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have
to play this boring game all summer
long.

BUTTERS
Son of a biscuit!

[Coors field, later]

ANNOUNCER
It's the bottom of the last inning here
at Coors Field; the score is South Park
23, Denver 0.

UMPIRE
Strike 1!

BAT DAD
Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do
not cross the Bat Daaad!

KYLE'S FATHER
Geez I realy wish this guy would shut
up.

BAT DAD
Why don't you just go home, South Park?
You can't beat Denver!

A VOICE
Denver sucks ass!  Come on, South Park!
These kids can't play! In fact, these
kids are terrible!

UMPIRE
Strike 2!

KYLE 1
Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never
won a sport before; this is so exciting.


RANDY
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped
your ass!

BAT DAD
You'd better shut your mouth before
I shut it for you!

RANDY
What do you wanna do, huh?

STAN
This can't get any worse.

BAT DAD
Now for the finishing move! You're
about to be Bat-Dadded!

COMMENTATOR
It all comes down to this! South Park
is just one pitch away from being State
Champions.  Oh geez, it looks like two
parents are fighting. They'd better
be careful. The Little League has a
no-tolerance policy.

UMPIRE
Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your
teams disqualified!

STAN
Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting!


UMPIRE 2
Break it up! Break it up!  That's enough!
The next person that fights is getting
his team disqualified!

BAT DAD
He's done for anyway.

CROWD

RANDY

UMPIRE 2
Stop, stop right now!  I'm warning you,

SP TEAM

SP ADULTS

COMMENTATOR

Trey Parker





[Cartman's house, morning. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek show up. Stan
rings the doorbell. Liane comes to the door]

LIANE
Oh, hello boys.

STAN
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we
all have to start going to class again.


LIANE
Oh, but I thought your teacher died.


KYLE
She did, but now they're saying we have
to start going back to school anyways.
It's totally gay.

LIANE
Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just
down in the basement playing with his
dolls.

TWEEK
Cartman likes to play with dolls?

[Cartman's basement. He's playing with a rubber lamb at the edge
of a hole in the basement.]

CARTMAN
Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good
Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from
the basket.

POLLY PRISSY PANTS
Oh please, mister. Please let me out
of here.

CARTMAN
It puts the lotion on its skin or else
it gets the hose again.

POODLE
Bark bark bark bark!

CARTMAN
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now
it puts the lotion back in the basket.


POLLY PRISSY PANTS
Please, mister, let me out.

CARTMAN
It puts the lotion back in the basket!


POLLY PRISSY PANTS
I miss my Mom, mister. I wanna see my
Mommy-

CARTMAN
Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!


LIANE
Sweetie.

CARTMAN
Yes Mom?

LIANE
You have to get ready for school

CARTMAN
...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?


LIANE
Yes, but they said two weeks off was
enough, and they want everyone back.


CARTMAN
Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over
our teacher's tragic death. I'm still
sh-shooken up.

LIANE
You'll get over it, honey.

CARTMAN
But I wanna plaaayyy.

[South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade. The kids pour into the
classroom, chattering. Wendy walks up and starts talking to Red
and Jordan]

WENDY
I can't believe it's been two weeks
since I've seen you guys. What have
you been doing?

BEBE
Hey guys.

WENDY
Hey Bebe.

BEBE
You guys uh,  notice anything different?


WENDY
Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs.

BEBE
Yeah, they started coming in last week.
At first I thought they were just mosquito
bites, but, then they didn't go away.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?
I know this has been a difficult couple
o'weeks for you all with the untimely
death of your teacher, but it's time
for us to try to move on and learn,
m'kay?

CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the
teacher's tragic death yet. I need more
time. It's just... it still hurts, you
know? Can I go home?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn
to hide our emotions with math problems.
M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication
tables over here, m'kay. First we'll
do uh, four time four, m'kay?

KYLE
Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems
different about her.

STAN
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get
a haircut or something?

KYLE
I don't know.

CLYDE
Hey Token. You know, I never noticed
before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda
cool.

TOKEN
I was just thinking the same thing.
It's like, she's a girl, but, she's
someone you could hang out with.

BUTTERS
Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh?

CARTMAN
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that
that Bebe chick always wears?

CRAIG
I don't know. Why?

CARTMAN
It just... it just seems like a really
awesome shirt.

CRAIG
Yeah. It kinda does.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me
the answer to the first problem, six
times eight? Uh, Bebe?

BEBE
:	 Oh, uh, forty-eight?

ALL THE BOYS
Whoa.

CLYDE
That is an awesome answer!

ALL THE BOYS
Yeah!

KYLE
Dude! Bebe is really smart!

STAN
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe
she's actually cool enough to hang out
with us.

CARTMAN
Yeah, may be.

WENDY
...And I was like, "I'm not buying those
shoes for twenty dollars."

STAN
Ah, hey, Bebe.

BEBE
Yeah?

STAN
Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars
later on, and we thought maybe you'd
like to join us.

BEBE
Really?  I've never done that before.


BUTTERS
Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these
little rocks at cars, and if the driver
gets angry, you blame me.

KYLE
Yeah, it's cool.

BEBE
Why sure, that sounds hellafun.

THE BOYS
Hahahahahaha...

KYLE
Yeah.

STAN
Hellafun

CARTMAN
Right, heh.

CLYDE
Wow, hellafun. That's awesome.

TOKEN
I'm gonna start saying that now.

STAN
Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.

WENDY
Stan, you've never asked me to throw
rocks at cars with you guys.

STAN
That's different, dude. You're like,
my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't
know. She's just cool.

KYLE
Yeah. She's really cool.

CLYDE
It's weird how we never noticed before.


[A hill just outside of town. The boys and Bebe are gathered
at the summit]

STAN
So what you do, see, is wait for a car
to drive by that big pine tree. Then
you chuck a rock at it. It's all about
the timing.

DRIVER
You damn kids!

BEBE
Cool.

CLYDE
You try it, Bebe.

BEBE
Okay.

TOKEN
Here comes a sedan.

DRIVER
You damn kids!

THE BOYS
Awesome!

BUTTERS
Cool!  That was the most perfect throw
I've ever seen.

KYLE
That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just
hold the rock like this, you-

CLYDE
Yeah.  Here, it's like if you put your
thumb on this side-

KYLE
I'm showing her.

CLYDE
Yeah, just let me show her real quick
how to put the thumb and-

KYLE
Hoh!

CLYDE
Hoh hoh hoh!

KYLE
Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it
by holding it here and-

STAN
Yeah, and then you can actually hold
it like this. Now-

KYLE
Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh!

STAN
Hoh hoh hoh!

KYLE
Hah hah hah!

CRAIG
Urh urh urh!

BEBE
Uh. Listen guys, un, It's five-thirty.
I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll
see you later.

STAN
...Wait, what were we doing again?


KYLE
We were throwing rocks at cars.

THE BOYS
Oh yeah.

CARTMAN
Woohoo.

BUTTERS
Uh here comes an SUV.

DRIVER
You damn kids!

[South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their seats.
Bebe is the last kid to enter class and find a seat]

THE BOYS
Hi, Bebe.

BEBE
Hey everybody.

WENDY
Oh, for Christ's sake!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a
paper to read aloud for the class. Now,
who want to start?  M'kay, class.


CLYDE
My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the
coolest person, ever."

STAN
Hey, that's what I wrote about!

BUTTERS
Me too!

CLYDE
Hoh!

STAN
Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead,
Clyde.

CLYDE
"My friend Bebe is really smart. She
tells funny jokes and knows a lot about
stuff. She's good at almost everything
she tries. She's awesome. The end."


COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token,
why don't you read your paper?

TOKEN
"If I could be Bebe."  "If I was Bebe
I would have lots of friends because
I would be sooo great. I would make
people smile and think wherever I went."


COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, interesting, Token, Uh... Who
would like to go next?  Uh how about
someone who didn't write about how cool
Bebe is?

THE BOYS
Oh.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, Bebe?

BEBE
"My cat Thumper."

THE BOYS
Wwooww.

BEBE
"Thumper is gray with a white spot.
Sometimes he likes to chase his tail.


CLYDE
Chase his tail? That must be so funny?


BEBE
"Thumper is twelve years old. That's
pretty old for a cat. The end."

THE BOYS
Wwooww!

CARTMAN
God, you know what, that's so true?
Because, you sometimes never really
think about how old a pet is until it's
gone.

CRAIG
That's true, huh? Man, that makes me
really reflect on my pet.

STAN
That's such a great paper!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your
paper?

WENDY
"The new Cold War"

CARTMAN
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert!


[South Park Elementary cafeteria. Wendy is talking to Red and
two other girls]

WENDY
But, then the mall closes at four or
five o'clock, so who knows w-

CLYDE
Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe
anywhere?

WENDY
No!

KYLE
Maybe she's in the lunch line.

THE BOYS
Yeah.

WENDY
Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's
so cool all of a sudden.

GIRL 1
I can't stand her anymore! She's such
a slut!

GIRL 2
She's a total slut!

RED
You know what I heard? I heard that
she made out with eight different boys
in one minute.

GIRL 1
I heard that she lifted her shirt to
the boys at the bus stop.

WENDY
I heard that her asshole is this big
around.

GIRLS 1 AND 2
Wwooww.

BEBE
Hey guys.

WENDY
Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut.

GIRL 1
Slut.

GIRL 2
Slut.

GIRL 1
Slut.

BEBE
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating
after school?

WENDY
Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might
trip and then we'd be sucked into your
huge gaping vagina like ants into a
vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.

GIRL 1
Slut.

GIRL 2
Slut.

RED
Slut.

WENDY
Slut.

GIRL 1
Slut.

GIRLS
Whore. Slut. Slut.

[Bebe's house, after school. She's looking out over the neighborhood
from her bedroom window. Her mother stops by her door and looks
in]

BEBE'S MOM
Bebe, is something the matter?

BEBE
Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends
at school said some really mean things
to me today.  They called me a slut,
with a huge gaping vagina.

BEBE'S MOM
Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing
up.  Part of being a woman is having
a friend one day and calling her a slut
the next.

BEBE
But am I slutty just because I'm beginning
to be friends with guys? I mean, they
just like me because they think I'm
smart and cool.

BEBE
I remember when I was a little girl
the boys didn't think I was very smart
at all. But then one day, they all started
thinking I was really smart. I guess
big smarts just run in our family.


BEBE
Well if the girls don't wanna be my
friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler,
anyways.

[King Jimmy's Buffet, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit at a
booth eating hamburgers and some side dishes]

TWEEK
You... guys wanted me to meet you here?


CARTMAN
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need
to have a talk

TWEEK
Oh God.

CARTMAN
Alright guys, now that we're all here,
I think... we need to have a difficult
conversation. It's obvious that Bebe
is the like the coolest, smartest, most
awesome person we've ever met.

STAN, KYLE
True.

STAN
Yeah.

KYLE
Yep.

CARTMAN
And, you know, we've been trying to
fill the gap for the fourth friend ever
since Kenny died, God rest his soul,
and it hasn't been an easy process.


KYLE
Right.

STAN
Uh huh.

CARTMAN
And so, even though I think it's a tough
thing to do right now, I think maybe
it's best for everyone if we make room
to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.


KYLE
Yeah.

STAN
That would be best.

CARTMAN
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And
so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's
been really great, and we're gonna miss
you.

KYLE
Huh??

STAN
Kyle??

CARTMAN
And even though it didn't quite work
out, I'm sure you'll find other friends
down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch
for you, and some peanuts.

KYLE
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the
beginning!

CARTMAN
And we're really sad to see you go.
Let's give a big round of applause for
Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.

STAN
Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!

CARTMAN
Pleeeeease???

STAN
No!

CARTMAN
Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we
have no choice but to let you go, Tweek.
But we want you to know that its been
really fun. Here's a watch, and some
peanuts.

KYLE
No way! Tweek's cool!

STAN
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make
room for Bebe!?

[Bus stop, next day. The answer is shown. Bebe stands between
Kyle and Tweek, and Cartman is not present.]

BEBE
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus
to school with you guys.

STAN
Sure thing, Bebe.

CARTMAN
That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you,
Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you,
Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool.


[South Park Elementary, hallway. Some boys - Clyde, Butters,
Token, Craig, and Pip - are putting up a large poster that reads
"Bebe for President" next to the counselor's office. Wendy passes
by and stops to look]

WENDY
What are you doing?!

CLYDE
We're tryin' to get Bebe to run for
class president.

WENDY
I'm class president! The vote was last
fall!

CRAIG
Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit,
Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized
than you.

TOKEN
Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She
can teach us all so much.

THE OTHER BOYS
Uh huh.

WENDY
She's not smarter and cooler than everyone,
you guys are just drawn to something
else!

CLYDE
What?

WENDY
Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid!


BUTTERS
Stupider than Bebe!

CLYDE
Yeah!

CRAIG
Yeah!

BUTTERS
Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?


CLYDE
Yeah!

BUTTERS
Yeah!

CRAIG
Sure is!

BUTTERS
Uhyep.

[The neighborhood, after school. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek walk towards
Bebe's house]

KYLE
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip
with Bebe.

STAN
Yeah.  Where are you guys going?

BOY 1
We're going to see our friend Bebe.


STAN
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get
the memo?

BOY 2
Bebe is everybody's friend.

KEVIN
Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich
everyone's lives.

STAN
Hoh!

KYLE
Hoh hoh hoh!

KEVIN
Arf arf!

BOY 2
Arf!

TIMMY
Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!

STAN
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch
Terrance & Phillip together.

BEBE'S MOM
Oh, hello, boys.

STAN
Is Bebe home?

BEBE'S MOM
No, she's with one of her little friends.
But she should be back shortly if you
boys wanna wait.

BOY 1
Who is she with?

BEBE'S MOM
I believe she is playing "Lambs" over
at Eric Cartman's house.

STAN
Cartman's?

[Cartman's basement. He's at his hole again, and Bebe is sitting
next to him. He has his basket, lotion, and rubber poodle ready
to go]

CARTMAN
And this is Precious.

BEBE
Precious?

CARTMAN
Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put
my mom's hand lotion in this little
basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy
Pants.

BEBE
Uh huh.

CARTMAN
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on
its skin or else it gets the hose again."


BEBE
It puts the lotion on its skin or else
it gets the hose again.

CARTMAN
Heheh, yeah.

POLLY PRISSY PANTS
Mister, please let me out of here.


CARTMAN
Now say it again, louder.

BEBE
It puts the lotion on its skin or else
it gets the hose again.

CARTMAN
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in
the basket!

POLLY PRISSY PANTS
My parents have money, Mister. They'll
give you whatever you want. Please!


CARTMAN
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the
fucking basket!"

BEBE
Put the lotion in the basket!

CARTMAN
Put the lotion in the fucking basket!
Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog,
Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill
it!  Now you say, "Don't you hurt my
fuckin' dog!"

BEBE
Don't you hurt my fucking dog!

CARTMAN
You bitch, I'll cut your throat if-


KYLE
What the hell are you doing?

CARTMAN
We're playing "Lambs."

KYLE
Bebe, I thought we were going to watch
Terrance & Phillip today.

BUTTERS
Then we gotta work on your campaign.


BOY 2
Right, but first we gotta go to the-


STAN
Hoh!

BEBE
You guys, calm down!

[Token tackles Boy 1, Craig attacks Butters, Cartman punches
Boy 2, Kyle attacks Kevin, Pip beats on Tweek, Boy 1 chases after
Token, Boy 2 tosses Cartman over his head. Stan goes after Pip,
but Pip attacks first. Clyde goes after Tweek and sends him flying
across the basement. Token brings out a SuperBESTFriends lunchbox
and throws it at Clyde. Clyde jumps out of the way and the lunchbox
hits Timmy]

TIMMY
Timmih!

[Clyde attacks Token, but Token punches him away, then jumps
on him. Timmy runs over both of them. Token jumps up and goes
after Boy 1 again. Pip and Tweek fight again, and Stan comes
flying in, taking Pip]

BEBE
This is insane!

[Cartman picks Tweek up and throws him off. Boy 2 comes flying
at Bebe, back first. Bebe steps aside, and Boy 2 strikes the
wall]

BEBE
Stop it you guys, please!

[The map behind Bebe falls to the floor. Stan gets up, and Pip
flies at him. Cartman and Boy 1 fight again. Kyle swings in from
above on a hanging overhead light, landing on Cartman's back
as Cartman fight Tweek. Tweek drops away, and Cartman has to
wrestle Kyle. Boy 1 throws Token into a fossil display case,
and a femur falls out. Stan walks up and looks at Token, then
sees the femur. He picks it up and sees victory at hand. He starts
beating everyone with the bone. He hits Clyde twice with it,
and Clyde goes down. He then knocks out Kevin, then Cartman,
then Kyle, then goes after the other boys]

BEBE
Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this
trouble.

STAN
Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh!

[Bebe's house, day. She's at her window again, looking at the
neighborhood. The boys are all over her front lawn milling around]


BEBE'S MOM
Bebe, those boys from your school are
still waiting outside to see if you'll
come out.

BEBE
I know. They've been there all day.


STAN
Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!

CRAIG
Hah hah hahah hah!

STAN
Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!

BEBE'S MOM
Looks like my little girl has a lot
of gentlemen callers.

BEBE
Mom, why is everyone acting so different
around me?

BEBE'S MOM
Sweetie, you're just blossoming into
a woman.

BEBE
But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes
I think I'm not as smart and cool as
they say, that everyone just tells me
I am because of my hooters.

BEBE'S MOM
Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens
women are always told they're really,
really smart.

BEBE
Mom?  What's six times eight?

MRS. STEVENS
Oho, sweetie, those are two completely
different numbers.  Alright boys, time
to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling
well and she she can't come out today.
Go one, shoo.

STAN
Hoh. Hoh?

ASTRONAUT 1
Aah. We made it.

ASTRONAUT 2
Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us?

ASTRONAUT 1
Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands
of years in the future and apes have
taken over!

ASTRONAUT 2
I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!


ASTRONAUT 1
I don't want to live in this futuristic
madness!

ASTRONAUT 2
Take your ape rule and go to hell!


BEBE
Having boobs sucks.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, later. A man walks in and goes to his
desk]

A DOCTOR
Well hello there, little girl. My name
is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you
today?

BEBE
I wanna have breast-reduction surgery.


DR. HALLIS
You?

BEBE
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars
in nickels and a gold bracelet.

DR. HALLIS
Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we
don't offer breast reduction surgery
to girls of your age.

BEBE
Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones
when she was a teenager. Why can't I
have mine taken off?

DR. HALLIS
Because making breasts larger is a beautiful
and wonderful thing. Making them smaller
is... insane.

BEBE
I think it's insane to want them bigger.


DR. HALLIS
Why do you... hate your breasts so?


BEBE
Ever since I got these stupid things
everyone treats me differently. I feel
like I might be treated differently
the rest of my life.

DR. HALLIS
Oh, come on now, that's just silly.


BLONDE NURSE
Here's the Anderson file, Doctor.


DR. HALLIS
Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian.
That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you
so much.

BRUNETTE NURSE
And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor.


DR. HALLIS
Yeah, whatever. Get out of here.  Now,
I was saying?

BEBE
Please, you have to help me. I think
that if my breasts keep growing this
way, boys will give me whatever I want.


DR. HALLIS
Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?

BEBE
No it's not, because if I grow up getting
everything I want, having things made
easy for me because I have hot knockers,
then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame
person. If I'm handed everything in
life, then my chances of becoming a
lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.


DR. HALLIS
That may be true, but I'm afraid I just
cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction
surgery on an eight-year-old girl.


BEBE
Damnit!

DR. HALLIS
If, on the other hand, you'd like to
make them a little bigger, I think now
might be the right time to size up,
hm?

BEBE
Oh, fuck off!

[Stan's house, day. In the dining room Randy reads the paper.
Sharon enters.]

SHARON
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?


RANDY
Why? What's the matter with him?

SHARON
It's just that, well, he's been acting
a little different lately.

STAN
Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.

SHARON
He's been ignoring his homework, and,
all of his friends. I can't figure out
why.

STAN
Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.

RANDY
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to
notice breasts.

SHARON
Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting
to become a man.

STAN
Ahta. Ah, ahta!

RANDY
Hey there, son.

STAN
Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.

RANDY
Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.


STAN
Ahah

RANDY
Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these
"ahta" will start becoming a major part
of your life.

STAN
Ahta?

RANDY
But Stanley, you can't let them get
in the way of your friends. There are
a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're
just boobs; your friends... are forever.


STAN
Friend. Ahta.

RANDY
I know you think this set of boobs is
important now, but those boobs will
be replaced by another set of boobs.
Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,
you'll meet a pair of boobs that you
want to marry. And those become the
boobs that matter the most.

SHARON
I love you.

RANDY
If you can just understand that, Stanley,
you'll see that boobs hold no real power
at all.

[Bebe's house, night. The house is dark, so she's asleep. The
camera zooms in on her, and her breasts start to blink under
her gown]

RIGHT BREAST
The boys are at war. All is going as
planned.

LEFT BREAST
Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought
to their knees.

RIGHT BREAST
We grow larger every day.

LEFT BREAST
And stronger.

RIGHT BREAST
Soon the entire tow-

LEFT BREAST
Sh! Sh! She's awake!

RIGHT BREAST
Ah, quiet.

BEBE
MOM!! MOM!!

MRS. STEVENS
What is it, Bebe?

BEBE
My breasts!

MRS. STEVENS
Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming
a young lady.

BEBE
No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were
talking! They wanna destroy the town!


MRS. STEVENS
Yes, darling, your breasts have a power
that will unleash itself as you get
older. They feed off the misery of boys
and grow to bring woe wherever they
can. You're blossoming into a woman.


BEBE
That does it! I'm NOT letting these
things run my life!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Hallis walks in with a file and
quickly addresses his prospective client]

DR. HALLIS
Young lady, are you absolutely sure
you want to consider this kind of procedure
for your breasts?

WENDY
Yes! I want to get breast implants!


MRS. TESTABURGER
I tried to tell her she was too young.


DR. HALLIS
Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger.
Society puts a lot of pressure on your
daughter to look her best. Having small
breasts can make her feel unimportant.


MRS. TESTABURGER
But she's eight!

DR. HALLIS
Yes, well, not too young to feel flat
and therefore, not pretty.

WENDY
That's what I said.

DR. HALLIS
However, young lady, I'm afraid breast
implants are not for everyone.  I'll
need to carefully assess your physical
and mental condition to see if augmentation
is truly the best way for you to go.


WENDY
I have three thousand dollars, cash.


DR. HALLIS
You pass. Let's do this thing.

MRS. TESTABURGER
Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right
now?

DR. HALLIS
Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a
very simple procedure.  What we do is
make a small incision in the armpit
where it won't be seen. Then we take
this little plastic bag and gently place
it in the chest where we fill it with
salt water.

MRS. TESTABURGER
I still don't know about this.

DR. HALLIS
Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy.
If we can help someone's self-esteem
a little, then why not do it if they
have to be a thousand dollars?

[Operating room, moments later. Wendy is hooked up and sedated.
The first incision is made to the left armpit and the flesh pulled
back hard. The nurse hands the doctor the first implant, which
he shoves in Wendy's chest]

DR. HALLIS
Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get!
In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In!
There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's
one, Wendy. Doing great.

[South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Mackey is back teaching the
class. The kids are at their seats]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your
failing grades.

CLYDE
Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, we all need to start studying
more and fighting less, m'kay?

A BOY
Bebe!

STAN
Ahta!

BEBE
Hey guys.

CRAIG
Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't
as cool as she used to be?

TOKEN
Yeah. What the hell happened to us?


STAN
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's
boobs.

CARTMAN
Bebe's boobs?

BEBE
Oh cool! It worked!

STAN
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something
to our brains. They fill our brains
with illusions.

KYLE
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart
and cool? It was just her boobs?

BEBE
Yes!

CARTMAN
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as
she ever was?

BEBE
Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.


KYLE
But that sucks. I don't want something
to have that much power over me.

STAN
I don't think it will, you guys, as
long as we realize it. We must learn
to control their power over us.

CLYDE
Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!


CRAIG
I'm sorry for fighting, you guys.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?

CLYDE
Let's never let boobs come between us
again!

THE BOYS
Hear Hear!

KYLE
Boobs are stupid!

WENDY
Hi, everybody.

CLYDE
Look at those ridiculous things!

BUTTERS
Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!


CARTMAN
What a stupid bitch!

"KENNY DIES"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Unplanned Parenthood, day. It has undergone renovation, so it
looks softer. It's snowing outside]

[Inside, operating room. A woman is waiting on a hospital bed.
She's quite pregnant. A doctor enters the room with a cart housing
everything he needs for his work, and approaches the bed]

DOCTOR
Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for
your abortion?

MS. SANDERS
Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess.


DOCTOR
Well, try to relax; It will all be over
very soon.

MS. SANDERS
Docter, can we turn off that television?


DOCTOR
Oh yes, I 'm sorry.

Now, there is one more thing.

MS. SANDERS
What?

DOCTOR
Have you heard of stem-cell research?


MS. SANDERS
Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but...
I don't know what it is.

DOCTOR
Well basically, a lot of amazing studies
have shown that stem cells might be
used to fight cancer and a myriad of
other diseases. Right now, a lot of
stem cells come from the tissue of aborted
fetuses-  ah I'm sorry, unwanted children.
And if you sign a release, that tissue
can go to studies

MS. SANDERS
Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.


DOCTOR
The hope is that someday it might.


MS. SANDERS
Well okay.

DOCTOR
Great.  Well, here we go.

[Hallway outside operating room. The sounds of abortion are heard,
but the operation itself isn't seen. A janitor passes by with
a vacuuum cleaner. The OR door opens and the doctor steps out
with a small container]

DOCTOR
Nurse?  This is to go to Alder's Labs
for stem-cell research.

NURSE
Yes, Doctor.

[The highway, moments later. The truck rolls along to "On The
Road Again." and the driver joins in the singing]

TRUCK DRIVER
...going places that I've never been


Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh! [a deer leaps into
the read ahead of him and looks at him] Jesus Christ!! [swerves
to avoid the deer and goes over a cliff, tumbling down its side.
It lands somewhere below with its contents spilled all over the
place. The driver is killed on impact, but the song continues
to play...]

[The highway, moments later. A Big Wheel rounds a corner...]


CARTMAN
My baby takes the morning train and
she takes another home again. Hmm.
What do we have heah?

[A cow pasture, later. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sit among the cows
burning cow dung. Kenny holds the match and lighter. The cows
around them are grazing]

STAN
Well that burned a long time.

KYLE
Yeah, that was pretty good.

STAN
Oh dude, there goes one.

KYLE
'K go!

STAN, KYLE
Alright!

KENNY
(That's awesome)

KYLE
You've had that cough a while, Kenny.
You okay?

KENNY
(All right. I'm fine.)

BUTTERS
Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!

STAN
What, Butters?

BUTTERS
Eric says you gotta come to his house
right away.

STAN
Tell him we're busy.

BUTTERS
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that,
so, he told me to tell you that you
don't wanna miss this.

KYLE
What, did he lose a hundred pounds?


BUTTERS
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too,
so he said t'say, ah, up your ass, Jew.
Yeah.

STAN
Alright, let's go see what he wants.


BUTTERS
Oh, it's all sticky.

[Cartman's house, minutes later. The three other boys approach
him in the living room. Cartman can barely contain his glee.]


KYLE
Alright, Cartman! What's so important
you had to pull us away from lighting
cow crap on fire?!

CARTMAN
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe
it!

STAN
What?

CARTMAN
Guess what I have sitting in my back
yard?

KYLE
A trampoline?

CARTMAN
Better.

STAN
A boat?

CARTMAN
Better.

KENNY
(A football machine?)

CARTMAN
Better.

STAN
Well WHAT, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.


KYLE
...What?

CARTMAN
Mint condition, tax free.

STAN
Cartman, what the hell are you doing
with aborted fetuses?!

KYLE
I'm leaving right now!

CARTMAN
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news,
Kyle!

KYLE
You've never watched the news, fatass!
And what the hell does that have to
do with anything?!

CARTMAN
Stem cells, numbnuts!

STAN
Stem cells?

KYLE
Oh, and what do you know about stem
cells?!

KENNY
(What the fuck are stem cells?)

KYLE
They're cells that come from fetuses,
and some research show that they could
be used to treat diseases.

CARTMAN
It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on
3-2-1 Contact. With all the research
that's going on, stem cells are worth
three times their weight in gold. What
I have in my back yard is an aborted
treasure chest.

KYLE
...I hate you so much.

CARTMAN
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can
sell these fetuses all on my own!


[Cartman's house, later. He's up in his room placing cold calls
to business he finds in the Yellow Pages.]

CARTMAN
Hello. Is this theee University of Colorado
Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand
you're corrently doing research on stem
cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in
possession of somesah aborted fetuses
that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how
much do you pay? ...No, no, come on,
ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty
dollars a pound right now. ...How about
a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my
balls- I, I'll think about it.

[later]

Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem
cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've
been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses,
Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company
give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here.
...You're breaking my balls, Randy.

[later]

Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses
for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah,
I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck.
I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna
talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other?
Breakin' my balls, Chuck.

[later]

I gotta unload these fetuses, you wannan do some research. Are
we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling
you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal
mistake. [suddenly grins and covers the receiver with his right
hand] That's a joke [removes his hand from the receiver] ...A
hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.
[hangs up and relaxes, putting his feet up on his desk and his
hands behind his head] Damn I'm good.

[Alder Research Group, some days later. Cartman enters, hauling
the thirty-three aborted fetuses behind him in a wagon. Workers
around the lab move stuff around]

RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?

CARTMAN
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these
fetuses hyam?

RECEPTIONIST
Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very
lucky you called. Our last shipment
of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.


CARTMAN
Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do
I talk to about payment?

RESEARCHER
This is awful, just awful!

RECEPTIONIST
Oh Larry! This young man has some new
fetuses for research.

CARTMAN
You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry.
They're top notch

LARRY
Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy
those from you now.

CARTMAN
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought
them all the way down here already!


LARRY
I'm afraid the government has just put
a ban on stem-cell research.

RECEPTIONIST
A ban? Why?

LARRY
Too many people were upset about using
aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's
too bad, too. We really coulda helped
a lot of people.

CARTMAN
Ay! What the hell am I supposed to
do with these things, huh?! God-damnit!


[South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are filling their
seats. Stan and Kyle enter the classroom]

STAN
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny
are ditching school again.

KYLE
Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, class, let's take our seats.
Now, uh, before we get started, Stan
and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to
see you in her office.

STAN
The principal? Aw, come on!

KYLE
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms.
Choksondik!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
She needs to see you now!

KYLE
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew
as a scapegoat.

[Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Stan and Kyle enter
expecting the usual lecture, but are surprised to see their parents
on either side of Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Hello, boys.

STAN
Wait. What's going on here?

KYLE
Alright, we don't know for sure why
Cartman is ditching school, but it has
something to do with abortion. That's
all we know.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
You didn't do anything wrong boys.
We just need to talk to you. Have a
seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend
Kenny went to the hospital last night,
m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick.


KYLE
Kenny's sick?

STAN
Well how sick?

CHEF
Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with
a... terminal disease.

STAN
...but... the doctors are gonna make
him better, right?

SHARON
Oh dear.

STAN
Mom? That's what hospitals are for.
They, they can make him better.

SHARON
Randy...

RANDY
They don't think so, Stanley. Your...
your friend is terminally ill, and that
means.. Well son,... th that means he's
going to be going to heaven soon.


KYLE
Wait. Kenny's going to die?

KYLE'S FATHER
...He might, Kyle.

STAN
...But... he's our... fu... fufu friend.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
We know, and that's why he's going to
need you boys to be strong for him,
m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.


STAN
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die!
Kenny can't die!!

[Cartman's hosue, day. He's upstairs in his room placing cold
calls anew.]

CARTMAN
Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to
offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize
there's a ban on stem-cell research,
but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses
in my backyard! I'm sure there's other
research your company can do with them.
...You'll take one? Okay, how much for
one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my
balls here, Jack.

[later. There are now thirty-one]

Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah,
hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent
shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary,
your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you
payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary.
How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright,
I'll call you back. [hangs up and sighs deeply]

LIANE
Sweetie, your friends are downstairs.
They need to see you.

CARTMAN
Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three
feti; I've gotta sell the rest before
they spoil.

LIANE
They say it's an emergency.

CARTMAN
Buh, alright.  eh Butters?

BUTTERS
Uhyeah?

CARTMAN
Are you through databasing the clientele
sheet?

BUTTERS
Eh just about.

CARTMAN
Alright, well, you gotta take over
the telemarketing for a bit.

BUTTERS
Oh. Well, uhokay.

CARTMAN
Just remember what I taught you and
follow protocol. Next number to try
is on the list.

BUTTERS
Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson
with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello
sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn
fetuses that we think you can use for
a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how
much do you pay for that? ...You're
breaking my balls. ...I said, you're
breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My,
my balls.

[Living room, moments later. Cartman reaches the foot of the
stairs.]

CARTMAN
What is this, a PTA meeting?

KYLE
Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.


CARTMAN
In the ...hospital? Why?

KYLE
They told us he has a m-muscular disease.
An and, that ...and that he, he might
die.

CARTMAN
Die? Kenny?

STAN
Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna
die!

KYLE'S MOTHER
I'm going to go take the guys to go
see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought
you might wanna come.

CARTMAN
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Kenny lies in a bed in a patient
room with an IV unit attached]

DOCTOR
There we go, little buddy.

KENNY
(Thank you, Doc.)

DOCTOR
You sure you don't wanna take your jacket
off; it's pretty warm.

KENNY
(I'm all right)

NURSE
Hey, look who has some visitors.

DOCTOR
Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll
be right outside if you need us, Kenny.


KYLE
Hey dude, how's it going?

KENNY
(I'm okay, I guess.)

CARTMAN
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.


KYLE
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is,
dude.

CARTMAN
Heh, sorry.

KYLE
Hey, uhwe were all just talkin' about
how when you get better, we're all gonna
go down to Stark's Pond again and go
camping. Huh, Stan?

STAN
I-

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, outside. Stan rushes out the front
door, Kyle pursuing]

KYLE
Stan?  Stan, where are you going?


STAN
I can't, I just can't.

KYLE
Dude, he needs us right now.

STAN
I can't see him like that, Kyle. All
those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude.
He's s'posed to be running around and
laughing.

KYLE
I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me!
I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But
we have to be tough right now!

STAN
And what are we supposed to do, huh?!
Stand in that room and keep making small
talk?! Make believe like everything's
okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!

KYLE
Look, however hard you think it for
you, it's a lot harder for him!

STAN
Just leave me alone!

KYLE
Stan, you can't leave!

STAN
I'm not the one who's leaving, he is!


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Kenny's room. Cartman was left alone
with Kenny as Kyle went after Stan]

CARTMAN
...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan
and Kyle have always sort of two best
friends, you know, and... well I I don't
know if I ever told you this, Kenny,
but um... I kind of always thought you
were my best f-friend. I don't know.


KENNY
(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)


HURSE
Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny
some time to sleep now.

CARTMAN
Dont you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find
a cure for you. Everything's gonna be
okay!

[Hospital corridor, Hell's Pass Hospital. Cartman appears outside
the door with a long face, chokes up, and faces the wall to cry]


KYLE
Cartman?

CARTMAN
Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy?


KYLE
Cartman, were you... crying?

CARTMAN
No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin'
in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in
here is just uh.  Oh man.

KYLE
Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him,
too.

CARTMAN
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear
to God I'm gonna find a cure

KYLE
Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.


[Alder Research Group, next day. Inside, employees are packing
away their computers and other office equipment]

LARRY
This is where the bulk of our research
was being done. But due to the government
ban, we're mostly just packing things
up.

CARTMAN
Doctor, can you tell me exactly how
stem cells work?

LARRY
Look, you have trillions of cells in
your body: heart cells, skin cells,
brain cells, and so on. But before a
cell is designated as a toenail cell
or a pancreas cell, it's what we call
a stem cell. Sort of like a black cell.
Do you understand?

CARTMAN
Not at all, but go on.

LARRY
Because these cells are blanks, they
will often program themselves based
on what cells you put around them. You
see this rat? Earlier this year, we
surgically removed the middle of her
spine. then we injected her with some
stem cells and... they became the mising
part of the spine.

CARTMAN
My God...

LARRY
Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease
or heart tissue of cardiac patients
might ultimately be replaced by tissue
grown from stem cells.

CARTMAN
So then, could stem cells be used on
someone whose muscle tissue is wasting
away? Ihin other words, if a little
boy was dying from a muscular disease,
the stem cells could become new muscle
tissue.

LARRY
That's the theory.

CARTMAN
Well, so then, if the stem cells are
placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they
would become another Shakey's Pizza!
And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza
where you didn't have to charge yourself
to eat!

LARRY
Well, no. To build another Shake's it
would be better to use lumber.

CARTMAN
Hmmm.

LARRY
But, unfortunately, the government has
banned stem cell research and so...
we'll never know.

CARTMAN
Looks like someone is gonna have to
try and change the government's mind.


LARRY
Where are you going?

CARTMAN
There's a pretty brave kid fighting
for his life in the hospital right now,
doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger
boxing gloves.

LARRY
Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell.


CARTMAN
Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks.

LARRY
Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck.


CARTMAN
Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Kenny's room. The McCormicks, Kyle,
and Chef are present. Kyle has with him a bunch of get-well cards
from the other students in his class. The bed is seen from an
angle]

KYLE
...And see? Here's one from Butters.
It says, "We can't wait to see you back
in school, Kenny." And it has a picture
of him and you in a little airplane!


CHEF
Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots
of friends, don't you Kenny?

KENNY
(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)

KYLE
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing
here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna
come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.


KENNY
(I hope so)

NURSE
Hey, look who's here.

KENNY
(Stan??)

WOMAN
Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and
this is Bob Ferrin.

BOB
We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.


MS. MCCORMICK
Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?

KENNY
(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)

LAURA
We travel the country given special
little boys and girls like you their
biggest wish.

KYLE
Neat, huh Kenny?

KENNY
(Yes.)

LAURA
So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish,
what would it be?

BOB
What's your wish, pal?

KENNY
(I guess the only thing I wish is to
not die.)

LAURA
What did he say?

KYLE
He said his wish is not to die.

LAURA
...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna
have two wishes, what would the second
one be?

BOB
I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna,
huh?

KENNY
(No. Fuckin' Madonna...)

BOB
Wu what was that?

KYLE
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore
who wore out her welcome years ago,
and that now she suddenly speaks with
a British accent and she thinks she
can play guitar and she should go fuck
herself.

MADONNA
Should I come in now?

BOB
Uh no not quite yet.

[The cow pasture, day. Stan has come here to reflect on Kenny's
hospitalization. He sits on a log resting his head on his hands
and watches as a cow drops a load of dung next to the log. He
strikes a match and toses it on the dung. The dung lights up
and burns]

CHEF
Hello there, children.

STAN
Hey Chef.

CHEF
How's it goin'?

STAN
Bad.

CHEF
Yeah. Things have been better.

STAN
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why?
Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't
God take someone else's f-f-friend?


CHEF
Stan, sometimes God takes those closest
to us, because it makes him feel better
about himself. He is a very vengeful
God, Stan. He's all pissed off about
something we did thousands of years
ago. He just can't get over it, so he
doesn't care who he takes.Children,
puppies, it don't matter to him, so
long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.


STAN
But then, why does God give us anything
to start with?

CHEF
Well, look at it this way: if you want
to make a baby cry, first you give it
a lollipop. Then you take it away. If
you never give it a lollipop to begin
with, then it would have nothin' to
cry about. That's like God, who gives
us life and love and help just so that
he can tear it all away and make us
cry, so he can drink the sweet milk
of our tears. You see, it's our tears,
Stan, that give God his great power.


STAN
I thnk I understand.

[Capitol Hill, Washington DC]

CARTMAN
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in
Colorado. My best friend in the whole
world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's
sick right now. He's real sick. He's
only eight years old and his doctors
don't think he has very long to live.
Look, I realize that using the tissue
from aborted fetuses for research is
a touchy subject, but... All I know
is that if there's a chance, a... chance
that stem-cell research could save my
best friend's life, well... I guess
I owe it to him to try and change your
minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...
I want you to love him too.  And I
uh, I'm not the best speaker in the
world. Maybe I can put it best in the
words of a timeless song


It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant


The heat of the moment shone in your eyes


I never meant to be so bad to you

One thing I said that I would never do

CONGRESSMAN 1
One look from you and I would fall from
grace.

CONGRESSMAN 2
And that would wipe the smile right
from my face.

A FEW CONGRESSMEN
And incidents arose from circumstance?


EVERYONE
One thing led to another; we were young


And we would scream together songs unsung


It was the heat of the moment

Telling me what our hearts meant

The heat of the moment

shone in your eyes [Cartman raises his voice to the G above middle
C]

[Planned Parenthood, day. Cartman, in shirt and tie, is outside
with clipboard in hand, talking to a woman about to have an abortion.]


CARTMAN
And so you see, now that the ban on
stem-cell research has been lifted,
we can sell your fetus to compnaies
like Alder Labs.

WOMAN
Oh, I don't know.

CARTMAN
Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars
for that fetus right now, Jill.

JILL
Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.


CARTMAN
Great, just sign right here, please.
Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.
Listen, if you'd like to sell your
abortion for research I'm offering uh,
seventy-five dollars. Help you out a
little bit with your medical bill in
there.  And you sign right here.  Uh
excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you
in selling your aborted fetus?

WOMAN 2
We're not going to the abortion clinic.
I'm going to have this baby.

CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because
uh, there's a little boy dying in a
hospital right now who sure could use
that baby more than you could. The stem
cells from your fetus could help save
his life.

MAN
Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just
make another one.

WOMAN 2
Oh Mark, I love you.

CARTMAN
Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan enters with a package, his faith
renewed, his confidence strong, and makes his way down the hall,
passing people as he goes]

HEAD NURSE
Young man, do you know where you're
going?

STAN
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because
he needs me right now.

HEAD NURSE
All right!

MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Go kid!

MAN ON CRUTCHES
Good for you!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, Kenny's room. Stan enters happily]

STAN
Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.

KYLE
He just... He just... stopped breathing.
And it was over.

STAN
But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell
I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.
Did he say anything before he went?


KYLE
He just said... "Where's Stan?"

[First Church of South Park,some days later, day. The camera
looks up at some lights, then pans down as it back up to focus
on the altar]

MR. GARRISON
And so, we will all miss Kenny, his
playful laughter, his innocent smile.
But we will never forget that it was
because of brave Kenny that stem-cell
research was allowed to continue.


STAN
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.


CARTMAN
You guys! Come quick!

KYLE
What, Cartman

CARTMAN
It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys!


[Outside, day. Cartman stops, but still bounces from joy. Stan
and Kyle join him]

STAN
What, Cartman? What's happened?

CARTMAN
Look.  I put the stem cells from all
the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's,
and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's!
It worked!

STAN
This whole time, you were just using
Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem
cell research so you could sell your
stupid fetuses?

CARTMAN
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!


KYLE
I actually hugged you. I held you in
my arms and, and, cried with you.


CARTMAN
I think I only need a hundred or so
more aborted babies,  and I can finish
up the kitchen.

KYLE
AAARGH!

CARTMAN
Aah! Kyle!  Kyle!

STAN
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!
Cartman was!

Episode 104

"BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY BOATRIDE"

by

Matt Stone & Trey Parker



EXT. BUSSTOP - DAY

The boys are waiting for their bus.

KYLE
Hey, where's the school bus? We're
gonna be late for football practice.

A dog comes walking up to Stan wagging it's tail.

STAN
Hiya Sparky!

KYLE
Who's that?

STAN
That's my new dog, Sparky.
(Proudly)
He followed me to the busstop!

KYLE
Wow, cool!

STAN
Good boy, Sparky! Who's my best buddy?
Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?

CARTMAN
Ugh, you're making me sick, dude.

STAN
He's part Doberman, and part wolf!
He's the toughest dog on the mountain!

CARTMAN
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester
is the toughest dog in South Park!

WHIP PAN to a mangy mutt bull dog sitting on the curb that
looks ridiculously fierce and pissed off.

STAN
He's not meaner than Sparky!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah? Let's see... HEY SYLVESTER!

Sylvester angrily walks over to the boys. He and Sparky
immediately growl at each other.

STAN
Sparky'll kick his ass!

CARTMAN
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester!

KYLE
You're on, dude!

Sparky and the other dog circle each other. Finally Sparky
lunges!

STAN
That's it, Sparky kick his ass!

Sparky hops on top of the dog. We see only the top part of
Sparky and the boys' faces, which all look confused.

CARTMAN
Huh... He's doing something to his
ass. He's not kicking his ass, but
he's definitely doing something to
his ass.

STAN
Sparky?! Bad dog.

KENNY
Mphph rmph rm rmph!

STAN
WHAT?

CARTMAN
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay!

STAN
What do you mean?

CARTMAN
That dog is a gay homosexual.

STAN
(To the boys)
He's just confused.

KYLE
I think the OTHER dog's the one that's
confused.

KENNY
Mph rmph rmph!

STAN
Sick, shut up, dude!

Finally, Sylvester runs away yelping.

CARTMAN
(Singing)
Stan's dog's a homo! Stan's dog's a
homo!

Cartman is cut off by the big yellow bus entering frame.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

The large football field sits behind South Park Elementary.
The boys are all dressed in cute little football uniforms,
with "South Park Cows" on the jerseys and a cow's head on
the helmet.

CHEF
Okay children, I know that you're
all extremely excited, nervous and
anxious about the homecoming game
against Middle Park --

KYLE
Who's Middle Park?

CARTMAN
What's homecoming?

CHEF
-- But just remember what I taught
you: That football is like making
love to a really beautiful women;
You can't always score, but when you
do it makes all the trying worth
while.

The kids blink.

CHEF
Now let's start practice!

Chef blows his whistle and the kids put on their helmets and
walk to the field.

PIP
Ah, Mr. Chef, sir?

CHEF
Yes, Pip, what is it?

PIP
Well I still don't have a helmet.

CHEF
I know, Pip, the school can't afford
helmets for everybody.

PIP
Yes, but, couldn't we ROTATE who
doesn't have a helmet every week?
Does it always have to be me?

CHEF
Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.

PIP
Oh.

CHEF
Sorry, son, now get your ass in there.

Pip joins the other kids, who are in huddled positions at
the line of scrimmage.

Stan plays quaterback.

STAN
HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT!
HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT! HUT!

CHEF
HIKE THE DAMN BALL!!

Cartman snaps the ball, which goes flying past Stan.

The kids all yell and run around in circles. Kyle charges
Pip head first, smashing Pip's helmetless head open.

Chef rolls his eyes as Jimbo and Ned come walking up.

JIMBO
Hey, how's practice coming there,
Chef?

CHEF
Huh? Oh, fine, fine.

JIMBO
I don't have to remind you just how
important this game is to us South
Park alumni.

CHEF
Elementary school alumni?

JIMBO
That's as far as most of us got. You
think we have a shot at beating the
spread against Middle Park this year?

CHEF
I don't know? What's the spread?

JIMBO
Middle Park by seventy points.

CHEF
Hmmm...

Chef looks over at the kids who are running around in circles.
Cartman takes the ball and immediately falls over on top of
Kenny.

CHEF
I don't think we have a chance.

JIMBO
Nonsense, not with MY nephew at
quaterback! Right, Stanly?!

STAN
Huh?

Stan turns and gets smacked in the head with the football.
He falls down, but then quickly gets up, grabs the ball and
throws an incredible long bomb...

At the other end, Kyle catches the ball!

JIMBO
Atta boy!!

CHEF
Great pass, Stan!

JIMBO
C'mon, Ned, we gotta get our asses
to the bookie!

Jimbo and Ned dash off.

EXT. NEAR FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

The boys are all taking off their uniforms.

CHEF
Okay, that was a good practice
children, we'll see you here again
tomorrow.

KYLE
Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?

Stan looks to see that Sparky is prancing onto the playing
field.

STAN
Yeah, he must have followed me to
football practice. You see? He IS
smart!

KID (CLYDE)
Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football
practice all the time.

Little Rex just sits there. Sparky walks over to it.

STAN
Yeah, but MY dog found his own way
here! That makes him smarter than
your -- SPARKY get down!!

KID
OH MY GOD, WHAT IS HE DOING TO MY
DOG?!?!

CARTMAN
There he goes again!

STAN
GET DOWN SPARKY! DOWN!

CARTMAN
Stan forgot to mention that his dog
is a gay homosexual.

KID
Make him stop!!

Finally, Rex runs away, yelping with his tail between his
legs. All the other children start to laugh.

KID #2
Ha, ha! I'm sure glad MY dog isn't
gay!

KID #3
Yeah, maybe you should name your dog
SparkETTE Stan!

KID #2
Gay dog!

Stan looks at Sparky and sulks.

INT. CLASSROOM

Cartman is at the head of the class, giving what appears to
be a book report.

CARTMAN
And so you see, Simon and Simon were
not brothers in real life, only on
television.

MR. GARRISON
Thank you for that presentation,
Eric, but the assignment was on Asian
cultures. You get a D-.

CARTMAN
Aw, Dammit!

MR. GARRISON
Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?

MR. HAT
Well how about Stan, our little South
Park quarterback star?

MR. GARRISON
Oh, good idea. Okay, Stanly, you're
next.

Stan gets up.

STAN
Umm... I'm not really prepared either.

MR. GARRISON
Well, just make something up like
Eric did.

STAN
Okay... Uh... Asian culture has...
plagued our fragile Earth for many
years. We must end it --

MR. GARRISON
Excellent! A-.

CARTMAN
AY!

STAN
Wow, cool!

CARTMAN
Wait a minute! Why the hell does he
get an A-?!

MR. GARRISON
Eric, Stanly just might lead our
team to victory against the Middle
Park Cowboys for the first time in
decades, and we treat star athletes
better, because they're better people.

CARTMAN
That's not fair!

MR. HAT
Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to
it.

CARTMAN
(To himself)
Stupid puppet.

The school bell rings. The kids all start to get up.

MR. GARRISON (CONT'D)
Don't forget your assignments tonight,
children. They're due tomorrow for
everybody but Stan.

The kids all walk out, but Stan stays behind and walks up to
Garrison's desk.

STAN
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a
question?

MR. GARRISON
Of course Stanly, what is it?

STAN
What's a... homosexual?

Mr. Garrison's eyes get a little wide, he takes a deep breath.

MR. GARRISON
Oh... Well, Stanly, I guess you came
to the right person... Sit down.

Stan sits down, Mr. Garrison folds his hands.

MR. GARRISON
(Soft and calm)
Stanly... Gay people... Well, gay
people are evil. Evil right down to
their cold black hearts, which pump
not blood like yours and mine, but
rather a thick, vomitus oil that
oozes through their rotten veins and
clots in their pea sized brains which
becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque
patterns of violent behavior. Do you
understand?

STAN
I guess.

MR. GARRISON
Good, I'm glad we could have this
little talk, Stanly. Now you go
outside and practice football like a
good little heterosexual.

Stan blinks.

EXT. BUSSTOP

The boys get off the bus and head home.

CARTMAN
You see me block that defense today?
I was kicking ass.

KYLE
You're gonna need to kick more ass
than that to beat the Cowboys.

CARTMAN
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here
comes Stan's little homo dog.

STAN
Shut up, dude!

Sparky walks up wearing a pink scarf.

STAN
Sparky! Where'd you get that pink
scarf?!

Sparky wags his tail. Stan grabs the scarf, pulls it off and
tosses it away. Sparky barks extremely gayly.

SPARKY
(Feminine)
Bark, bark.

CARTMAN
Man, that is the gayest dog I have
ever seen.

STAN
He just needs some training, that's
all... Sit Sparky!

Sparky sits.

STAN
Good boy... Now, Shake...

Sparky gives Stan his paw.

STAN
Good boy... Now, DON'T BE GAY.

Sparky cocks his head to one side. Stan holds out a doggie
snack.

STAN
DON'T BE GAY, Spark. DON'T BE GAY.

Sparky frowns.

KYLE
Did it work?

STAN
I dunno.

CARTMAN
He still looks pretty gay to me.

Some of the other kids walk by.

KID
Hey Stan, your dog been to any pride
marches lately?

KID 2
Yeah, maybe you should take him to a
Barbara Streisand concert.

KID
Ha Ha Yea.

KID 2
Stupid little gay dog.

KID
Gay dog.

The mean kids walk away. Stan fumes.

STAN
Come on you guys, I have an idea!

EXT. SMALL WOODEN BUILDING

Jimbo and Ned walk up to the humble, small building and open
the door.

INT. SPORTS BAR

The interior is ridiculously huge. Like the sports book at
Ceasars Palace.

Ned and Jimbo walk up to the booking counter.

JIMBO
I want five hundred dollars on the
South Park Cows!

BOOKIE
Are you crazy?

JIMBO
No siree, I'm telling you I got the
line. My nephew Stan is the best
quarterback the school has ever seen.
I GUARANTEE they'll beat the spread!!

Suddenly, all the South Park residents go crazy placing bets
at the counter.

TOWNSPERSON 1
I'm gonna put all my money on the
Cows!

TOWNSPERSON 2
I'll put three hundred on the cows
if they guarantee it.

TOWNSPERSON 3
Hey I wanna put some money on the
cows too!

TOWNSPERSON 1
He guarantees it?

JIMBO
Uh -- Woa... Woa... Don't get TOO
carried away, now... I...

The place is an absolute frenzy, everyone in South Park is
betting their life savings.

TOWNSPERSON 3
You better be right about this, Jimbo.

JIMBO
(A little uneasy)
Huh, huh... yea, don't, don't worry
yourself.

NED
Are you sure Stan is that good?

JIMBO
(Quietly)
Not THAT sure... I think we better
come up with a back up plan... Uh
let's see. Hey Bookie, what's the
half time show gonna be?

BOOKIE
You haven't heard? John Stamos' older
brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing
'Loving You'.

NED
I love that song.

JIMBO
Loving You?? THAT'S PERFECT!!! Come
on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a
halftime show they'll never forget!

COMMERCIAL BREAK #1

EXT. STAN'S HOUSE - DAY

The boys and Sparky are standing next to a very large box.

STAN
Okay, Sparky, we got you a present.
Now, why don't.... Dammit Sparky,
where do you keep getting this thing?!

Stan pulls the pink bandana off of Sparky and again tosses
it away.

STAN
NO PINK BANDANA, SPARKY! BAD DOG!!

Sparky turns his head.

STAN
Now pay attention, Sparky...

Stan opens the box, and out walks a gorgeous white poodle,
with pink ribbons in her ears and a sparkling diamond collar.

STAN
This is Fifi.

Fifi struts around and shakes her rump.

KYLE
Ooh la la!

Sparky actually starts to look interested! Fifi walks in
front of him and Sparky slowly starts to follow her!

CARTMAN
There he goes!

STAN
Atta boy, Spark! Get her!

Sparky hops up on top of Fifi --

STAN
YES!!

-- Sparky grabs Fifi's diamond collar with his teeth, rips
it off, and throws it over his own head.

Stan looks incredibly disappointed as Sparky struts around
with his new jewelry.

STAN
AW CRAP!! Now what do I do?!

KYLE
Who cares if your dog is gay. Maybe
it's not that bad.

CARTMAN
No way, dude! My mom says God hates
gay people... That's why He smote
the sodomies in France.

KENNY
Mph rmphrm rmph rmph.

STAN
I know, Mr. Garrison said that
homosexuals are evil... But, but
Sparky doesn't seem evil.

KYLE
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong.
You should ask somebody else.

STAN
Like who?

INT. TELEVISION

NARRATOR
And now back to Jesus and Pals on
South Park public access.

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

Jesus sits at a desk with his hands folded.

JESUS
Yea, many of you are seeking answers.
And I am the way for you my children.
Let's open the phone lines back up
for some questions.

Jesus hits a button on the desk.

JESUS
Hello caller, you're on the air.

MAN
Yeah, is this Jesus?

JESUS
Yes my son.

MAN
This... this is Robert from Torrey
Pines. I called last week asking for
advice on my Ex-wife.

JESUS
Of course, Robert, how are things
now?

MAN
Everything's much better, Jesus, she
hasn't mouthed off since. I just
wanted to thank you for the advice.
Oh, and for dying for my sins, too.
That was really nice of you.

JESUS
Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller,
you're on the air.

STAN
Uh, hi, Jesus? I have a dog... And
he's... Uh... He's a homosexual.

JESUS
My son, a lot of people have wondered
what my stance on homosexuality is.
So I'd like to state once and for
all my true opinion. You see --

Suddenly, the image is replaced by a card that reads 'South
Park Public Access'.

NARRATOR
That's all the time we have left for
Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for
Marty's Movie Reviews!

INT. STAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Stan angrily hangs up the phone.

STAN
DAMMIT!

KYLE
What'd he say?

STAN
I got cut off for Marty's stupid
Movie Reviews!

CARTMAN
Oh Marty's Movie reviews are on?!
Kick ass!!

Cartman leaves.

STAN
ISN'T THERE ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP
ME?!?! ISN'T THERE ANYBODY WHO CARES?!

KYLE
Come on, dude, we have to get to
practice.

STAN
NO IT'S NOT OKAY!! I DON'T WANT A
GAY DOG!!!

EXT. STAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Sparky is standing in his little fenced yard. He looks up at
an open window in the house where he can hear Stan clearly.

STAN
I WANT A BUTCH DOG!! I WANT A RIN
TIN TIN!!

Sparky lowers his head sadly. He turns, digs a quick little
hole under the fence, and walks away.

Sparky looks back only once, then makes his way out into the
great unknown.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

CHEF
Now children, we've got to handle
the ball better.

The boys are all standing there holding footballs.

CHEF
You've got to hold your football
like you would hold your lover.

The boys just stand there.

CHEF
Gently, yet firmly.

The boys blink. Funky music kicks in.

CHEF
You want to be both nurturing and
clinging at the same time... Oh
yeah... just like making sweet love
to the football... Be naughty with
the football --

CHEF
(singing)
Spank it, ever so gently. Just..

KYLE
Ah chef,

CHEF
Spank it! Spank it!

KYLE
CHEF!!!

CHEF
Spank the football, Spank it.

KYLE
CHEF!!!!!

The music stops.

CHEF
Huh? Oh... Sorry, children... Let's
run some plays.

The kids head for the field.

PIP
Ah, Mr. Chef, sir?

CHEF
No, Pip we still don't have a helmet
for you.

PIP
Right-o... But how about I'll use a
helmet today, and one of the other
children goes without.

CHEF
That wouldn't be very fair to the
other children now would it.

PIP
Um, no... I guess not.

EXT. BOMBSMITHS

A small wooden building with a sign that reads 'Carl's' and
under that 'Bombs, Explosives, and Accessories'.

INT. BOMBSMITHS

Jimbo and Ned are sitting at a small table looking at a small
bomb.

JIMBO
What we want to do, Carl, is put a
trigger on that bomb that makes it
go off at a specific moment during
halftime.

CARL
And what moment would that be?

JIMBO
Well, John Stomos' older brother is
all set to sing 'Loving You' during
halftime. We want that bomb to go
off when he hits that high F.

CARL
What high F?

JIMBO
You know --

(SINGING)
Loving you, is easy 'cause you're
beautiful... Doot'n Doot'n Doo Doo
AAAAHHH!!!

CARL
So you want it to trigger on the
Doot'n Doo?

JIMBO
No damnit the AAAHHHH!!

CARL
(Hitting wrong note)
Aaahhhh?

NED
Ahhhhhh

JIMBO
AHHHHHH!

CARL
Ahhhhh

JIMBO
Doot'n doot'n doo doo. Ahhh

NED
Doot'n doot'n doo doo.

JIMBO
You got it.

CARL
Doot'n doot'n doo doo. Ahhhhh, Uh
yea okay.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Practice is over. The boys are taking off their uniforms.

CHEF
What's the matter, Stan? You seem
down.

STAN
I just can't concentrate, 'cause my
dog is gay.

CHEF
Well, you know what they say; you
can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, stop filling his head with that
queer loving propaganda.

CHEF
Say what? You of all people should
be sympathetic.

MR. GARRISON
What do you mean?

CHEF
Well you're gay aren't you?

MR. GARRISON
WHAT?! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?! I am not gay!

CHEF
Well you sure do act like it.

MR. GARRISON
I just act that way to get chicks,
dumbass.

Chef blinks.

KYLE
What's the matter, dude?

STAN
I don't know where Sparky is. He
usually follows me to football
practice.

CARTMAN
Maybe he went shopping for some
leather pants.

Stan slugs Cartman in the head.

CARTMAN
OW!!

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SOUTHPARK

All alone in a vast blizzard, Sparky trudges on. He walks
slowly and sadly.

He turns his head one way, and then another, uncertain where
to go.

Finally, he spots a large structure and walks towards it.

The sign slowly becomes visible. It reads "Big Gay Al's".

EXT. BIG AL'S

Sparky walks up to large wooden doors, from where a large
gay man emerges.

BIG GAY AL
Hello there, little pup. I'm Big Gay
Al.

Sparky looks around.

BIG GAY AL
Have you been outcast?

Sparky gives a little nod.

BIG GAY AL
Well then I'm so glad you found my
big gay animal sanctuary. We're all
big gay friends here. Would you like
to live with us?

Sparky seems to smile.

BIG GAY AL
Come on in, little fellow. Nobody
will ever oppress you here...

Sparky Follows Big Gay Al into the large wooden doors.

EXT. BUSSTOP - THE NEXT DAY

Stan walks up to the other boys.

STAN
Have you guys seen Sparky? He still
hasn't come back.

KYLE
Wow, it's been like two days.

STAN
I think he might have run away.

CARTMAN
Did you check the shopping mall?

Stan slugs Cartman in the head.

CARTMAN
OW!

KYLE
Well, we'll help you look for him
after the game.

STAN
I'm not playing.

KYLE
You what?

STAN
I'm not playing in that stupid game.
I have to find my dog.

Stan walks away.

EXT. MIDDLE PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Middle Park is a much nicer, larger school.

Jimbo and Ned quietly tiptoe around the exterior of the
school. Ned is carrying the bomb.

JIMBO
Come on, Ned, and keep quiet.

NED
Okay.

They walk up to a little fenced-in horse. A sign above it
reads 'Middle Park Cowboys Mascot - "Enrique"'.

JIMBO
Hello there, Enrique.

NED
What are we doing here?

JIMBO
Well, Ned, we always kidnap middle
park's mascot... But THIS year we're
gonna booby trap it instead!

Jimbo attaches the bomb to the horse.

JIMBO
And when John Stamos older brother
hits that high F in 'Loving You'
BOOM!! No more middle park players!!

Jimbo and Ned laugh. The horse looks extremely worried.

JIMBO
God damn I love football!

EXT. OUTSIDE OF SOUTH PARK

Stan walks along looking for Sparky.

STAN
Sparky! Where are you??!!

Stan stops and looks around.

STAN
Where could he be?!

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - FIGHT

Now a large crowd has gathered at the football field. The
Middle Park Cowboys, looking sharp in silver and blue uniforms
warm up for the game by doing stretches.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond
at South Park public radio AM 900,
welcome to tonight's match up between
the Middle Park Cowboys and the South
Park Cows. Well, looks like Chef,
the South Park Cows' coach is a little
nervous... This is probably because
his star quarterback has yet to show
up.

CHEF
(nervously checking
his watch)
Come on, Stan...

PIP
Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't
show up, can I use his helmet?

CHEF
No, Pip, I'm sorry.

EXT. SOUTH PARK

Stan looks tired and beaten as he walks through the frozen
tundra of South Park.

STAN
Sparky?! SPAAAARKY?!

COMMERCIAL BREAK #2

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - FIGHT

REFEREE
PLAY BALL!!

CHEF
You're gonna have to quaterback,
Kyle.

KYLE
But I never practiced quarterback.

CHEF
Well it's a little late for that
bullcrap now.

The ref blows his whistle and the kids head for the field.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Filling in for quarterback is number
12, Kyle Broslofski.

The townspeople all MOAN and GASP.

MR. GARRISON
Hey, hey, where's little Stanly?

MR. HAT
Yeah, why the hell is that little
Jewish kid playing quarterback?!

Jimbo and Ned look at each other worriedly.

JIMBO
Ned! Look!

Jimbo points to the Middle Park sidelines, where Enrique is
just barely visible in a little cage. Strapped around
Enrique's torso, is the large, obvious bomb.

JIMBO
They've got Enrique on their
sidelines! And it looks like that
bomb is still attached!

NED
Yea!

Jimbo and Ned rejoice.

EXT. BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY ANIMAL SANCTUARY

Stan walks up upon the HUGE compound on the outskirts of
town. A large man with a pencil mustache comes out of the
front gate.

BIG GAY AL
Hi, little fella, how are you doing
today?

STAN
Fine, how are you?

BIG GAY AL
I'm super, thanks for asking!

STAN
My gay dog ran away and I was
wondering if maybe he came here.

BIG GAY AL
Well... Let's see. Come on in!

Big Gay Al whisks Stan inside the compound.

EXT. BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY ANIMAL SANCTUARY

A huge outdoor compound with swimming pools and volleyball
sandpits and every animal imaginable.

STAN
Do you have lots of gay dogs here?

BIG GAY AL
We have all sorts of gay animals
here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we
have a gay lion --

A big GAY LION lounges in the corner.

GAY LION
Roar.

BIG GAY AL
And we have gay water buffalo, gay
hummingbirds -- here's a gaggle of
gay gooses.

A bunch of gooses walk by wing in wing and blow a kiss to
Al.

BIG GAY AL
Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!

STAN
Wow, it seems like the animals here
are really happy.

BIG GAY AL
Of course they are silly buns! It's
the one place where gay animals can
really be themselves. Do you like to
dance?

Big Gay Al hits a switch on the wall and raging TECHNO music
kicks in. All the animals start to gyrate.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

The South Park team is in a huddle.

KYLE
Cartman you hike me the ball. Then
somebody run and I'll throw it or
something. Ready...

PLAYERS
BREAK!

The kids step up to the line of scrimmage and look over the
ominous Middle Park players.

MIDDLE PARK PLAYER
You guys are toast.

MIDDLE PARK PLAYER #2
Yeah! We're gonna pound your heads
in!

CARTMAN
We'll just see about that!

Kyle gets behind Cartman, Cartman gets ready to hike the
ball.

KYLE
Set... Set...

Cartman farts.

KYLE
DAMMIT CARTMAN!!

Suddenly Kyle backs off.

CHEF
(Shouting)
What's the matter?!

KYLE
Cartman farted!

CARTMAN
No I didn't! That was just my shoes.

Chef rolls his eyes.

CHEF
Come on, Kyle, we'll get a delay of
game penalty!

KYLE
No way, dude!

CHEF
HIKE THE BALL!!

KYLE
Oh, dude, weak.

Kyle lifts his jersey up over his nose and gets back behind
Cartman.

CARTMAN
That's right you get back there now.

KYLE
HIKE!

The ball snaps.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
The ball is snapped... Middle Park
Blitzes!!

The Middle Park kids charge Kyle and pound the shit out of
him.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
FUMBLE!! Middle Park gets the ball...
They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN!! The
score is seven -- nothing Middle
Park with 14:57 remaining in the
first quarter.

In the stands, Ned and Jimbo look at each other with concern.

JIMBO
Hell's bells.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
I haven't seen a beating like that
since Rodney King.

Sportscaster Phil quickly covers the microphone.

SPORTSCASTER PHIL
Now Frank, that's not very P.C. you're
gonna get in trouble again!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Right, right, I gotta watch that...

TOWNSPERSON
If we lose our money 'cause of your
nephew, we're gonna hang you up to
dry, Jimbo!

JIMBO
Don't ya'll worry... You just wait
'til halftime!

INT. BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY ANIMAL SANCTUARY

The animals continue to dance. Stan dances techno with them,
when suddenly he spots something.

STAN
SPARKY!!

SPARKY
Bark.

Sparky walks over with his pink bandana, happy to see Stan.

STAN
Hiya Sparky, how's it going?

SPARKY
Bark.

STAN
I missed you, old pal, you really
had me scared.

SPARKY
Bark.

STAN
Come on, let's go home, I can still
make it in time for the game.

Sparky starts to follow Stan out.

STAN
We can work on making you not gay
together.

Sparky stops in his tracks. Stan turns back around, puzzled.

STAN
Sparky?

Just then, Big Gay Al walks up behind Stan.

BIG GAY AL
Young man it appears you still don't
understand.

STAN
What don't I understand?

BIG GAY AL
Come this way, I have to show you
something.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

ANNOUNCER
With just over a minute to go in the
half, the score is Middle Park Cowboys
52, South Park cows 0.

Kyle again hikes the ball, he hands off to Pip, whose head
is a bloody, dirty mass. Pip charges the line of scrimmage
and is immediately pummeled.

One of the Cowboys scoops up the ball and runs it in for a
touchdown.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
I haven't seen an Englishman take a
blow like that since Hugh Grant.

SPORTSCASTER PHIL
(Covering the mic)
Dude! Now that is NOT COOL!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Sorry, sorry.

INT. BIG GAY AL'S

Stan follows Big Gay Al through a large Corridor.

BIG GAY AL
Okay Stan, I think you should get in
line for my big gay boat ride.

Big Gay Al points to a Disneyland-esque ride with 'Big Gay
Al's Big Gay Boat Adventure' sign above it.

Little wooden boats travel along a man-made canal, similar
to the Jungle Cruise.

About four people are standing in line.

BIG GAY AL
Step aboard, Stanly.

Stan and Big Gay Al get on one of the little boats, which
heads down the canal. Big Gay Al picks up a microphone at
the front of the boat.

BIG GAY AL
Hello everyone, and welcome aboard
the big gay boat ride. On this
adventure, we'll be seeing the world
of gayness throughout time.

Stan blinks.

INT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

The Cowboys kick off the ball to the Cows.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
And the South Park Cows are set to
receive... There's the kick... It's
taken by number 23, Kenny McKormik.

Kenny grabs the ball and runs down the field. He actually
manages to dodge some tacklers!

He runs faster and faster! He just might make a good play!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
He's at the 50! The 40! The 30!

Suddenly, two Middle Park players tackle Kenny, violently
ripping off one of his arms. Kenny starts bleeding profusely,
then gets his head ripped off by another Cowboy player.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
The little running back is DOWN! I
think he's... Yes he's been
decapitated!

KYLE
OH MY GOD! THEY'VE KILLED KENNY! YOU
BASTARDS!!

SPORTSCASTER PHIL
That's gotta hurt, Frank!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Ouch-a-roo!

CHEF
Hey, come on, that was roughing!!
...At least let us scrape him off
the field!!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Looks like the South Park Cows aren't
even going to beat the 72 point
spread, not by a long shot.

INT. BIG GAY AL'S

BIG GAY AL
You see, Gayness has existed since
the beginning of time...

The boat passes little animatronic cave men. Two of the cave
men are holding hands.

BIG GAY AL
From the Egyptian Pharaohs...

The boat passes two gay Egyptian men.

BIG GAY AL
To the Shoguns of Japan...

Two Shoguns in a techno dance club.

BIG GAY AL
Oh, oh! Look out! It's the oppressors!
Christians and Republicans and Nazis
OH MY!

Three lame animatronics dressed respectively as a Christian,
a Republican and a Nazi, beat an innocent homosexual with a
pipe.

Just like the jungle cruise, Big gay Al takes out a fake
pistol and fires blanks at the animatronics.

BIG GAY AL
Hoo! Oh gosh That was close! Okay
let's steer our big gay boat out of
here, and into a place where gays
are allowed to live freely...

The boat passes through to large doors, which open into a
HUGE, colorful, festive room where tons of animatronics dance
and sing merrily.

SONG
We're all gay and it's okay! 'Cause
gay means happy and happy means gay!
We're not sad anymore 'cause we're
out the closet door! It's OKAY to be
GAY!!

Stan looks around in disbelief. All the gay things dance,
sing and do silly things.

SONG
It's okay to be Gay! it's okay to be
Gay! La La La La La...

BIG GAY AL
So what do you think, Stan?

STAN
This kicks ass!

Stan looks down at Sparky.

STAN
I'm sorry I tried to change you,
Spark. I just didn't understand.

Sparky barks and pants happily. Stan pets him on the head.

BIG GAY AL
Isn't this precious?

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - HALFTIME - NIGHT

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
And now here to sing the touching
song 'Loving You' is the one and
only... John Stamos' brother!!!

The crowd let's out a small smattering of applause. Music
begins.

Jimbo and Ned give each other knowing glances and then look
over at the Middle Park sidelines.

ANGLE - SIDELINES

Enrique is absolutely horrified, waiting to explode in the
midst of the Middle Park players.

RESUME - FOOTBALL FIELD

Patrick Stamos steps up to the mic and starts to sing.

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
Loving you... Is easy 'cause you're
beautiful...

ANGLE - JIMBO AND NED ANGLE - ENRIQUE RESUME - FOOTBALL FIELD

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
Do du doot'n da doo...

And then the big note is about to come...

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
(Low register)
Ahhha.....Ahhhh.......Ahhhhh.

Jimbo and Ned look shocked.

JIMBO
What the hell?! He didn't sing the
high F!!!

MR. GARRISON
Richard Stamos can't sing a high F.
He always screws it up like this.

Jimbo and Ned look absolutely defeated.

JIMBO
Ned... We're gonna get our asses
kicked.

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
Loving you...

MR. GARRISON
(heckling)
It's obvious where all the talent in
THAT family went!

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
Doot'n doot'n doo doo...

COMMERCIAL BREAK #3

EXT. BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY ANIMAL SANCTUARY

Stan, Sparky and Big Gay Al stand outside the Animal
Sanctuary.

STAN
Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!

SPARKY
Bark!!

BIG GAY AL
No problem kids! Are you sure you
don't wanna stay for some toasted
cheese sandwiches?

STAN
No thanks, I've gota get back for
the big football game. Come on boy!

Stan and Sparky run off.

BIG GAY AL
Oh Stan --

Stan turns around.

BIG GAY AL
When you get back to town... Tell
them about us, will you? Tell them
there are gay animals here who need
homes desperately.

STAN
I will Big Gay Al, I will.

Stan waves goodbye and runs off. Big Gay Al watches Stan go
fondly, and then suddenly panics.

BIG GAY AL
Ooh, my carrot cake!

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

The little football clad kids crash violently into each other.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
And these South Park cows are being
absolutely MOLESTED by Middle Park.
I haven't seen so many children
molested since --

In the stands, the townspeople are just sitting there, bored
and disheartened.

MR. GARRISON
I thought you said beating the spread
was a sure thing, Jimbo!

MR. HAT
Yeah, we all put our lives' savings
in this game!

TOWNSPERSON 1
You're a DEAD MAN, Jimbo!!

Jimbo shrinks in his seat as all the townspeople start YELLING
at him and throwing their food at him.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Well, this should just about wrap it
up for -- Wait a minute, what's this?

Suddenly, Stan and Sparky come running over the hill. The
townspeople all CHEER!!

SPORTSCASTER PHIL
It's Stan, the South Park star
quarterback!!

CHEF
Where the hell of you been, Stan?

STAN
I've been getting my best friend
back.

Sparky pants happily.

CHEF
Just get in there, boy!

Chef throws a helmet on Stan's head and pats his ass toward
the playing field.

JIMBO
Give 'em hell, Stanly!!

Stan walks up to the line of scrimmage.

JIMBO
(Praying)
Jesus... Now I haven't asked you for
much... But all we need is one little
score. PLEASE? PLEASE Jesus??

Pull back to reveal that Jesus is sitting next to him in the
stands.

JESUS
Leave me alone.

STAN
HIKE!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Stan hikes the ball... He steps back
to pass!!

KYLE
Hey Stan! I'm open I think!!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
And he throws it to Kyle, the little
Jewish kid!

Kyle catches the ball and runs down the field.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like
that since Poland, 1938!

SPORTSCASTER PHIL
DUDE!!

Kyle runs into the end zone and falls down.

SPORTSCASTER PHIL
TOUCHDOWN!!!!!

The crowd goes wild.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
The clock runs out! And the Final
score is Middle Park Cowboys 73,
South Park cows six! South Park beats
the spread.

Everybody cheers and hugs. The South Park Cows all converge
on Stan and rejoice.

Stan is heroically hoisted onto a small stage, where everybody
is gathered around.

TOWNSPERSON
Speech!

Sportscaster Frank steps up and shoves a microphone in front
of Stan.

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Stan, what do you want to tell the
world about this stunning almost
victory?

STAN
Uh... It... It's really cool that we
beat the spread against the Cowboys.

The townspeople all cheer.

STAN
And... And maybe we can beat 'em
even more next year!

The townspeople all cheer.

STAN
And it's okay to be gay!

The townspeople all get incredibly quiet.

JIMBO
What?!

STAN
Being gay is just a part of nature,
and a beautiful thing!

MR. GARRISON
What the hell is he talking about?!

SPORTSCASTER FRANK
Uh... Stanly you arrived very late
in the game, where were you that
whole time?

STAN
I was with my new friend Big Gay Al.
He showed me his Big Gay Animal
Sanctuary and took me on a Big Gay
Boat ride where I learned all about
the wonders of gayety.

The townspeople all look at each other and blink.

STAN
It's true, I'll show you.

EXT. BIG GAY AL'S BIG GAY ANIMAL SANCTUARY

Nestled between the two mountain peaks are... Nothing. No
Big Gay Al's... Nothing.

STAN
But it was here... It was all right
here. There was a techno dance club...

CARTMAN
Stan, you need to lay off the cough
syrup, alright, seriously I'm worried
about you man.

TOWNSPERSON
OLIVER!!

A townsperson runs over to where all the gay animals are
standing and picks up a cat.

TOWNSPERSON
I thought you ran away all those
months ago!

Now other townspeople walk toward the gay animals and start
to reunite.

TOWNSPERSON 2
SIDNEY!!

TOWNSPERSON 3
WHINNY!!

TOWNSPERSON 4
CARLOS!!

The townspeople all rejoice with their gay animals, leaving
Stan all alone.

BIG GAY AL
I want to thank you for bringing
everybody here.

Big Gay Al is standing there with a small suitcase, which he
sets on the ground and opens.

STAN
Oh, there you are, dude. How's it
going?

BIG GAY AL
I'm super, thanks for asking. It
looks like now my work here is done.

Big Gay Al steps into his suit case, and presses a large
blue button.

BIG GAY AL
Goodbye, Stanly, peace be with you.

The suitcase closes with Big Gay Al inside, then powers up
and shoots up into the sky to outer-space.

STAN
Wow...

Stan watches as the little suitcase ship becomes just another
twinkling star.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #4

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS!! I CAN DO IT!!

Everybody looks at Patrick Stamos.

MR. GARRISON
Do what?

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
(Singing)
Loving you... Is easy 'cause you're
beautiful. Doot'n Doot'n...

Enrique looks absolutely horrified. Jimbo and Ned look even
more horrified.

JIMBO
NO!!!

JOHN STAMOS' BROTHER
Doo Doo! AABOOOOMMM!!

"SOMETHING YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR FINGER"


Written by


Trey Parker





[A large city at night. Klieg lights pierce through the air as
a large crowd gathers in front of a large building.]

Announcer	Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band
of the decade! [women scream, jump, and shout. Signs sayins,
"FINGERBANG RULES" "FINGER BANG" "WE LOVE FINGER BANG" AND "FINGER
BANG 4EVER" bob throughout the audience] It's Fingerbang, live
from Madison Square Garden! [the interior is shown, with cheering
crowds. A heralding sound effect plays, and spotlights flicker
around the stage. A burst of fireworks cues the music and the
familiar silhouettes of four boys are shown on stage. A few women
faint]

FINGERBANG


Fingerbang! [they each spin towards the audience once, then stop]


Bang-bang!

Fingerbang-bang! [they spin back to their first positions]

Bangbangbang! [all step forward and do their routine]

I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life

Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright.

'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight

I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night

CARTMAN


And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl.

Girl, you're the girl of my fantasies.

You're my girl, you're my girl,

WOMAN
Cartman, I want youuu!

CARTMAN


My- ...girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breastum,
pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze
and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds
as women scream at the sight]

FINGERBANG


Fingerbang!

Bang. Bang bang bang.

Fingerbang-bang!

Bangbangbang!

I'm gonna fingerbang-bang-

"-you into my life

Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright."]

CARTMAN
Yes! Yes! Yes, I'm a star! I'm a star!
I'm-  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!
Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign
from God. That's it, isn't it? You want
me to start a boy band so I can make
$10 million, don't you? That's it!


[Cartman's house, day. Cartman has Stan, Kyle, and Kenny over
in the living room.]

CARTMAN
Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This
is the beginning of a great time in
our lives.  God has finally spoken to
me, you guys. And he has told me how
I can make $10 million.

KYLE
...How?

CARTMAN
Boy band.

STAN
Boy band?

CARTMAN
Boy band.

KYLE
I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!


CARTMAN
There's nothing faggy about $10 million,
asshole! This was a message from God!


STAN
Dude, we don't have any musical talent.


CARTMAN
That didn't stop any of the other boy
bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded
music we can sing to, just like they
do. All we need to do is practice our
choreography over and over and over!


KENNY
(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)


CARTMAN
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can
get us a gig at the South Park Mall.
So everybody get in a straight line,
we're gonna listen to a song from the
top, and take it-!

KYLE
Wait a minute. There's only four of
us.

CARTMAN
So?

KYLE
So, all boy bands have five members.


CARTMAN
What?

KYLE
*N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids On
The Block. All had five members.

STAN
He's right.

CARTMAN
Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll
put off practice for now, and hold auditions
for a fifth member. Get the word out
that auditions will be tomorrow morning!


[Stan's house, night. The family is gathered for dinner, enjoying
ham and turkey]

SHARON
Did you have fun at Eric's house today,
Stanley?

STAN
Well, I guess.

SHARON
What did you do?

STAN
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band,
so we're gonna rehearse and then try
to perform at the South Park Mall.


SHARON
Oh well, that sounds nice.

RANDY
No, it does not sound nice!  Stanley,
you are gonna have no part in that boy
band!

STAN
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing
it.

RANDY
If all your friends jumped off a cliff,
would you do that too?

STAN
Cartman says we can make $10 million.


RANDY
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN A BOY BAND,
STANLEY! AND THAT IS FINAL!

SHELLEY
Geez, what's up Dad's ass?

[Cartman's house, next morning, "BOY BAND AUDITIONS TODAY!!"
Music begins. Inside, Butters is singing his song in front of
the sofa]

BUTTERS


Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest

[scoops up imaginary mice, makes two fists, and bops the right
one with the left]

Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head

[shimmies down with hands outstretched. The auditors look half-asleep]


Down came a white angel and she said

[the angel (left finger) reprimands the bunny]

"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you

[the piano player seems familiar. The angle bops the bunny]


Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head."

So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo.
Eh, beh-POOF

[slaps his right hand with his left, and one finger goes down,
leaving a worm]

Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest

Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped
'im on the head

[grins, then does a little kick forward]

CARTMAN
Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let
you know.

BUTTERS
Ah, I can do it again.

CARTMAN
We'll let you know, Butters.

BUTTERS
Ahah-oo well, alright then.

CARTMAN
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was
so off!

KYLE
It was?

STAN
Dude, I don't think I could sing any
better than that.

CARTMAN
Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall
owner and get that gig, we'd better
do it better than that.  Next!

STAN
Uuuh, next is Ike Broflovski.

CARTMAN
Kyle's brother??

KYLE
I pormised my mom I'd let him try.


CARTMAN
Chist's sake!

PIANO KID
What key?

CARTMAN
Not the next song, the next PERSON!
Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass
day.

Cartman	Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a
BOY band! [a grinning Wendy suddenly frowns and her head hangs.]


STAN
Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.

CARTMAN
No way!

KYLE
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked
anybody else!

CARTMAN
Okayokay, fine! WOW me!

WENDY


Miiis-suuus Landers was a health nut. She cooked food in a wok.


Mr. Harris was her boyfriend, and he had a great big-

Your bladder gets infected, and blood comes out your-

Dictate what I'm saying, 'cause it will bring you luck

And if you all don't like it, I don't give a flying fuck!

[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny applaud]

CARTMAN
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't
call you either, heheh.

KYLE
Dude, what are you talkin' about? that
was awesome!

CARTMAN
Dude, she's a CHICK!

STAN
Come on, nobody's gonna notice.

CARTMAN
Nobody's gonna notice?! What about her
huge freakin' hooters, huh?!

STAN
She's the best chance we have! I say
she's in.

KYLE
Me too.

KENNY
(Me too.)

CARTMAN
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is
it? Alright, fine! She's in until she
screws up!

WENDY
Yeah!

[Cartman's house, next morning, early. A rooster crows. Cartman
has his band in his room, and they are still drowsy. Stan is
about to fall over...]

CARTMAN
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?


STAN
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do
we have to rehearse this early?

CARTMAN
We have to rehearse all that we can!
Now, check this out:  My mom made us
costumes!

STAN
Costumes?

CARTMAN
Yeah.  This one's yours, Stan. 'N this
one is Kyle's. This one will cover up
Wendy's hooters...

STAN
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume
has like, nose rings and facial hair?


CARTMAN
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough
one. Every boy band has to have the
one member that, you know, 's tough.


KYLE
I wanna be the tough one.

CARTMAN
...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will
you please just cooperate and not-


KYLE
I wanna be the tough one!

CARTMAN
You can't be the tough one, because
you're Jewish!

KYLE
Jews are tough!

CARTMAN
Since when?!

KYLE
Since Abraham, fatass!

CARTMAN
Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ,
I wonder if every boy band has to go
through this!

STAN
Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang"
mean, anyway?

CARTMAN
I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you
know, when you...  pretend to use your
finger like a gun or something.

KENNY
(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)


STAN
Kenny says that's not what it means.


CARTMAN
Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang"
mean, then?

KENNY
(It's when you take your finger, and
you stick it in a vagina and you stick
it again and again.)

CARTMAN
...What?! Who the hell would do that?!
Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?!
Alright, boys, let's do it from the
top. 1, 2, 3, 4,-!

[South Park Mall, day. South Park is not so small anymore. Two
guards on the second floor relax against a glass railing]

VETERAN GUARD
Now, I know that this is your first
day on the job of mall security, rookie.
Keepin' the law in a mall is just like
any tough city, and especially because
they don't let us have guns. It can
be very dangerous.

CARTMAN
Alright, guys. Let's do it like we
rehearsed! We nned energy! We need to
be up!

VETERAN GUARD
Excuse me, just where do you think
you're goin'?

CARTMAN
We're goin' to see the mall manager.


VETERAN GUARD
Do you have the proper clearance?

STAN
Uh oh, mall cops.

VETERAN GUARD
You have to make an appointment first.
Now move along, sir.

CARTMAN
But we practiced for days. All we want
to do is show the guy what we can do,
so that maybe we'll have a chance to
perform in the plaza of the- uh.  Aaaa!
Aaaa! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit!

KYLE
Jesus Christ!

CARTMAN
Oh, God, I can't see!

VETERAN GUARD
Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again.
You see, you put your life on the line
every day.

STAN
Well, I guess we can't get in to see
the mall manager.

CARTMAN
The hell we can't! I'm not lettin'
no washed-up law cops ruin my divine
quest! Come on!

[South Park Mall, later. The two guards are watching shoppers
move along. A blond man with two bags walks by.]

VETERAN GUARD
Ey!  What are you doin'?

MAN
Nothin'. Just... shoppin'.

VETERAN GUARD
Move along, sir.  You see, sometimes
you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers
on their toes  try it.

ROOKIE GUARD
Ey!  What are you doin'?

WOMAN
Nothing. Wwhy?

ROOKIE GUARD
Move along, ma'am.

VETERAN GUARD
That's what being a mall cop is all
about. Hyeuup.

ROOKIE GUARD
Cool.

CARTMAN
Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty
people to buy an orange smoothie will
also receive a complimetary Nissan Sentra.
Hurry up.

VETERAN GUARD
Jesus, they're gonna start a riot!


CARTMAN
Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!


MANAGER
What? Hey. Who are you?

CARTMAN
We... are Fingerbang!

MANAGER
O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here?
Hey.

CARTMAN
We would like to audition for you for
a gig in the central plaza of your fine
mall.

MANAGER
What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall?
Like Tiffany?

CARTMAN
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?


MANAGER
Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?

CARTMAN
Alright! Let's do it, boys!

FINGERBANG
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my
life

Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright.

I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night

CARTMAN


And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer,
girl.

You're good. You're gonna be-

MANAGER
Alright, that's enough!

CARTMAN
-you're my fantasy, you fanta-

MANAGER
Thank you.

CARTMAN
Woll. So, can we play here?

MANAGER
What?? ...No.

CARTMAN
No??

MANAGER
Who?? No!

CARTMAN
Why not?!

MANAGER
Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a
cheese and sausage cart in the plaza.
And I would uh, I'd hate to have to
move it off to the side for a while.
What?

CARTMAN
You don't think we're any good, do you?!


MANAGER
No. I mean, you're just not as good
as sausage and cheese.

CARTMAN
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best.


MANAGER
Wow. That was your best?

[South Park Mall, later. The five are sitting on a bench on the
first floor]

KYLE
Wow. I feel so rejected.

STAN
Yeah.

VETERAN GUARD
There you are! You're the hoodlums who
got on the intercom and started an orange
smoothie riot!

STAN
Uh oh.

VETERAN GUARD
I will now read you your mall rights!
You have the right to shop at a variety
of malls in all-

KYLE
Run for it!

VETERAN GUARD
Go get 'em, rookie!

[Stan's house, later. Shelley's eating cereal, Sharon is at the
sink. Randy enters]

RANDY
Where is Stan?

SHARON
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing
for his boy band.

RANDY
What?! I specifically told him not to
do that!

SHARON
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly
little dream. They're not gonna actually
make it.

RANDY
And what if they do make it, Sharon?!
What if they DO make itare YOU gonna
be the one to tell 'im?!

SHELLEY
Mom, what's up Dad's ass?

SHARON
It's a long story, Shelley. Let's just
say your father- ...has a lot up his ass
right now.

[Chef's house. Cartman arrives and rings the bell]

CHEF
Oh! Oh-ah, hello Eric.

CARTMAN
Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.


CHEF
Wellll, if you uuhh, come back in just
a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can
help you out.

CARTMAN
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying
with me.

CHEF
Alright, Eric, what's the matter?


CARTMAN
Chef, God told me I was to start a boy
band and make $10 million. The problem
is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel
the music burning inside me. But I just
can't express it right, you know?


CHEF
Well, Eric, I, I think you were just
focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy
bands aren't about music, Boy bands
are created by corporations to make
money. They're all based on the Gomlich
effect.

CARTMAN
What's the Gomlich effect.

CHEF
The law of physics that states, "If
one girl screams for something, it will
make other girls scream. And then, it
grows exponentiously until all girls
within a five-mile radius are screaming."


CARTMAN
So how do boy bands use that?

CHEF
All they do is make videos, showing
tons and tons of girls screaming for
the boy band. Once you get girls screaming,
you can't stop 'em. They're crazih!
Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course.


CARTMAN
Thanks!

CHEF
You're welcome. Now, go away!  A-and
a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!


CARTMAN
Cucumber in the pants. Got it.

CARTMAN
Alright, everybody, listen up! This
is how this first shot is gonna work:
The girls are standing here, and then
the members of the band walk by looking
cool. When you see us, you girls all
scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang.
Oh my God." Okay?

BEBE
Are we gonna get paid now, or after?


CARTMAN
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay,
Timmy, roll camera.

TIMMY
Tiimmmaaayyy!

KYLE
Dude, what's wrong with your leg?

CARTMAN
Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber
down my pants for good luck.

THE GIRLS
Aaah. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.

CARTMAN
Waitwaitwaitwait, CUT!

TIMMY
Huhaaaaah!

CARTMAN
Let's go crazier than that! I mean,
you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo
Di Caprio!

BEBE
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo
Di Caprio came walking past us.

THE OTHER GIRLS
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?

THE GIRLS
...Matt Lauer.

CARTMAN
...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt
Lauer.

BEBE
Oh. Okay.

CARTMAN
Roll camera!

TIMMY
Timmuh!

THE GIRLS
AAAAAAAAAH!

CARTMAN
Jesus Christ!

[South Park Elementary, playground, later. The band is still
shooting the video. Bebe and the redhead make a fuss over Cartman]


FINGERBANG
Firgerbang-bang you ever-y night

CARTMAN
Aaand CUT.  Alright, our video's complete.
Through the grace of God I can now go
back to that mall manager and show him
what ve've got!

BEBE
Okay, so where's our money?

CARTMAN
Oh uh, Kyle has it.

RANDY
Stanely, what the hell are you doing?


STAN
We are making a music video.

RANDY
You get in the truck right now!

STAN
Dad, I was just a-

RANDY
GET IN THE TRUCK!

[The road, the Marsh truck. Randy drives Stan home]

STAN
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't
I play with my friends?

RANDY
Stanley, it's just that there's better
things you could be doing on a Saturday
than singing and dancing. You could
be warching TV or, laying in bed.


STAN
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think
it's interesting.

RANDY
Well, there's plenty of other interesting
you can do! Have you ever tried marijuana?


STAN
No.

RANDY
Well, maybe it's time.

STAN
Dad!

[South Park Mall, late morning. The guards relax on the second
floor railings. A stooped man with a clear vessel filled with
a green substance walks past them]

VETERAN GUARD
Ey! What are you doin'?

MADMAN
I've got a new strain of anthrax that
I will soon unleash upon all of North
America!

VETERAN GUARD
Move along, sir.

MADMAN
Wuh?

CARTMAN
Attention, shoppers: There are naked
people at the orange smoothie machine.
There are naked people at the orange
smoothie machine.

A RUNNING SHOPPER
Oh my God!

VETERAN GUARD
God damnit!

CARTMAN
Hello again!

MANAGER
What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.


CARTMAN
I know you didn't love our audition.
But now we have a video.

MANAGER
Oh. What?

CARTMAN
If you would, sir, just watch this
and prepare to be wowed!

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

CARTMAN
Uh God damnit! Our camera guy kinda
sucks, but this next shot we did was
really cool.

TIMMY
Haaaah.  Timmih, livin' a lie!

CARTMAN
Son of a bitch!

MANAGER
Hey. This video is dumb.

CARTMAN
You don't understand. Girls were going
crazy for it. Please. This is what God
want me to do. Ple-ease.

MANAGER
Alright alright. What? Well, I guess
I can move the sausage and cheese cart
off to one side.  For a little while.


CARTMAN
Really? You will?

MANAGER
Only for twenty minutes, though.

CARTMAN
That's all we need! How about this afternoon
at 3 o'clock?

MANAGER
Oh. Okay.

CARTMAN
Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be
disappointed!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very
bad. M'kay?

LIANE
You have been bad, so you're gonna have
to drink from this glass.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay?


CARTMAN
Aw, mom!

MANAGER
Wow. What?

[The Marsh house, later. Stan sits on the sofa as Randy paces
the floor back and forth]

STAN
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in
a boy band?!

RANDY
Because I said so!

STAN
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform
at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends
are gonna be pissed off at me.

RANDY
Let 'em be pissed off, then!

STAN
I don't understand! Just let me go do
this one thing, and I won't ever-


RANDY
NOOO!!  NOOO!!

STAN
Dad? What the hell is going on?

RANDY
...I was- ...I was 18 when my high-school
men's choir performed at the grand opening
of a sporting-goods store.in Denver.
I was just one of fifteen members and
I had no idea that a record producer
was in the audience.

PRODUCER
Kid, can I talk to you?

RANDY
Uh sure.

PRODUCER
Heh, you were really great up there.
Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant
mountain town.

RANDY
Ohh, thanks.

PRODUCER
Listen: I'm putting together a rock
group. A vocal group called the Ghetto
Avenue Boys. I think you would make
a perfect member.

RANDY
What? Me? Do you like my singing that
much?

PRODUCER
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect.
How would you like to come to New York
and start a singing career?

RANDY
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still
have another year of high school, and
I-

PRODUCER
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll
keep looking-

RANDY
No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about
it.

PRODUCER
I take it that means yes. Call me in
the morning.

RANDY
And just like that I left everything.
I dropped out of high school...

RANDY
See ya.

RANDY
...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...


RANDY
See ya.

RANDY
...And I left my family.

RANDY
See ya.

RANDY
And suddenly there I was, thrown into
a group with four other young men who
I didn't even know.

PRODUCER
Take 112!

GHETTO AVENUE BOYS
You've... got... it!

What you've got is it!

RANDY
It's obvious to me.

RANDY
The songs were terrible. But believe
it or not, the country ate them up.
The next thing I knew, we were the biggest
thing in the world.

GHETTO AVENUE BOYS
Shirl! You've... got... it!

It... is what you've got, girl!

What you've got is it!

RANDY
Now, give it to me, 'cause-

RANDY
I had everything. A huge house,  and
all the women you can imagine.  And
then one day, just as quick as it started...


PRODUCER
Alright, guys, let's take it from the
top.

RANDY
Hey, Mr. Allens

PRODUCER
Heh? Woh. Uh. R-randy.

RANDY
Who are they

PRODUCER
These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys,
my... new boy band.

RANDY
But, w-we're still selling records,
right?

PRODUCER
Look, kid, you're just getting a little...
old to be in a boy band.

RANDY
I'm 19.

PRODUCER
Get a life, Marsh!  Alright, guys, let's
take it from the top.

RANDY
They said that after all the money we
had made we were in debt to the studio,
so they towed my car...

TOW TRUCK DRIVER
See ya.

RANDY
...the women all left...

WOMEN
See ya.

RANDY
...and they took back my house

RANDY
Ugh.

PRODUCER
See ya.

RANDY
The only thing I could do was come back
to Colorado, and face everyone that
I had abandoned.

WOMAN
Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid
boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?


MAN
Sure, I remember you!  You got it, baby.
You got it, baby.

RANDY
And so you see, Stanley, I... do know
what I'm talking about.

STAN
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.

RANDY
I didn't want you to know. Because now
I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished
every single day that I could go back
to that moment when I was offered the
job and say, "No!" Because all the fame
and the money, the womenall it did
was build me up, so that I could be
knocked down harder than anybody in
the world.  That is what being in a
boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's
people smothering you and embracing
you and loving you and then ssspitting
you out and throwing you away like you
were last night's pork chops! Now we
wander the earth in disarrayus, New
Kids On The Block, the Osmonds... We're
all the same. And THAT... is why you can't
go to the mall!

STAN
...Oh-kay.

[South Park Mall, afternoon. Most of Fingerbang is on the plaza
stage, peeking out from behind a curtain with the band's name
on it. People begin to gather in front of the stage.]

KYLE
Wew. There must be at least 20 people
out there.

CARTMAN
Where the hell is Stan?!

KYLE
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.


CARTMAN
I swear to God, if he ruins this dream
of mine I will HAVE HIS NUTS!

MANAGER
Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing
or what?

CARTMAN
Yes. Yes, sir, any secondwe're just
waiting on one more member.

MANAGER
Well hurryup. I can't keep the sausage
and cheese cart off this spot much longer.


CARTMAN
Yeah. We'll start right away.  We'll
have to do it without him.

KYLE
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member
boy band! We'll look stupid!

KENNY
(Yeah!)

CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit!

[The Marsh house, later. Randy is sitting at the foot of his
bed, reading from an issue of Teen Heat dedicated to the band.
The camera zooms out fron the magazine cover to Randy reading]


STAN
Dad?

RANDY
Huh? Yeah?

STAN
Well,... I just wanted to tell you... that
I don't think you're a joke. I mean,
whatever you used to be, you're just
my dad. And you're the best dad I've
ever had.

RANDY
Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong
of me to try and stop you from joining
a boy band without explaining why. I've
made some mistakes in my life, and now...
I have to let you make your own mistakes.


STAN
Yeah.

RANDY
You know, in a way, I think I was even
jealous of you being in a boy band.
Isn't that stupid?

STAN
Not really. Not any more stupid than
some of the other stuff you've done.


RANDY
Well, come on. I'll drive you down to
the mall.

STAN
Really??

RANDY
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can
do. And then we'll go buy you a small
toy so that you can forget all about
this.

STAN
Alright!

[South Park Mall, afternoon. Everyone is waiting for Fingerbang
to sing]

MAN
What's happening here?

WOMAN
I don't know, uh. I guess nothng.

MAN
Hm. Well, let's just walk away then.


CARTMAN
God damnit! People are walking away!


MANAGER
Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're
gonna have to move and make way for
the sausage and cheese cart.

CARTMAN
Just another minute.

MANAGER
Sorry! Get out!

CARTMAN
Well God, I guess you got me again,
didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one,
God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick
bastard.

WENDY
What's that?

KYLE
It's Stan!

CARTMAN
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name!


KYLE
Dude, where the hell have you been?!


CARTMAN
Sir! We're all here now! Can we go
on, please?

MANAGER
Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry
up.

CARTMAN
We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are
about to witness the next great boy
band of the countrih! Someday you will
all be among those who can say, "I saw
Fingerbang when they first performed
at some crappy little mall."  And so,
without further ado, all five members
of the...

KENNY
(Uf)

STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastards!

CARTMAN
No! He can't be dead!

KYLE
Dude, he's pretty dead.

CARTMAN
No! We were so close!

MANAGER
Alright, that's it, kids! Get out!


CARTMAN
But we have to perform!

KYLE
We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!


STAN
Oh, yes we do.

[South Park Mall, later. The stage is set, the intro begins]


CARTMAN
Thank you all for your patience, and
now get ready for Fingerbang!

FINGERBANG


Fingerbang!

Bang bang. [audience members look at each other]

Fingerbang-bang!

Bangbangbang. [people begin to leave]

I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life

Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright. [Janitors wearing
face masks scrape Kenny's remains off the elevator]

'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight [the veteran
mall guard swivels his hips around happily as the rookie looks
on]

Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!

CARTMAN
Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank youuuu, yes!


[South Park Mall, later. Janitors continue cleaning the elevator
that crushed Kenny, the sausage and cheese cart is rolled back
on stage, and Fingerbang sits on the edge of the stage, dropping
pieces of their costumes into the pit below]

KYLE
We made two dollars.

STAN
You were great, dad.

RANDY
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a
little.

LITTLE GIRL
Can I get your autograph?

CARTMAN
Ok- Okay okay

VETERAN GUARD
Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am!


LITTLE GIRL
I actually don't really know who they
are, I was just getting an autograph
and-  A-a-aaa-a-aaah!

VETERAN GUARD
Move along, ma'am.  Eh, that was pretty
good, kids. Maybe you can come perform
at my Elks Club sometime.

CARTMAN
Okay, yeah, maybe.  God. Now it's like
everybody wants a piece of us.

KYLE
Yeah.

CARTMAN
I don't know if I can handle all this
fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna
become famous, but now that I am, I
don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably
can't even walk through this mall right
now without people goin', "Oh my God,
it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"


KYLE
...Yeah. That's gonna suck.

STAN
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again.
Have a normal life and appreciate what
I have.

RANDY
Well, I think you boys are very smart
for your age. Come on. I'll buy you
all an orange smoothie.

STAN
I don't think they sell those anymore.


KYLE
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting
mad at you for not making $10 million?


CARTMAN
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him.
He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin',
right? Heheyeah.

"FAT BUTT AND PANCAKE HEAD"


Written by


Trey Parker





CELEBRATE CULTURAL DIVERSITY

[South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is speaking to the school in
the school gym, which is nicely decorated in the flags of many
nations, both on the rafters and on the small stage set up at
one end of the basketball court.]

KYLE
And in conclusion, the Latino community
has provided America, and indeed, the
entire world with innovations that we
would be lost without. And that is my
presentation on the role of Hispanics
in American technology. Thank you.


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
That was very good, Kyle. I think the
Latino Endowment Council was very happy
with your presentation. Looks like you
might win.

KYLE
Cool.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right, students, members of the
school board. Our last speaker will
discuss the important role of Latinos
in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman.
Eric Cartman?

CARTMAN
Thank you. The Latino culture has been
very influential on the arts in America.
But you don't have to ask me. You can
ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer
Lopez.

KIDS
Jennifer Lopez?

KYLE
No way.

CARTMAN
Miss Lopez, come on out here.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Hallooo.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, Jesus Christ.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos,
y burritos.

CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about
Lations and the arts?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh sí, sí. But first I would like to
put on my pretty dress.

CARTMAN
Oh, you mean this one?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh sí sí sí. I like it very much.

CARTMAN
There we go, Saright?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"

A COUNCIL MEMBER
Hahahahaha, oh my.

CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your
example of Latino arts?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Don't be fooled by all my money. I still
like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy
on the outside, so super good and yummy.


CARTMAN
And that is my presentation on Latinos
in the arts. Thank you.

[South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down one side inside the
mall. Cartman leads the way]

CARTMAN
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate
at the mall! I can buy whatever I want!
Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!


KYLE
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing
my speech on Latino culture.

CARTMAN
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.


KYLE
No you didn't, asshole! What you did
was totally stupid and racist! And you
only did it to screw me over!

CARTMAN
Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you,
Ms. Lopez.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Aww, that makes me muy triste.

CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh sí sí, very much.

CARTMAN
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle
a kiss?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh sí, sí sí, my kisses taste like tacos.


CARTMAN
Is nice?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Is bery nice. He's so hansome.

KYLE
Stop it!

CARTMAN
Hey, come one guys! We can use part
of my gift certificate to buy food at
the food court.

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

[South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down the mall. Cartman's
hand is finishing off a taco as he looks at it.]

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Mmm, tacos! So yummy!

KYLE
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand,
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.

KYLE
She's not eating it, it's just comint
out her backside!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
When you eat a taco it comes out your
backside too, cholo!

KENNY
(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Look look! Make your own music video!


KYLE
Nonono, we're not going into one of
those cheesy places, Cartman!

CARTMAN
I agree. Those places are stupid.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
It's not stupid. I need to make music
video.

STAN
Look, we're not going in there, so
just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking
to your hand?  Look, we're not going
in there, so just knock it off!

CARTMAN
Hey, I'm on your guys's side.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Just wait one minute, let me see how
much it is.

KYLE
God damnit!

CASHIER
Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All
set to rock and roll?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
How much to make a video?

CASHIER
Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for
a three-minute tape.

CARTMAN
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh please! Come on, guys!

KYLE
Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!


CARTMAN
All right all right, here's ten dollars!


KYLE
That's not what I meant!

CASHIER
All right, just come over here and stand
in front of the green screen.  What
kind of song do you want?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Something warm and spicy.  Spicier.
Spicierrr!

Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.

Don't think that just because I got a lot of money

I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey!

Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.

Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.

CASHIER
You know, I've seen a lot of videos
here at the mall, and that was by far
the best!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh, gracias, "Machél"!

CASHIER
Hey, I've got a friend who's interning
at a big record label in L.A. I'll send
a copy on to him and maybe he'll get
the bigwigs to see ya.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!

KYLE
Can we go now, please?!

CARTMAN
Yeah, I wanna leave.

KYLE
Stop it, Cartman!

CARTMAN
What?

[BHI records, L.A. day. The tape is being played on a massive
screen in an office.]

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored
kisses.

Taco taco.

BHI PRESIDENT
She's fantiastic. Who is she?

AIDE 1
Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer
Lopez

AIDE 2
That makes sense. She reminds me of
J-Lo.

BHI PRESIDENT
Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco
taco.

AIDE 2
I don't think J-Lo would like it very
much if we signed this new girl.

BHI PRESIDENT
No, you're right. We're gonna have to
fire J-Lo.

[Cartman's house, day. The phone rings in the kitchen and he
answers it.]

CARTMAN
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for
you, Ms. Lopez.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh, sí sí sííí. Allo!

CARTMAN
What do they want?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Just a second, I'm trying to hear.


CARTMAN
S'awright?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
S'awright.  Yes yes, this is Ms. Hrrrlopez.
Uh huh.

CARTMAN
What? What?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh my God I can't believe it!!!

CARTMAN
Hello hello, are you still there?


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
They want to sign me to the rrrecord
companyyy!

CARTMAN
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh my God, it's happening for me!

CARTMAN
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next
week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll
start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
We're gonna be famose!

CARTMAN
Come on, we gotta get to work on some
songs!

[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is on his bed writing away on
a notepad]

CARTMAN
There. That's three more songs we've
written already! Your style of music
is so easy it doesn't require any thought
at all!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh, sí sí sííí.

CARTMAN
Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep.


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy.

CARTMAN
Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna
be a great day. Great day tomorrow...
Tomorrow...  "Kyle, you were wrong!
We did do a record deal!"  "You were

"Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!"
Awesommme. Yeeessss.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Aaahhhh. Aaahhhh.

[An Oscar ceremony. Two Oscars stand guard over a red carpet.
On either side of the carpet is a crowd of people. A limo pulls
up and a hand floats out of it.]

MAN 1
Ms. Lopez! Up here!

MAN 2
Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!

MAN 3
Jennifer, over here.

MAN 4
Jennifer!

[A concert. Her first single is thumping away, and she appears
as just a hand, floating over the stage floor]

FEMALE FAN
We love you Jennifer!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Aaahhhh.

[BHI Records, Los Angeles, day. The president and his men are
in a meeting when he looks up]

BHI PRESIDENT
Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in.

JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot
at two and a script reading at five.


BHI PRESIDENT
Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopes, we regret to
inform you that, uh... we're dropping
you from the label.

JENNIFER LOPEZ
What? Oh no you di'n't!

AIDE 1
We wanna thank you for all your hard
work and ..."talent".

JENNIFER LOPEZ
You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez!
How can you drop me?!

BHI PRESIDENT
Wu-well a very talented younger singer
has come to our attention and, and the
truth of the matter is her name happens
to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we
really can't have two here at BHI Records.


JENNIFER LOPEZ
Who the hell is this other Jennifer
Lopez?! Where 'os she come from?!


AIDE 1
Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado
now, but uh I believe she originally
from Mexico, just like you.

JENNIFER LOPEZ
I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah
Rican!

BHI PRESIDENT
Whatever. Look, it's nothing persona,
we just think you need to move on.


AIDE 2
Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch
who spits on people who aren't rich
and famous.

[A limosine, from the back seat. A small TV is on near the floor,
behind the driver.]

REPORTER
And sources say that the new film will
star Ben Affleck.

BEN
Huhuhuh, that's me.  How'd it go, baby?


JENNIFER LOPEZ
Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado
is trying to become the new Jennifer
Lopez!  Shut up!

BEN
What?? Who could replace you??

JENNIFER LOPEZ
Yo driver. Stupid driver!

DRIVER
Yes, ma'am. Where to?

JENNIFER LOPEZ
Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm
gonna kill that bitch!!

[South Park Elementary, day. The kids file in to class. Many

CARTMAN RUNS UP

MR. SLAVE
Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?


MR. GARRISON
Well what are we waiting for? Let's
get outside!

[South Park Elementary, outside, later. Word gets around and
all of the school comes out to see for itself]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Here she comes! Here she comes!

JENNIFER LOPEZ
Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass
bitch has been saying they're the new
Jennifer Lopez, huh?!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with
the kids?

JENNIFER LOPEZ
No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks
she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna
wring her pretty little neck!  So, nobody
want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to
talk?! You'd better remember, bitch,
that I'll come and take you down if
you ever say anythin' again!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
You can suck my culo, chica!

JENNIFER LOPEZ

CARTMAN

JENNIFER LOPEZ

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Hola, bitchola!

JENNIFER LOPEZ
What the hell is that?!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like
tacos, and burritos.

JENNIFER LOPEZ
That? That's what replaced me?!

CARTMAN
I'm sure it was just a mistake.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Only mistake was when this ghetto trash
got signed in the first place!

CARTMAN
Shut your God-damned mouth!

JENNIFER LOPEZ
You fucking smartass, who do you think
you are?!

CARTMAN
Nobody

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"

BHI PRESIDENT

Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.

CARTMAN

[Cartman's house, day. Ben Affleck approaches the front door
with a bouquet of flowers and knocks on the door]

CARTMAN
Heyesss.

BEN
Hey, I was wondering if I could talk
to Ms. Lopez.

CARTMAN
She's not here right now.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Ben? Is that my darling Ben?

BEN
Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Ben!!! Oh, you bought me rrrrroses!


BEN
Jenny, I just can't stop thinking about
you.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
I can't stop thinking about you either,
Ben!

BEN
I've been meaning to write a song or
a poem, but I have no talent.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
I know, my darleeeng. That's okay.


BEN
Will you just take a ride with me in
my awesome car?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh Ben, I would LOVE to!

CARTMAN
NO!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
'Scuse me one second, Ben.  Don't you
ruin this opportunity for me! How can
you stand in the way of this?!

CARTMAN
I'm not going out in his car.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
I'm not gonna let you blow this one
chance I have.

CARTMAN
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here
and do my homework.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Don't you dare

CARTMAN
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's
gonna get in trouble if you don't-!
Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Okay, Ben, let's go!

[A mountain road. Ben and Cartman drive along at a fast clip]


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh Ben, I am soo happy! The cool breeze
blowing through my hair in your sexy
automobile.

BEN
Let's spend the whole day together!


[a soft song plays. The next scene is a dawn on a beach, where
"Jennifer Lopez" and Ben run side by side. Next is a restaurant
where Ben has some wine while "Jennifer Lopez" enjoys a martini.
Next scene, they're watching a movie together. "Jennifer Lopez"
has her own seat between Ben and Cartman. Bem stretches and puts
his hand on the headrest behind "Jennifer Lopez". Cartman looks,
then looks away angrily. Next scene is at a jewelry store, where
Ben picks out some earrings for "Jennifer Lopez". "Jennifer Lopez"
opens her mouth in delight and Ben smiles. Next scene, Ben is
resting on Cartman's lap and chatting with "Jennifer Lopez".
Again, Cartman looks away in disgust. Last scene is undercover
photos taken of Ben and "Jennifer Lopez", which end up on The
National Inquisition.]

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr
in every way

You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget
all about...

Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
But what if you still have feelings

BEN

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh Ben. Beennn.

[Music Lab Recording Studio, night. "Jennifer Lopez" is recording
new tracks. Cartman is practically sleeping on the job as his
hand belts out new tunes]

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?


Two tacos chulo, too. I'm just Jenny from the hood.

Ooo, can I have your tacos? Oh- stop. Stop, stop. STOP! [the

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Fine my ass, cholo!  I'll tell you when

[Music Lab Recording Studio, night, back entrance. Cartamn exits
and goes down three steps.]

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to
make an album with those cholos?!


JENNIFER LOPEZ
You little snot-nose!  You ruin my
career and now you're trying to steal
my man?!

CARTMAN
Aww crap.

JENNIFER LOPEZ
You'd better stay away from him!

CARTMAN
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. Dr. Doctor is showing Liane,
Cartman's mother, an X-ray of her son's hand]

DR. DOCTOR
Your son's hand has a hairline fracture
and two dislocated fingers.

LIANE
Oh dear.

DR. DOCTOR
But I'm more concerned about his state
of mind. Your son appears to be completely
insane.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Ahhh Ahhhh

CARTMAN
I told you this would happen.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh, hello guys.

KYLE
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid
little game you're playing!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?

CARTMAN
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on,
we're staying away from Ben Affleck.


KYLE
I hate you.

LIANE
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need
to get home and get lots of rest.


[Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows. Cartman, asleep, stretches
and wakes up, then glances to his left.]

CARTMAN
EHAGH!  Moooooommmm!

LIANE
What is it, sweetie?

CARTMAN
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!

LIANE
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was
extra-happy with youuu.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Buenos días, my love.

BEN
Good morning, baby.

CARTMAN
You have to get out of here! Jennifer
Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were
up all night making love.

CARTMAN
What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!


BEN
Should we tell him the news?

CARTMAN
What news?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
I think we should tell him.

BEN
It's S'aright?

CARTMAN
S'aright.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
S'aright.

BEN
We're getting married!!

CARTMAN
Oh, balls!

[Kyle's house, day. He, Stan and Kenny watch TV on the couch.
The doorbell rings]

KYLE
Come in.  COME IN!!

CARTMAN
Guys, I need to talk to you.

STAN
What's the matter?

CARTMAN
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame
and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just
can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.


KYLE
So stop doing it!

CARTMAN
Stop doing what?

KYLE
You know God-damn well what! Now get
outta here!

CARTMAN
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't
even have a moment to myself anymore.
See?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Don't you dare ever do that to me again!


KYLE
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand
doesn't need to breathe!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
You try being in an oven mitt for two
hours!

KYLE
I can see your lips moving!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
I can see your lips moving too, culo!


KYLE
See?! I just saw your lips move!

CARTMAN
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help.
Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.


STAN
What's she doing?

KYLE
Come here!  You're not actually buying
this crap, are you?!

STAN
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help
it.

KYLE
Look, he knows full well what he's doing,
and he's just waiting for us to buy
into it, and then he'll laugh and point
at our faces and say, "Haha, I got you
guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"


STAN
Dude, do you really he would go through
all this just to make [us feal dumb?


KYLE
YES, dude!

STAN
Cartman, we decided that if you can
be mature and admit to everyone that
you've gotten yourself into this mess,
then we'll help you.

CARTMAN
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything
Ms. Lopez does.

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Oh no you don't!

CARTMAN
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.

KYLE
Out!

CARTMAN
Guys... Uh... Uh...

[Outside, day. Cartman reaches the sidewalk when he sees something]


BEN
There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin'
all over for you, baby!  Jenny?

AIDE 1
Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio
two hours ago! Come on!

JENNIFER LOPEZ
So you're gettin' married, huh?

BEN
Don't you hurt her!

BHI PRESIDENT
We'll sue you!

KYLE
Oh Jesus.

[A bridge over a wide river, day. Jennifer Lopez has followed
Cartman here. Cartman screams. A police car pulls up from the
other end of the bridge. The driver steps out, and both officers
drraw their guns at Jennifer Lopez, now unrecognizable]

POLICE OFFICER 1
Freeze, leafblower!

AIDE 1
Arrest that woman! She wants to kill
one of our artists!

POLICE OFFICER 2
All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.


BEN
Jenny! Oh, I thoughth I was goin' lose
you! Let's run away and get married
tongiht!

AIDE 2
Hey, she can't get married tonight,
she has a recording session!

BEN
Our love is like rain!

JENNIFER LOPEZ
That's what you said about me, asshole!


"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Quiet!

BHI PRESIDENT
Get her out of here!

JENNIFER LOPEZ
Fuck you!

POLICE OFFICER 2
Shut up, picante pants!

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
Everyone be quiet!  I'm... I'm not who
you think I am.

BHI PRESIDENT
You're not?

"JENNIFER LOPEZ"
No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot
contimue anymore. I am not Hennifer
Lopez. I am...  ...Mitch Connor.


POLICE OFFICER 2
Who is Mitch Connor?

"MITCH CONNOR"
Just your run of the mill con man. I've
been moving from town to town, scamming
people since I was fifteen. But I'm
tired of running.

KYLE
Oh no, no no, nonono.

"MITCH CONNOR"
I've been a cheater all my life. And
now I've ruined a singer's career, lost
a record company millions, and cost
this little boy his precious time.


KYLE
Stop. It.

"MITCH CONNOR"
Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry
I played Tiddly Winks with your heart.
But it's over now. The cyanide pill
I took should be taking effect very
soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin'
down. I wonder, will I dream?

POLICE OFFICER 2
Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed
in his last chips.

KYLE
Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?


CARTMAN
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look,
I don't care what you guys believe.
But with all the crazy stuff that goes
on in this town, isn't it possible,
just possible, that something I don't
understand happened here?

KYLE
All right.  All right, I guess it's
possible.

CARTMAN
Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I
got you kinda!

[A fast-food Mexican Restaurant, La Taco. People are enjoying
their food, one person is waiting for his order, and there are
employees behind the counter. One of them looks familiar...]


MANAGER
Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the
toppings station. This is where all
your cheeses and lettuce go on.  .


JENNIFER LOPEZ
Ow. Look out, muffinhead!

MANAGER
Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're
gonna be a member of the La Taco family,
you're gonna have to learn to get along
with people.

JENNIFER LOPEZ
Get a what with who?

MANAGER
Uh why don't you start chopping those
onions and I'll come check on you a
little later?

JENNIFER LOPEZ
This is bullshit! How the fuck did
I end up working in a La Taco?! I had
six platinum records and I starred in
five Hollywood movies!

COWORKER
Yeah. Me too.

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"

Episode 214

"CHEF AID"

Written by

Trey Parker & Matt Stone



[South Park Elementary cafeteria, lunchtime. Some of the kids
have their lunches. In line are Jordan, Stan, Kyle, Cartman,
Kenny, the black kid, ]

CARTMAN
Stinky britches, you've got stinky britches


Stinky stinky britches, you've got stinky-

KYLE
What the hell are you singin', Cartman?


CARTMAN
This new song by Alanis Morissette.
I can't get it out of my head. Stinky
britches, you've got stinky britches!


MR. GARRISON
Hello children. Ready for lunch?

CARTMAN
Stinky britches, you've got stinky stinky-!


MR. GARRISON
Eric, is there a problem?

CARTMAN
Yeah, I can't get this stupid song out
of my head!

MR. GARRISON
"Stinky Britches," by Alanis Morissette?


CARTMAN
Yeah. You stinky stinky britches!

MR. GARRISON
Children, did you say 'hi' to Mr. Twig?


MR. TWIG
Hi, boys. How are you?

KYLE
When is Mr. Hat coming back?

MR. GARRISON
I told you never to say his name in
my presence!

STAN
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.


STUDENT
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Stinky britches, you've got stinky
br-

MR. GARRISON
It just so happens that Mr. Twig is
far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever
be! So he's the better puppet!

KYLE
He'd be better used as a coat rack.


MR. GARRISON
How DARE you?! Come on, Mr. Twig!


[The kids enter the kitchen. Jordan left the line, leaving Stan
behind Kevin.]

CHEF
Hello there, children.

ALL FOUR
Hey, Chef.

CARTMAN
You've got stinky britches. Stinky sti-


CHEF
What did you say??

KYLE
He's singin' some new hit song.

CHEF
Eric? Wwhere did you hear that song?


CARTMAN
It's all over the place: on the radio,
MTV, everywhere.

CHEF
Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas.


KYLE
What, dude??

CHEF
Children, I wrote that song twenty years
ago!

CARTMAN
You wrote it?

CHEF
Yeah! Back when I used to be in the
rock business. And now it looks like
some big record company has published
one of my songs.

KYLE
Wow, then you should get money for it!


CHEF
Aw, I don't want any money. I'd just
like to see my name on the credits,
that's all.

KYLE
Then we should go to the record company.
My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me
about this stuff all the time.

CHEF
Well aalll right. Maybe I will go.
I'll play them my version of the song.


[California. Chef's song is heard]

RECORDING
Stinky britches, you've got those stinky
britches

Stinky britches, you've got- [click]

CHEF
Well, you see, Mr. Big Record Producer,
"Stinky Britches" was something I wrote
several years ago.

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Hmmm. I really see no resemblance between
that song and "Stinky Britches" by our
artist, Alanis Morissette.

CHEF
Huh??

KYLE
It's the same goddamned song!

CHEF
Now, look. I'm tryin' to be cool about
this! But you just can't rip people's
music off! It's against the law!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I am above the law!!  Mr. Chef, I'm
afraid you leave me no alternative.
We're going to sue you.

CHEF
Sue me?! You stole one of my songs,
and you are going to sue me?!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer.
We'll have the best in the business.


KYLE
We'll get my dad to be Chef's lawyer!


CARTMAN
Yeah, and he's Jewish!

[Mr. Garrison's house. Some music is heard. Mr. Garrison is watching
MTV, apparently, and he still has a picture of Mr. Hat on his
bookshelf]

ALANIS
Stinky stinky britches, stinky britches


MR. GARRISON
Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mi, Mr. Twig?
AAAAA! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this
to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!

[a courthouse. All parties are present, including a black lawyer
for Mr. Big Record Producer]

KYLE'S FATHER
Now, just let me do all the talking,
Chef. We're going to bring these batards
down!

CHEF
Right.

JUDGE MOSES
This court is now in session. Who is
representing the defense?

KYLE'S FATHER
I am, your honor. Gerald Broflovski.


JUDGE MOSES
And representing the prosecution?

PROSECUTOR
I am, your honor. Johnny Cochran.

SOME OBSERVERS
Ooo.

KYLE'S FATHER
Uh oh.

CHEF
Why 'Oh oh'?

KYLE'S FATHER
Chef, that's Johnny Cochran. Huh, he's
the one that got O.J. off.

CHEF
Oh oh.

[Hell's Pass Hospital]

MR. GARRISON
I need some help over here! Please
help! I think he's got third-degree
burns!

DR. DOCTOR
Give the child to me.

MR. GARRISON
Is he goin' to be all right, doctor?!


DR. DOCTOR
Uuh.

MR. GARRISON
Is he goin' to live?!

DR. DOCTOR
 It's a stick.

MR. GARRISON
Damn it! Don't give me that medical
jargon, just tell me straight! Is he
goin' to be okay?!

[A TV shows a reporter in front of the courthouse. The boys are
at Cartman's house, watching the report. Cartman is eating Cheesy
Poofs, as usual]

REPORTER
And so, on this fifteenth day of what
is considered to be the most important
trial of the day, Johnny Cochran has
appeared to defend Capitalist Records.
The question now is, will Cochran use
his famous "Chewbacca" defense?

CARTMAN
What's a Chewbacca defense?

KYLE
I don't know.

STAN
That's what Cochran used in the O.J.
Simpson trial.

CARTMAN
God-damned, I hate that Cochran guy.
If he was here in front of me, I'd be
like, "Ay! You stupid son of a bitch,
you d-. I b-. I'ma I'm gonna kick you
in the nuts!"

KYLE
I'm sure that would scare the hell out
of him, Cartman.

KYLE'S FATHER
And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, you've heard the version
of my client's song recorded over twenty
years ago. You've heard the EXACT SAME
song produced by these cheats in the
past month . I'd say it's pretty much
an open-and-shut case. Make the right
decision. Thank you.  I've got 'em.


JUDGE MOSES
Mr. Johnny Cochran, your closing arguments.


COCHRAN
Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed
jury, Chef's attorney would certainly
want you to believe that his client
wrote "Stinky Britches" ten years ago.
And they make a good case. Hell, I almost
felt pity myself. But ladies and gentlemen
of this supposed jury, I have one, final,
thing I want you to consider.  Ladies
and gentleman, this is Chew-bacca.
Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet
Kashyyyk, but Chewbacca LIVES on the
planet Endor. Now think about that.
That does NOT MAKE SENSE.

KYLE'S FATHER
Damn it!

CHEF
What?

KYLE'S FATHER
He's using the Chewbacca defense!


COCHRAN
Why would a Wookie, an eight-foot tall
Wookie, want to live on Endor, with
a bunch of two-foot tall Ewoks? That
does NOT MAKE SENSE!  But more important,
you have to ask yourself: What does
this have to do with this case? Nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing
to do with this case! It does NOT MAKE
SENSE! Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending
a major record company, and I'm talkin'
about Chewbacca! Does that make sense?
Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making
any sense! None of this makes sense!
And so you have to remember, when you're
in that jury room deliberatin' and conjugatin'
the Emancipation Proclamation,  does
it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen
of this supposed jury, it does NOT MAKE
SENSE! If Chewbacca lives on Endor,
you must acquit! The defense rests.


JUDGE MOSES
Oh-kay then.

CARTMAN
Wow, he's good.

REPORTER
In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnny Cochran
has just finished his closing arguments,
and, as was anticipated, he did use
the Chewbacca defense  Whether or not
it worked, is up to the jury to decide.


JUDGE MOSES
How find you, the jury?

JURY FOREMAN
We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef"
McElroy, guilty as charged.

SOME OBSERVERS
Ooo.

KYLE'S FATHER
Woops.

CHEF
Woops?!

JUDGE MOSES
Mr. Chef, you've been found guilty of
harassing a major record label. The
full fee of $2 million will be handed
over within twenty-four hours.

CHEF
Do I look like I have $2 million?

JUDGE MOSES
Well, you have twenty-four hours to
find it, or else you'll have to go to
jail. For eight million years!

BAILIFF
Uh, sir, it's for four years.

JUDGE MOSES
Oh. Sorry. You'll go to jail for four
years.

CHEF
This can't be happening!

STAN
Oh no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.


[Chef's house. Everything is being repossessed. He has more than
one sofa. He's leafing through a "Memories" photo album. Mr.
Big Record Producer enters]

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
And that chair, too. I want that chair.


CHEF
Ey, that's my favorite chair!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
You heard the judge: since you lost
the case, I can seize whatever I want
to pay my legal fees.  Yeah, take that
water cooler, too.

STAN
Hello there, Chef.

CHEF
Hey, children.

KYLE
What's goin' on?

CHEF
Children, that record company guy is
takin' all my belongings. And if I don't
come up with $2 million, I'm goin' to
jail.

STAN
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer
you up.

KYLE
Yeah. Ready, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Ready!


I will do the German daunce for you.

It's fun and gay and tra-la-la

I hope you will enjoy my daunce

Feedly-I feedly-I ay.


"Would you like some sauerkraut

German boy, German boy?"

"Yes I'd like some sauerkraut.

CHEF
Okay okay, childrem, thank you very
much. I feel much better.

STAN
You do?

CHEF
Sure, sure. Just please, stop.

CARTMAN
See? I told you guys it would work.


KYLE
What's that, dude?

CHEF
This? This is my photo album of all
my times in the rock business.

KYLE
Did you ever know any famous people?


CHEF
Did I?  Janis Joplin, the Beatles, Elton
John. I got to travel all around the
world, hangin' out with bands, goin'
to lavish parties , lovin' many, many
women .

CARTMAN
What's that?

CHEF
Nothin' . Anyway-

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Take that, too.

CHEF
Heeyy! That has no monetary value! What
the hell are you takin' that for?


MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I can take whatever I want.

CHEF
Well, I have twenty-four hours to come
up with your money! That's the law!


MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I AM ABOVE THE LAW!  I told you not
to mess with me!

CHEF
That does it! You know what I'm gonna
do? I'm gonna raise that $2 million,
but I'm NOT gonna use it to pay you
back! I'm goin' to use it to hire Johnny
Cochran myself, and sue you!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
You wouldn't.

CHEF
Watch me! Now, GET THE FUDGE OUT OF
MY HOUSE!

[Mr. Garrison's house. Mr. Twig lies in bed]

MR. GARRISON
Hoh, I brought you some more juice,
Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?
Huh-I don't know who would want to hurt
you like this, but I promise nobody
will ever hurt you again, ever.  Mr.-
Mr. Twig? Are you okay? Mr.- Mr. Twig?
AAAAA! MR. TWIG IS BROKEN IN HALF!!
WHO DID THIS?! YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH
THIS, YOU BASTARDS!!

[Chef's house. The boys are still visiting. Chef is on the phone]


CHEF
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran.  Well,
Johnny Cochran will take my case if
I can pay his legal fee: $2 million.


STAN
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous
people you used to know for money? They're
rich.

CHEF
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I
did was cook for them.

KYLE
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll
help you.

CHEF
Uh I appreciate that, children, but
raisin' $2 million is not an easy thng
to do.  My only hope is to whore myself
to every woman in town.  Wish me luck,
children.

STAN
Agh. We've gotta help him, dude.

KYLE
Yeah but, but how?

STAN
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will
remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!


[The boys take an AA plane to England, where they look for Elton
John]

KYLE
Whoa, dude, this house is huge!

STAN
Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass!


CARTMAN
No it isn't, you guys.

BUTLER
Can I help you?

CARTMAN
We've come to raise money for our friend,
Chef.  Would you like a Nilla Crunchy,
or a Snacky Cake?

KYLE
Are you Elton John?

BUTLER
No, I'm one of his butlers.

KYLE
Ogh. Then what the hell are we talking
to you for?! Come on, guys.  Hi. Are
you Elton John?

ELTON
Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you
know.

KYLE
We're trying to raise money for our
school chef.

CARTMAN
We have Chocolate Noogies, and Nilla
Crunchies-

ELTON
I'm sorry. Bu' I'm not a big candy bar
fan.

CARTMAN
What?!

STAN
Could you buy a couple anyway? Our friend,
Chef is really-

ELTON
Chef! You mean, 'Chef' Chef?

KYLE
Yeah, dude.

STAN
Wow, do you remember him?

ELTON
Of course! I haven't seen him in so
long. I remember when I first met him.
It was about 25 years ago. I was just
a struggling musician , and couldn't
get a break.

ELTON



Oh oh, you're my cheddar cheese girl

You're soft but firm, and you go well with wine

Oh oh, cheddar cheese girl

Cheddar, cheddar cheese girl


[people boo and start throwing food at him. He goes backstage]


CHEF
Hey, Elton. Don't feel so down, baby.
Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll
cheer you up.

ELTON
Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand
what my music is missing.

CHEF
Look, Elton. You are a great singer,
but a retarded monkey could write better
lyrics.

ELTON
I really thought I had it this time
with "Cheddar Cheese Girl."

CHEF
What you need is a guy to write realy
good lyrics for you. I know a guy named
Bernie Taupin who's workin' at Moth
Burger right now. I'll give him a call.


ELTON
That's a great idea!

CHEF
And Elton. Why don't you get yourself
some new threads? You know. Some slick
trousers and shit.

ELTON
And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics.
And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never've
had a career in music.

STAN
So will you buy some of our candy bars
to help him out?

ELTON
Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy
Yum-Yums.

CARTMAN
Three Crispy Yum-Yums.

STAN
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics,
will you write a song for my girlfriend,
Wendy?

ELTON
Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive
worldwide rights,  including but not
limited to Asian territories, with a
20% commission from all domestic sales,
and sole ownership of any and all publishing.


STAN
'Kay.

ELTON
Tell Chef I said 'hi.'

STAN
Thanks, dude.

KYLE
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in
no time!

[The Broflovski house. Chef is in bed with Sheila as she smokes.
Kyle's picture is on one nightstand]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, thank you, Chef.

CHEF
No problem, Mrs. Broflovski. Uuh, now,
about that hundred bucks?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Eh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving
so soon?

CHEF
I've got a loohohohohohohohohong way
to go to raise the kind of money I need.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Well, best of luck to you then.

KYLE'S FATHER
How was it, honey?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Pretty much what I expected.

[The boys stand before another house, and Kyle knocks. The boys
now pull a money meter around on a red cart. The door opens]


STAN
Hello? Are you Meatloaf?

MEATLOAF
Yeah. What the hell do you want?

CARTMAN
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars
for our dying friend.

KYLE
He's not dying, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Shut your goddamned mouth!  We have
Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars.

MEATLOAF
What's this for?

STAN
Our friend, Chef.

MEATLOAF
Chef's in trouble?

KYLE
Yeah. Do you know him?

MEATLOAF
Do I?

COUS-COUS
Nobody came again.

CHEF
There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all
right. Maybe you just need to change
your image.

COUS-COUS
What do you mean?

CHEF
Nobody wants to see a guy called Cous-Cous.
You need a big, strong, beefy name.


COUS-COUS
Beefy, like uuuuh Tri-tip!

CHEF
Aw, that's not bad. Here, have some
meatloaf.

MEATLOAF
I owe eveything to Chef.

STAN
Wow. So you'll help him?

MEATLOAF
You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum-Yum's
and a couple of Berry Bars.

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Cool!

KENNY
(Hooray!)

[Ms. Crabtree's house. Chef is in bed with her]

MS. CRABTREE
All right, let's get this show on the
road! Come 'ere, puppy!

CHEF
Uh, uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree.
How would you like to use some sex
toys?

MS. CRABTREE
Sex toys? Like what?

CHEF
Like this very special device.  I call
it "Chef's Pleasure Bag."

MS. CRABTREE
How does it work?

CHEF
Now, all you do is put this paper bag
over your head, and it increases your
sexual pleasure.

MS. CRABTREE
Really? Well, hell, let's give it a
shot.

CHEF
Aaah, yeah. That's much better.

[The boys visit Rick James]

RICK
Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give
me a box of those Choco-Numbers.


KYLE
Gosh. Thanks, Rick James.

STAN
Yeah, thanks.  That's $35 dollars. Come
on, you guys. We've gotta hurry and
give this money to Chef!

[City Hall. Chef and the Mayor are in her bed]

THE MAYOR
Ohoho, that was wonderful, Chef. Good
show!

CHEF
I can't keep doin' this. It's killin'
me!

THE MAYOR
Ugh, come on, buck up, little fella.


CHEF
I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.


THE MAYOR
Sure you are, Chef. I'll give you a
hundred more for another romp!  Aw,
hell!

[Mr. Garrison's house. Officer Barbrady enters]

MR. GARRISON
Thanks for coming, Officer Barbrady!


OFFICER BARBRADY
What's this all about?

MR. GARRISON
These pictures just arrived. I set up
a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant
red-handed! Now, go arrest 'im!  What??


OFFICER BARBRADY
Can I go now?

MR. GARRISON
Yes. Yes, uh-I'm sorry.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Weirdo.

MR. GARRISON
It can't be. These can't be right.
Mr. Hat!!

[the boys go to Chef's house. Three police cars are there. The
boys walk in to see Chef being cuffed]

STAN
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

CHEF
It's over, children. I couldn't raise
the $2 million to hire Johnny Cochran,
and now I have to go to jail.

STAN
No you don't.

CHEF
Huh?

KYLE
We went to a bunch of rock stars and
sold them candy bars to raise the moeny
you needed.

CHEF
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?


KYLE
Cartman?

CARTMAN
Well, you can see here that we raised
approximately $95, falling well short
of our $2 million goal illustrated here.


CHEF
Ooh.

KYLE
But we can put our money together with
the money you made whoring yourself
to all the women. How much did you make?


CHEF
I made about $410,300, but-

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
That doesn't matter, because that money
belongs to me!

STAN
You can't take Chef's money! That illeg-!


MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
I AM ABOVE THE LAW!

OFFICER
All right, you. It's time to go!

CHEF
Good-bye, children. Thanks for all your
help.

OFFICER
Let's go.

CHEF
Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!


OFFICER
I don't tell you how to do your job,
don't tell me how to do mine!

CHEF
Ow!  Ow!

KYLE
Dude, Chef is gone.

STAN
No more Chef.

CARTMAN
No more Salisbury steak and pecan pie.


STAN
We can't let him down, you guys.

KYLE
Dude, it's over. He's gone.

STAN
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How
many times has Chef gotten us out of
trouble?

CARTMAN
Four.

KYLE
But what are we gonna do?

STAN
It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.

KYLE
Chef Aid?

STAN
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman
do the German Dance. Then we charge
people for tickets.

KYLE
Hey, that's a great idea!

CARTMAN
Yeah!

[Mr. Garrison's house. He paces back and forth in front of Mr.
Hat, seated in the armchair]

MR. GARRISON
Did you think I would just take you
back? Like you can just, walk out and
then, come back like nothing happened?
Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr.
Hat. Remember, you're the one that left!
And I'm NOT goin' to take you back!
You can just go to hell!  You go to
hell and you die!  You are a lying ball
of turd, Mr. Hat!!  I hope you starve,
you lousy son of a bitch!!  What are
you all looking at? This is just between
me and Mr. Hat.

DR. DOCTOR
It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it.
We've had enough.

MR. GARRISON
Wuwhat do you mean?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I'm afraid it's the big house for you,
fruitcake.

MR. GARRISON
What?! Jail??

[Chef Aid. Fanfare.]

CARTMAN



I will do the German daunce for you.

It's fun and gay and tra-la-la

I hope you will enjoy my daunce

Feedly-I feedly-I ay.


[some folks stop by, then leave]

KYLE
Hmm. This isn't going over so well.


STAN
Cartman just needs to put more into
it  Dance better, Cartman!

CARTMAN



"Would you like some sauerkraut

German boy, German boy?"

"Yes I'd like some sauerkraut.

Boy, I'm hungry!"


[a white limousine pulls up]

ELTON
Howdy ho, boys!

STAN
Elton John. What are you doing here?


ELTON
It occured to me that you might need
some more help raising money for Chef.


STAN
Boy, do we!

ELTON
So I called a few friends, and we all
decided to come over.

KYLE
Wow, cool!

ELTON
I see you've got a stage all set up
for us.

STAN
Yeah, dude. It's all yours!

ELTON
Then, let's rock and roll! Or something
simlar.

CARTMAN, KENNY
Hooray!

[South Park Police Dept. Chef and Garrison now share the same
cell]

MR. GARRISON
And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no
idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I
care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat
and I have so much history.

CHEF
You've finally snapped, huh, Garrison?


MR. GARRISON
What?

CHEF
Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all
you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've
got split personalities schizophrenic
jeebies.

MR. GARRISON
I warn you, Chef! Don't even think
of taking advantage of me in this prison
cell!

CHEF
What??

[back at Chef Aid. The stage has been reworked with the addition
of PA system, drums, floodlights, spotlights]

TEEN MC
Okay. Thanks for coming to Chef Aid,
everybody! Are you ready to rock and
roll?!  Woo!  All right, let's get things
going with Rancid!!  Ran-cid!

RANCID
California sun has sunk

But Amana mailed, she'll come tonight

I wish I were junk-


[people begin to jump to the music and buy tickets]

[back in jail]

MR. GARRISON
You still aren't entertaining any ideas
of raping me here in this prison cell,
are you, Chef?

CHEF
No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!

MR. GARRISON
Well that's good.

CHEF
What the?!

MR. GARRISON
Oh boy, we're free!  Wow, what a daring
rescue!  Mr. Hat!  Mr. Hat saved us,
Chef!  Come on, let's get in the truck!
I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.

CHEF
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?


[Chef Aid. Rick James has just ended a song. The group is now
a crowd, cheering the music]

RICK
Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm.

TEEN MC
Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!

RICK
God bless you, Chef!

TEEN MC
And now here's your favorite band, Primus!
Woo!

LES CLAYPOOL
We're damned proud to be here to support
our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who
told us in the early days, to keep trying
and to keep pursuing our dreams, no
matter how much we sucked. I love that
man.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Wooo!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
What are you bastards doing?

KYLE
We are raising money so that Chef can
hire Johnny Cochran to sue you!

CARTMAN
Yeah, now get out of here before I kick
you in the nuts!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Oh yeah? We'll just see about this!


TEEN MC
Now here's Joe Strummer! Wooo-hoo!


JOE
You know, in the Classroom Tour, we
lost a beat. Chef would be like it was
so offstage going, "Don't forget. Pump
your loins, children."  You know, it
was like his mo'o, or something.

TEEN MC
Woo!

JOE
Well it's a rockin' world, make no mistake
about it

It's a shockin' world, could be what's so great about it

[The truck pulls up and Chef exits]


It's a rockin' world, there ain't nothing fake abou-

CHEF
What the hell is this?

THE CROWD
Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef.

STAN
Wow, how'd you get out of jail, Chef?


CHEF
Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did
you do this?

KYLE
Well, we helped.

STAN
We're gonna raise your money, Chef.


CHEF
I don't believe it!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
We'll just see how long this Chef Aid
thing lasts!

TEEN MC
And now, here he is. TV's Ozzy Osbourne!


OZZY
We're all here to help our good friend,
Chef, who has touched our lives in the
past.  I remember when I was just starting
out. Chef suggested I buy a pompadour
hat. I thought he said, "bite the head
off a bat," so I did. And the rest,
oh, it's just history. Now, let's go
freakeeee!


Ain't nowhere to run (come everybody let's)

[the producer continues sawing. Two of the supports are gone]


Ain't nowhere to hide (come on!)


[picks up Kenny and bites into him] Arrrrrrrrgh

KENNY
(All right dude, let me go now)

Ozzy	[looks up with a bloody mouth] Yaahhhh! [Kenny's head is
missing. The music dies down]

STAN
Oh my God, Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny's
head off!

KYLE
You bastard!

TEEN MC
And now here's Ween!

DEAN
We're proud to be a part of Chef Aid.


GENE
Chef is the guy who told us to do a
country album.

DEAN
Whoa, dude, that was Steve's idea.


GENE
Oh, then. Who's Chef?

DEAN
I don't know, dude. I though you knew
him.

GENE
Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!


WEEN
Many colors in my homo rainbow

Don't be afraid to let your colors shine

MR. GARRISON
Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though
Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm
still gonna stick with you.

MR. TWIG
Do you love him?

MR. GARRISON
It doesn't matter. He left me.

MR. TWIG
Do you love him?

MR. GARRISON
Yes.

MR. TWIG
Then run to him.

MR. GARRISON
But I feel like I'd be making the wrong
decision.

MR. TWIG
Love isn't a decision, it's a feeling.
If we could decide who we love, it would
be much simpler, but much less magical.


MR. GARRISON
I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank
you.

TEEN MC
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton
John! Woo!

ELTON
Thank you all for coming to help Chef.
This is a song written by a veerry special
little boy  I have no idea what his
name is. Agh, who the hell cares? Anyway,
he wrote it for his girlfriend.


Wake up, Wendy. Smell the coffee

[Wendy smiles and looks over at Stan. Stan looks baack]

KYLE
Dude, that's your song for Wendy!

CARTMAN
Ha haa, you're a wuss.

ELTON
You know I do want you

Your flavors smell of peanuts peanuts peanuts

[the record producer saws yet another support, and this one brings
the stage down, with Elton still on it. The lights go out, and
the audience is stunned]

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Haa ha ha ha ha. I win. You lose! Chef
Aid is over, and you didn't raise near
enough money to pay Cochran's legal
fees. Ha hahaha I win!

VOICE OVER
And what happened then? Well, in South
Park they say , Johnny Cochran's heart
grew three sizes that day.

COCHRAN
Wait!  Mr. Chef, this music has really
touched me. I'd like to take up your
case, free of charge!

CHEF
You will?

COCHRAN
I will.

CROWD
YEA!!

MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
No!

COCHRAN
We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer.


MR. BIG RECORD PRODUCER
Nooooooooooo!

[Back to the courthouse. Cochran now prosecutes for Chef, and
the record producer has a new lawyer. The boys are now among
the obssrvers]

COCHRAN
Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed
jury, you must now decide whether or
not to reverse the decision for my client,
Chef.  I know he seeems guilty, but
ladies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca.
Now think about that for one minute:
that does NOT MAKE SENSE! Why am I talkin'
about Chewbacca when a man's life is
on the line?  Why? I tell you why. I
don't know. It doesn't make sense. If
Chewbacca does not make sense, you must
acquit!  Here, look at the monkey. Look
at the silly monkey.

[The courthouse doors open and Chef emerges, with the four boys
behind him. Reporters gather around him]

REPORTER
Chef? How does it feel to be a free
man and finally have your name credited
on the song, "Stinky Britches"?

CHEF
It feels greaheet! I just can't fuhind
the words to thank all the artists who
put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I
want to thank the children.

REPORTER
So, what are you gonna do now?

CHEF
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday!
And that means tomorrow is Tuna Casserole
Day.

THE BOYS
Hooray!

SOUTH PARK

Episode 102

"WEIGHT GAIN 4000"

By

Matt Stone & Trey Parker



INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

The children all sit waiting for school to begin. Some kids
are still milling about and taking off their coats.

KYLE
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow
this morning?

STAN
Yeah, it was huge!

CARTMAN
Oh, I hate those things.

The kids all look at Cartman puzzlingly.

KYLE
Nobody HATES rainbows.

STAN
Yeah, what's there to HATE about
rainbows?!

CARTMAN
Well, you know... You'll just be
sitting there minding your own
business, and they'll come marching
in and crawl up your leg and start
biting the inside of your ass -

Cartman makes gnashing sounds with his teeth.

CARTMAN
And you'll be all like 'Hey get out
of my ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!!!

The boys sit in silence for several seconds... Nobody knows
what to say... Finally Stan speaks.

STAN
Cartman, what the HELL are you talking
about?!?!

CARTMAN
I'm talking about rainbows! I hate
those friggin' things.

KYLE
Rainbows are little arches of color
that show up during a rainstorm!

Cartman thinks long and hard.

CARTMAN
Ohhhhhh.... RAINBOWS. Oh yeah, I
like those, those are cool.

Stan, Kyle and Kenny stare at Cartman in disbelief.

STAN
What were YOU talking about?!

CARTMAN
Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.

KYLE
No! What marches in, crawls up your
leg and bites the inside of your
ass?!

CARTMAN
Nothing....

Just then, Mr. Garrison steps in front of the class.

MR. GARRISON
Children! Children! remember the
'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay
contest that you children worked so
hard on last month?

The kids don't seem to remember.

MR. GARRISON
One of our VERY OWN South Park
students has won the national prize!!

The kids all gasp. Stan's face lights up.

WENDY
WOW! I knew I would win!

Garrison pulls an envelope out of his pocket.

MR. HAT
Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is
exciting!

MR. GARRISON
That's right, Mr. Hat. The winner of
the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet'
contest is... ERIC CARTMAN!!

Stan's expression drops.

WENDY
(Shocked)
WHAT?!

CARTMAN
(Just as shocked)
What?!

MR. GARRISON
Congratulations, Eric, on writing
the award winning paper.

CARTMAN
Kick ass.

STAN
That's impossible!! Cartman doesn't
know a rain forest from a pop-tart!

CARTMAN
Yeah I do, Pop-Tarts are frosted.

MR. GARRISON
Out of over a MILLION papers, Eric's
was chosen as the grand prize winner!

KYLE
Wow, what did you write about,
Cartman?

CARTMAN
(Not remembering)
Oh... You know... This and that.

WENDY
He doesn't even KNOW what he wrote
about!

KYLE
What was your paper about, Wendy?

WENDY
MY paper was on the suffering of
bottle-nosed dolphins.

CARTMAN
Well you see? You shouldn't have
written a paper about dolphins.
Dolphins are stupid.

STAN
Dude, Dolphin's are like the second
smartest animal on the planet!

CARTMAN
(Guffawing smugly)
Oh, right... If they're so damn smart
how come they get caught in those
fishing nets all the time?!

WENDY
What?!

MR. GARRISON
Wait, wait there's more! It says
here that Eric's trophy will be
presented to him by...
(Pause, gulp)
Kathie LEE GIFFORD!

The whole class gasps.

KYLE
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?

MR. GARRISON
And the presentation will be on
national television!

TRACK into Stan, Kyle and Kenny as their eyes bulge out and
their smiles widen.

KYLE AND STAN AND KENNY
Television?

MR. GARRISON
(Quietly, to himself)
Kathie Lee Gifford... I don't believe
it...

INT. SOUTH PARK CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

The intense female MAYOR MCDANIELS of South Park is pacing
excitedly up and down her office. With her are a few male
AIDES.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park...

Mayor McDaniels walks over to the window and looks out upon
the small town square.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh My God, This is our chance to
make a name for ourselves. To show
that we're not just some pissant,
whitebread mountain town!

AIDE
Better yet it's a chance for YOU to
get some publicity.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes! If I can show just how much
I've turned South Park around... I
could become a Senator!!

AIDE #2
Maybe even a STATE Senator!

AIDE
Mayor, we should decorate the town
square!

AIDE #2
Then we should have the Chef of the
school cafeteria sing a song, and
play up the ethnic diversity of our
town.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
That's right... He's a black guy
isn't he?

AIDE
(Proudly)
Black as the night itself, Mayor.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
(triumphantly)
YES!! And we can even have the
children of South Park put on a little

AIDE
Thank You

INT. CAFETERIA

The boys are eating lunch at a table in the cafeteria.

CARTMAN
You guys, guess what... After I'm on
television, I'm gonna be totally
famous!

Wendy walks by.

WENDY
Hitler was famous too.

Wendy leaves. Chef comes sliding in.

CHEF
Hello there children!

KIDS
Hey Chef.

CHEF
How are my little crackers today?

KIDS
Good.

CHEF
Did you all hear about the news?!
Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South
Park!

STAN
Yeah, 'cause Cartman cheated and won
the environmental essay contest.

CARTMAN
Hey!!!

CHEF
Yeah, Yeah, whatever, but the Mayor
just called and asked ME to sing at
the ceremony!

KYLE
Wow, are you gonna do it?

CHEF
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful,
sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And
if I sing to her, maybe I can lure
her into a night of exotic
delectation.

STAN
Yeah! That'd be cool!

KENNY
Mph rmph rm!

CHEF
Well, THREE times bigger than Frank
Gifford's anyway.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Garrison sits at the front of an empty classroom grading
some papers.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, I can't even concentrate on
grading papers with all this
excitement!

Mr. Hat sits lifeless on a chair near the desk.

MR. GARRISON
Why are you looking at me like that,
Mr. Hat?

Garrison picks the puppet up.

MR. HAT
Have you forgotten about all the
pain and suffering that Kathy Lee
Gifford caused you?

MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago,
and I was only a child.

MR. HAT
We could have WON that talent show...
We could have been huge!

TRACK IN ON GARRISON

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY - FLASHBACK

A large banner reads 'National Talent Show Finals'

TILT DOWN from the banner and onto -

A smaller, ten year-old version of Mr. Garrison stands in a
huge spotlight on stage, with a smaller Mr. Hat on his arm.

LIL' MR. GARRISON
Knock, knock, Mr. Hat.

MR. HAT
Who's there?

LIL' MR. GARRISON
Orange.

MR. HAT
Orange who?

LIL' MR. GARRISON
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

MR. HAT
Thank you.

A smattering of applause echoes in the auditorium. Mr.
Garrison and Mr. Hat both bow and walk off stage. Several
judges hold up their numbers - 8.9, 9, 7.8, 9.2

LIL' MR. GARRISON
Wow, Mr. Hat, it looks like we might
win!

LOUDSPEAKER
'And now our last Talent Show
Finalist: Kathie Lee Epstein!!!'

A very young, cute Kathy Lee steps onto the stage, looking
adorable.

LIL' KATHIE LEE
(singing)
...If... they... could... See me now
that little gang of mine, I'm eating
fancy chow and drinking fancy
wine..... ! How they would all say
WOW!

ZOOM OUT to reveal Lil' Kathie Lee Gifford singing and dancing
with a fifteen piece band and about 100 dancers all
choreographed in utter harmony with her every move. WHOOSH!
She now wears a puppet on each hand. Amazingly she manages
to throw her voice to each puppet and continue singing
herself, all in perfect harmony.

LIL' KATHIE LEE
(singing)
If my friends could see me now...

Kathie Lee is putting on a SPECTACULAR Broadway musical
number. Fountains go off! Fireworks explode!

Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat watch on, dumbfounded.

LIL' KATHIE LEE
IF MY FRIENDS COULD SEE... ME...
NOOOOOOOOOOWWWWwww!!!!

The crowd ERUPTS with applause. The judges hold up their
numbers 10! 10! 10! 10!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. Garrison sits with glazed-over eyes.

MR. GARRISON
It wasn't fair, she had choreography.
How could we compete with that?

MR. HAT
But now she's coming to South Park...
And I know a way to make it ALL
better!

MR. GARRISON
How?

Mr. Hat whispers in Garrison's ear. Garrison GASPS!

MR. GARRISON
No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't!!

TRACK IN on Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
I couldn't... KILL Kathie Lee Gifford!

DRAMATIC MUSIC AND FADE OUT:

INT. CLASSROOM - AFTER LUNCH

Mayor McDaniels stands in front of the children.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Children, as you all know, Ms. Kathie
Lee Gifford will be in South Park to
present the award to some kid for an
essay.

CARTMAN
That kid is me!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you
Luscious little youngsters do a play
about the history of South Park.

MR. GARRISON
That'll be wonderful! Won't it Mr.
Hat?

MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
KILL HER!

MR. GARRISON
Mr. Hat!!!!

Garrison quickly puts his hand over Mr. Hat's mouth. The
Mayor looks oddly at Garrison and then continues.

The mayor turns to Mr. Garrison.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct
our little play.

MR. GARRISON
Oh that's PERFECT!
(To Mr. Hat)
You see, Mr. Hat? We don't have to
KILL her, we can just UPSTAGE her!

WENDY
Mrs. Mayor? You might want to review
the essays. We think Cartman might
have cheated.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Who cares? Now kids, what say we
give it our South Park best?!

The Mayor waits for the kids to cheer. They don't.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
And who's our little prize winner
again?

CARTMAN
(Pissed off)
ME!! ERIC CARTMAN!!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
How about we get in shape, huh? We
want to look our best for the T.V.
cameras don't we?

CARTMAN
Yes ma'am!
(Singing)
I'm gonna be on television! I'm gonna
be on television!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

The school bus drops the boys off at their bus stop. Cartman
is STILL singing the same song.

CARTMAN
(Singing)
I'm gonna be on television! I'm gonna
be on television!

Stan gets in Cartman's face.

STAN
We don't believe for a minute that
you won that contest fairly, fat
boy!

CARTMAN
Hey, stop defending your little
girlfriend for writing about some
stupid fish.

STAN
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and
friendly!!

CARTMAN
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread
with some mayonnaise.

STAN
Dolphins are way smarter than YOU!

CARTMAN
If they're so smart, why do they
live in igloos?!

STAN
DOLPHINS DON'T LIVE IN IGLOOS! THAT'S
ESKIMOS!!

CARTMAN
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares? It's
all a bunch of tree-hugging hippie
crap!

STAN
Tell me what you wrote about!!

CARTMAN
Uh, I can't, I have to go home and
get in shape!

Cartman walks away.

STAN
Yeah right, you'll go sit in front
of the T.V. and eat Cheesy Poofs,
assmaster!

CARTMAN (OFFSCREEN)
Screw you, hippie!!

INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE

Cartman sits on the couch watching television and eating
Cheesy Poofs. He plunges his hand into the huge barrel of
Cheesey Poofs that sits beside him.

ANGLE - TELEVISION ANNOUNCER

We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals after this. A bunch of
muscle-builder guys stand around flexing.

NARRATOR
HEY! DO YOU NEED TO GET IN SHAPE
FAST?!

This catches Cartman's attention - his eyes dart to the
screen.

NARRATOR
Wanna look your best? Tired of all
the OTHER guys getting all the chicks?

Cartman turns up the volume on the remote.

NARRATOR
Are you tired of being a ninety-pound
weakling?

A scrawny little guy gets punched in the face by a big, buff
muscle-builder.

CARTMAN
Yeah! I only weigh ninety pounds!

NARRATOR
Then bulk up QUICK with Weight Gain
4000.

The narrator flexes and muscles bulge out all over. Cartman's
eyes light up.

CARTMAN
YES!

CARTMAN
Mom, can you get me some WEIGHT GAIN

CARTMAN'S MOM
O.K. Eric, I'll get you some at the

CARTMAN
But mom I need it for tomorrow.

CARTMAN'S MOM
But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.

CARTMAN
MOM.......

CARTMAN'S MOM
O.K., O.K. Well I guess I'll be going
to the store now then.

Cartman's mom pulls her purse on and heads out the door.

INT. MR. GARRISON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Garrison is lying in bed, tossing and turning from a terrible
nightmare. We see whispy images floating through Garrison's
thoughts -

Finally, Garrison awakes, and jolts up to a sitting position.

MR. GARRISON
NO, NO!!!!

Garrison wipes sweat from his brow, realizing it was all a
dream. Then he spots Mr. Hat in his little chair.

MR. HAT
Kill her.

MR. GARRISON
No, Mr. Hat! I won't do it!

Mr. Hat's eyes begin to glow red. Mr. Hat's head starts
spinning around and around.

MR. HAT
KILLLLLLLLLL...

MR. GARRISON
That does it. You're going in the
dresser drawer Mr. Hat.

MR. HAT
She'll make a fool of you again.

MR. GARRISON
Well, you can just stay in that drawer
Negative Nancy.

Garrison throws the puppet in his dresser and locks it with
a little key. Immediately the dresser starts shaking and
illuminating.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - THE NEXT MORNING

The sun rises over South Park.

INT. BUS STOP - MORNING

Stan, Kenny, and Kyle all stand at the busstop waiting for
the bus to show up. Cartman comes waddling up in a tank top
and holding a big tin of Weight Gain 4000.

CARTMAN
Hey dudes.

KYLE
What the hell is wrong with you,
Cartman? Haven't you noticed the
three feet of snow on the ground?

CARTMAN
Listen... I have a nice body and I
wanna show it off. You got that?

The boys take a second to digest this one.

STAN
What?! You've got to weigh ninety-
pounds!

CARTMAN
I'm up to ninety-four, thank you
very much.

KENNY
Mrmnph phh mphph?

KYLE
Yeah, they're almost as big as his
mom's!

The boys all laugh hysterically.

CARTMAN
Laugh all you want. I'm the one who's
gonna be on T.V. looking all buff.

He takes the top off the tin and starts chowing down on the
weight gain powder.

KYLE
What's that stuff?

CARTMAN
Weight Gain 4000. It's helping me
bulk up.

KYLE
Bulk up to what? Fat Ass?

STAN
Super Fat Ass?

CARTMAN
Hey! I don't have to take that kinda
crap from you scrawny weaklings!

The bus pulls up and the boys jump on. Cartman has an extra
hard time getting on the bus. He huffs and puffs toward the
door. When he reaches the door, he has to turn sideways.

CARTMAN
Sweet, check me out! I'm such a
beefcake I can't even get through
the door!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Townspeople are busy painting the buildings on the main drag
and hanging banners reading 'South Park Welcomes Kathie Lee
Gifford!!!' The mayor is directing townspeople with a
megaphone.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
C'mon people! We've got to turn this
place around!! Hang up the lights!
String up the banners! Castrate the
cows!!

The cows look up with concern.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - STAGE

Mr. Garrison's class stands around on the stage all dressed
in cute little historical outfits. Half the children are
dressed as pioneers, and the other half are dressed as
Indians. The Mayor walks up.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the little
play going?

MR. GARRISON
Huh? Oh... Fine, we were just about
to run it from the top.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, please do! I'm dying to see it!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, All the little pioneers on
this side of the stage.

All the kids who are dressed in pioneer outfits go to one
side of the stage.

MR. GARRISON
Good, and all the little Indians go
to the center of the stage.

A little boy named CLYDE steps forward.

CLYDE
Am I a Indian or a pioneer?

MR. GARRISON
Do you have a feather on your head?

CLYDE
Yes.

MR. GARRISON
Then you're an Indian.

CLYDE
Oh.

The Mayor sighs as Clyde walks to join the group of kids
dressed as Indians. Kenny is just wearing what he always
wears with a little red feather sticking out of his hood.

Now Garrison moves in front of the curtain and stands next
to the Mayor.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, BeBe this is your line.

BEBE stands in front of the curtain in a little dress.

BEBE
(Reciting loudly)
This is the story of South Park...
It begins over a hundred years ago
when the noble and hardy Ute Indians
lived on the land.

Now the curtain opens revealing all the children dressed as
Indians sitting in around a little fake teepee.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh, don't they look adorable?

BEBE
Then, from the east, came the great
white pioneers...

Suddenly, all the children who were dressed as pioneers come
CHARGING onto the stage and immediately start beating the
crap out of the kids dressed as Indians.

The Mayor watches in horror as the Indians are pummeled
senseless by the pioneers.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Oh my God!!

MR. GARRISON
They did it a lot better this morning.
They had more energy.

BEBE
The pioneers met with the Indians,
and negotiated for their fertile
lands...

The children continue to fight. All the little Indian kids
are thrown off stage and beaten to a pulp.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Garrison! We cannot have our
children beating each other senseless
in front of Kathie Lee Gifford!

MR. GARRISON
Well, what do you want? This is how
it happened in those days.

Stan kicks Clyde in the ribs repeatedly.

STAN
Take THAT you stupid Indian!

CLYDE
Ow!

Now the kids are really into it, the Mayor and Mr. Garrison
have to shout over the growing moans and cries.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
MR. GARRISON! THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE!
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT Kathie
LEE GIFFORD WOULD ENJOY THIS?!?!

MR. GARRISON
TO HELL WITH Kathie LEE
GIFFORD!!!!!!!!

Silence...

Everybody stops... The kids quit fighting and stare at Mr.
Garrison with disbelief. You could hear a pin drop.

Garrison covers his mouth and looks around as if to say he
himself can't even believe what he just said.

MR. GARRISON
Oh my God... What have I said?

South Park residents gather around looking astounded. A
ominous silence spreads throughout the square as all eyes
rest on Mr. Garrison.

TOWNSWOMAN
(gasping)
He said 'to HELL with Kathie Lee
Gifford'!

The whole town continues to stare in absolute shock. Shamed,
Mr. Garrison hangs his head.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you
from directing our play.

Mr. Garrison steps down from the stage.

INT. MR. GARRISON'S BEDROOM

Mr. Garrison unlocks his dresser drawer and slides it open.
Mr. Hat lays face up.

MR. HAT
It happened again, didn't it?

Mr. Garrison picks up Mr. Hat and puts him on his hand.

MR. HAT
Now we do things MY WAY.

MR. GARRISON
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat!
(Pause)
You're going to have to do it!

MR. HAT laughs!!!!!

FADE OUT:

ACT II

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - THE NEXT DAY

The sign at the town square reads 'Days until Kathie Lee
Arrives'. Dress rehearsal for the big event. Everyone in
South Park is making final preparations. The Mayor is
directing where everybody goes. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand
on stage in little pioneer and Indian costumes. Cartman heaves
himself up onto the platform. The platform bulges and CREEKS
under his enormous weight.

KYLE
Whoa Cartman, talk about wide load!

CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill
out nicely.

Cartman flexes his arms.

KYLE
You're not 'filling out nicely',
you're fatter than ever!

CARTMAN
I'm not fat, I'm getting in shape!

KYLE
Cartman, you're SUCH a fat ass, that
when you walk down the street people
go 'GOD DAMN IT, THAT'S A BIG FAT
ASS!'

CARTMAN
No they don't, you jealous weakling!

A RANDOM TOWNSPERSON walks by and sees Cartman.

TOWNSPERSON
God Damn, that is a big fat ass!

CARTMAN
Hey!

Wendy walks in.

WENDY
Hi guys.

CARTMAN
Oh, look, another hippie. Peace,
Wendy.

STAN
Shut up, Cartman!

CARTMAN
(Singing)
Oh, two little hippies sittin' in a
tree......!

Wendy pulls Stan aside.

WENDY
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and
get to the bottom of this!

INT. SOUTH PARK GUN SHOP - DAY

A pleasant GUNSMITH is locking some weapons behind a glass
case when he hears the little BELL announce that somebody
has come in.

JIMBO
Can I help you?

The gunsmith turns around to see Mr. Garrison, hobbled over
and wearing a long trenchcoat that covers much of his face.
He looks crazed and nervous.

MR. GARRISON
Yes... I need a gun.

JIMBO
Would this be for hunting, home-
protection or other?

MR. GARRISON
Other.

JIMBO
Alrighty, then may I suggest the
Stratford twelve millimeter. Here,
try it on.

The Gunsmith hands Garrison the large, black rifle and leads
him over to a set of mirrors, angled just like the ones in
clothing stores.

JIMBO
That looks really nice on you. The
lacquered black really matches your
eyes.

Garrison turns around and looks himself up and down.

MR. GARRISON
(To the mirror)
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to
me?
(To the Gunsmith)
I don't know... It's a little small.

JIMBO
Okay, how about this?

The Gunsmith quickly replaces the Stratford with another,
larger rifle. Again, Garrison twirls around in the mirror
with the gun in his hands.

MR. GARRISON
(To the mirror)
You talkin' to me?
(To the Gunsmith)
Mmmm, no. I don't like this one
either.

JIMBO
Here's the same gun with a wood
finish.

MR. GARRISON
You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody
else around here. So you must be
talkin' to me.

Mr. Garrison turns to the Gunsmith.

MR. GARRISON
I'll take it.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

Establishing.

INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

The classroom is dark and silent. The door CREEKS open and a
shaft of blue moonlight spills through. Wendy pokes her head
in.

WENDY
(in a whisper)
Hello?

She tiptoes to the back of the room and opens a file cabinet.
Inside is a manila envelope labeled 'Save Our Planet Essay
Contest.'

She opens the folder and flips through the papers.

She comes to her paper, which the judges have scored with a
big circled 72 written on it and the phrase 'Good Try Little
girl - But if dolphins are so smart, why do they get caught
in fishing nets all the time?'

Wendy grinds her teeth and fumes for a moment.

After a few more papers, she comes to the one with a big
blue ribbon on it. It is an incredibly thick essay, nearly
300 pages. Wendy pulls it out and starts to read it out loud.

WENDY
(Reading)
My Essay - By Eric Cartman... When I
wrote the following pages, or rather
the bulk of them, I lived alone, in
the woods on the shore of...

The door opens! Wendy shoves the paper in her jacket and
drops behind a desk.

A dark figure moves across the classroom. Wendy peeks up and
sees Mr. Garrison taking off his overcoat. He sits down at
his desk, flips on a lamp, and throws Mr. Hat on a chair.

MR. GARRISON
Well Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee
really will be surprised when she
gets here tomorrow...

Mr. Hat sits limp on the chair. Mr. Garrison starts to polish
his gun.

MR. GARRISON
She beat us in the talent show all
those years ago... And I think we
OWE her for that!

Wendy peeks out from behind the desk. Garrison points the
gun and looks through the sight.

MR. GARRISON
BANG!!!

CLICK!! Mr. Garrison dry shoots the gun. Wendy eyes grow
huge as Garrison's laughter reverberates throughout the room.

WENDY
(Softly)
Oh my God!

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - MORNING

The sign now reads 'Days Until Kathie Lee Arrives' and a
hand removes the '1' so that it reads 'TODAY!!'.

The sun rises over South Park as the whole town fills the
town square on the big day.

Kyle stands with his little brother IKE, who bounces in and
out of frame wearing a blue jumpsuit with 'I LOVE Kathie
LEE' sewed on the front.

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Garrison walks down the street holding his large, black rifle.
Some townspeople notice him, but simply smile and wave hello.

TOWNSPERSON
Howdy, Mr. Garrison, nice gun!

MR. GARRISON
Thank you.

ANOTHER TOWNSPERSON
Nice gun, Mr. Garrison!

MR. GARRISON
Thanks. Hello Officer Barbrady.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Nice gun.

MR. GARRISON
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town
where I can get a good, clear shot-a-
view of Kathie Lee?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hmm... You know, I think the book
depository would be a good bet.

WHIP PAN TO:

EXT. SOUTH PARK BOOK DEPOSITORY - DAY

The depository, a two story, wooden building, stands utterly
empty on the other side of the street. Two vultures fly in a
circle around it.

WHIP PAN BACK TO:

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - DAY

MR. GARRISON
Yes... Yes, that might do quite
nicely. Thank you, Officer Barbrady.

In a trance, Garrison slowly walks towards the depository.

OFFICER BARBRADY
No problem.

Suddenly, Barbrady rips a camera out of the hands of another
townsperson.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Ha! Caught you red handed! NO PICTURES
OF Kathie LEE!!

Barbrady grabs the guy and whisks him off.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - STAGE - DAY

The Mayor stands on the stage nervously awaiting Kathie Lee's
arrival. She checks her watch.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Where is she?

Meanwhile, the kids are backstage, getting ready for their
performance.

CARTMAN
This is sweet. The camera crews are
setting up, and I'm looking totally
ripped. Beefcake BEEFCAKE!

Cartman slurps down some more Weight Gain 4000.

KYLE
I don't think they're gonna be able
to get all of you in frame, Cartman.

Suddenly, Wendy comes running up.

WENDY
You guys! We have to stop him!!

KYLE
Stop who?

WENDY
Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to
KILL Kathie Lee Gifford!

CARTMAN
Oh no you don't! You're not gonna
ruin MY moment of fame!

WENDY
He's got a gun!

CARTMAN
You gotta get over this whole jealousy
thing alright. Seriously, just face
it, I wrote a better paper than you.

WENDY
It just so happens that I HAVE your
paper and I KNOW why you won!

Cartman panics.

WENDY
There's something more important
right now. Let's go!

STAN
Wendy, you've got to Prioritize!!
What's more IMPORTANT? Being on TV,
or some stupid assassination?!

WENDY
Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?

Wendy makes a sad face at Stan. Stan's eyes droop.

KYLE
Uh-oh, we're losing him.

EXT. STAGE - DAY

MAYOR MCDANIELS
HERE SHE COMES!!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The townspeople all cheer and wave 'Welcome' flags. The lame
South Park marching band marches down the street.

Following close behind is a vehicle that has been modified
with bullet-proof glass - just like the famous 'POPE MOBILE'.
Inside the glass bubble, waving happily is Kathie Lee Gifford.

The vehicle is also surrounded by several suited guards who
look like secret service. They are all looking around with
their fingers in their ears.

INT. SOUTH PARK BOOK DEPOSITORY - DAY

Garrison is sitting at a window of the book depository with
his gun pointing outside.

MR. GARRISON
Damn! I guess I'm not the only person
in America who's thought of killing
Kathie Lee Gifford.

EXT. SOUTH PARK TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The Pope-mobile continues down the street.

TOWNSWOMAN
WE LOVE YOU Kathie LEE!!

Kathie Lee responds, maybe she says 'I love you too', but
she is inaudible through the thick glass.

INT. SOUTH PARK BOOK DEPOSITORY - DAY

MR. GARRISON
Come on, you little bitch...

Garrison looks through the HUGE scope on his rifle.

ANGLE - GUNSIGHT

The crosshairs of the sight lie directly in front of Kathie
Lee's head. Through the sight, Garrison notices that the
trophy is inside the bubble with Kathie Lee.

RESUME - GARRISON

MR. GARRISON
You've got to come out of your
precious bubble sooner or later,
Missy.

Garrison laughs maniacally.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

The pope-mobile rides past them and finally reaches the stage.
The Mayor steps up to the microphone.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
It is with great pride and honor
that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie
Lee Gifford to South Park!

The townspeople all cheer.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
And now, our very own South Park
Elementary Chef will sing a special
song in honor of Mrs. Lee-Gifford!

Kathie Lee rolls her eyes, and then tries desperately to
look thrilled, as Chef steps up to the mic.

CHEF
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know...
Kathie-Lee, you are a very special
woman...

Groovy Isaac Hayes music starts to fade in. The BAND MEMBERS
are in the background getting funky.

CHEF
I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler-
Moore way... Or special in a extra
value meal at Happy Burger way... No
no no no-

Kathie Lee looks confused.

CHEF
I mean SPECIAL... Like... The song
of a hummingbird as it gets ready
to... to find that female hummingbird,
and -- make sweet love to it -- all
night long. Just two hummingbirds
moanin' and groanin' and letting
their bodies caress and touch each
other in ecstasy...

Now the groove breaks into a full-fledged soul song.

CHEF
(Singing)
Ooh Kathie Lee
How I'd love to lay you down
And lick every inch of your body
with my tongue.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
What???

CHEF
Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.
How 'bout you and me?

MAYOR MCDANIELS
What???

Kathie Lee is in absolute shock. The Mayor tries to stop
Chef.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
(Grabbing the mic)
Uh, thank you Chef for that
heartwarming song-

CHEF
(Still singing)
Make sweet love.....

MAYOR MCDANIELS
(in total shock)
THANK YOU, CHEF!!

The music stops. A few people applaud. Chef is hurried off
the stage.

CHEF
God bless you Kathie Lee!!

Kathie Lee waves from inside her bubble, again, trying to
look happy, but visibly uncomfortable.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Wendy and Stan frantically run through the crowd. They spot
Officer Barbrady.

WENDY TESTABURGER
Officer Barbrady! Mr. Garrison is
about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to
find him!

OFFICER BARBRADY
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a
minute...

Barbrady thinks. A thought bubble appears above him, replaying
the scene from earlier.

MR. GARRISON
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town
where I can get a good, clear shot-a-
view of Kathie Lee?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hmm... You know, I think the book
depository would be a good bet.

Barbrady keeps thinking. Wendy patiently waits. Again the
same scene plays.

OFFICER BARBRADY
I think the book depository would be
a good bet.
Book depository would be a good bet.
Book depository good bet
Book depository

Finally, Barbrady stops thinking.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Damn! He could be anywhere! I'll
send out an A.P.B.!

Barbrady dashes off. Wendy sighs.

STAN
Wendy, look!

Stan points up to the book depository where Mr. Hat is peeping
over a gun barrel that is sticking out of the second story
window. Wendy gasps and runs toward it.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - STAGE

MAYOR MCDANIELS
And now, Here to present the award
for the Environmental essay to our
own Eric Kaufman-

CARTMAN
Cartman, God Dammit!!!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
-Is your favorite celebrity and mine;
Kathie LEE GIFFORD!!!

The townspeople go nuts. Kathie Lee, still in her large
bubble, is hoisted onto the stage. The glass holder falls
over at first, but the servicemen are right there to pick
her back up.

Now Kathie Lee speaks, but the glass is so thick that we
still can't quite hear what she is saying.

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
Thank you! How I love you all!

INT. SOUTH PARK BOOK DEPOSITORY

STAN
Mr. Garrison! Stop!

Garrison spins around and sees Wendy and Stan standing in
the doorway.

MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
LEAVE US! WE MUST FINISH WHAT WE
HAVE BEGUN!

Garrison turns back to the window and again takes aim.

WENDY TESTABURGER
I know that she's hurt you, she's
hurt a lot of people.

Now Garrison turns back to Wendy with a different look.

MR. GARRISON
You... Can't know...

WENDY TESTABURGER
YOU should have won that talent show.

Stan looks confused but Garrison's face lights up.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - STAGE

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
(Still mostly inaudible)
It is with great honor and pride
that I present the winner this trophy.

Now Kathie Lee bends down and picks up the trophy. She opens
the door hatch in her bubble and takes a step out.

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
Eric, would you please come up here.

Cartman walks slowly up the stairs to the stage, fat literally
dragging behind him.

CARTMAN
Here it is! My big moment of fame!

INT. SOUTH PARK BOOK DEPOSITORY

MR. GARRISON
And then she finished it all by
throwing her voice with TWO dummies
at once.

WENDY
I know that, Mr. Garrison, but this
isn't the answer.

Garrison thinks.

MR. GARRISON
It is too late for me... Young Wendy.

WENDY
You see, I've learned something today.
You can't win all the time. And if
you don't win... You certainly can't
hold it against the person who DID,
because... That's the only way you
ever really lose.

MR. GARRISON
You're... You're right.

Garrison sets the gun down and walks toward Wendy and Stan
with a smile growing on his face.

WENDY TESTABURGER
Good...

STAN
Man, did she really throw her voice
with TWO dummies at once?

Garrison freaks.

MR. HAT
THE BITCH MUST DIE!!!

Garrison spins around, grabs the gun, and points it out the
window. The gunshot fires! BLAM!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - STAGE

Cartman steps off of the stairs and puts his weight on the
stage. The stage immediately collapses on his side, firing
Kathie Lee up into the air like a rocket.

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
AAAAGGHH!!!

Cartman falls underneath the stage as the bullet flies past
where Kathie Lee was standing - and heads directly for Kenny.

KENNY
Mm Nmm!

The bullet hits Kenny, whose poor little body goes flying
across the stage, then he lands upside down in a large barrel
of water, which immediately turns blood red.

KYLE
Oh my God! they killed Kenny!
(Shaking his fist)
You bastard!

The Secret Servicemen take action and jump all over Kathie
Lee, protecting her body from any more bullets.

SERVICEMEN
GUN!! GUN!!

The men then quickly shove Kathie Lee in her bubble and drive
away.

KYLE
Hey!! Come back!! We didn't even get
to do our play!!

But within seconds Kathie Lee is gone. Her entire entourage
disappears over the horizon.

T.V. CREW DIRECTOR
I guess that's it guys. Wrap it up.

CARTMAN
Hey, wait a minute! When do I get to
be on television?!

T.V. CREW DIRECTOR
Forget it, kid. No Kathie Lee, no
public interest.

CARTMAN
But I won the environmental essay
contest!!

Wendy Testaburger jumps onto the stage.

WENDY TESTABURGER
You don't DESERVE to win, Cartman,
and YOU know it!

Wendy steps up to the microphone and holds up a VERY thick
stack of papers.

WENDY TESTABURGER
I'm holding Cartman's award winning
paper! It's actually nothing more
than 'Walden' with Henry David
Thoreau's name crossed out and
Cartman's name written in its place!

The townspeople all look at each other. Cartman gulps.

TOWNSPERSON
Who cares?

TOWNSPERSON #2
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

The townspeople all concur and begin to disperse.

STAN
What about not holding anything
against the person who wins?

WENDY TESTABURGER
Well not if it's CARTMAN!! Hey where
are you all going?!

The townspeople all disappear, leaving the kids alone.

WENDY TESTABURGER
(Vanquished)
They don't even know what Walden is.
(Shouting again)
I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd
all know what it was!!!

STAN
Come on, Wendy. Kyle's mom'll make
us tuna fish sandwiches.

WENDY TESTABURGER
Oh, what the hell.

MAYOR
(Sobbing)
NO!! NO!! Now I'll be stuck in this
podunk town forever with all these
stupid, hick, redneck, jobless, truck
driving idiots!!

AIDE
Uh, mayor, the mic is on.

Suddenly, the doors to the book depository open, and Officer
Barbrady appears holding Mr. Garrison's left arm.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Thought you could get away with it,
eh Mr. Hat?!

MR. HAT
Well, I would have gotten away with
it if it weren't for those meddling
kids.

OFFICER BARBRADY
You're lucky you missed Kathie Lee
Gifford and that nobody got hurt.

Barbrady throws Garrison in the back seat, gets in the car
and speeds away past Kenny's little bleeding body.

The white mental hospital sits pleasantly between two mountain
peaks.

INT. SOUTH PARK MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

Mr. Garrison sits in a padded room surrounded by Kenny, Kyle,
Wendy and Stan. Mr. Hat is in a little straight jacket, but
Garrison isn't.

STAN
We hope you can come back to school
real soon, Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Well children, I'd love to. But the
doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more
therapy...

Mr. Hat pops out from the side.

MR. HAT
WE CAN STILL GET HER!! MMFF MF!!

MR. GARRISON
I'm just so sorry that I ruined
everyone's chances for being on T.V.

KYLE
Not Cartman, he get's to be on T.V.
anyway.

MR. GARRISON
Really? On what?

ANGLE - MONITOR - CARTMAN IN HIS BED

Cartman is lying on his bed with a blanket wrapped around

He needs to run his ass around the

An arm drapes over Chef. PULL BACK to reveal that Kathie Lee
is lying in bed naked next to Chef.

Mmmm, how about a little more of

"GREY DAWN"


Written by


Trey Parker





SOUTH PARK FARMER'S MARKET

[Day. A crowd is gathered under this banner and listens to Father
Maxi as he delivers a service.]

FATHER MAXI
Friends, we gather in this place to
mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy:
nine good people who were run over in
the street by an elderly woman driver.


CARTMAN
Oh God, memorial services are sooo
boring.

KYLE
You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine
people died!

CARTMAN
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies.
Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets.
Mostly

FATHER MAXI
It is sometimes hard, in times like
these, to understand God's way. Why
would he allow nine innocent people
to be run down in the prime of their
lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps,
shouldn't be driving? It is then that
we must understand, God's sense of humor
is very different from our own. He does
not laugh at the simple "man walks into
a bar" joke. No, God needs complex irony
and subtle farcical twists that seem
macabre to you and me. All that we can
hope for is that God got his good laugh
and a tragedy such as this will never
happen again.

MR. GARRISON
Look out!!

ELDERLY DRIVER
Huh? Was that a stop sign back there?
Ooooh, I think I hit a pot hole.


[Stan's house, night. The family is eating dinner - tacos, nachos,
rice, milk]

STAN
Hey Dad, how come they let old people
drive?

RANDY
Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.


STAN
But they kill people.

RANDY
Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens
have to be dealt with very gingerly,
Stan. We can't just take their licenses
away.

MARVIN
I'll be God-damned if they think they
can take my license away!

SHARON
Oooh, hi Dad.

MARVIN
I heard what you said! You wanna take
drivin' privileges away from seniors!
Well let me tell you something, peckerface!
I worked fifty five years in the steel
mill!

RANDY
Yes Dad.

MARVIN
And I flew Spitfires over Germany in
World War II!

RANDY
Yes I know.

MARVIN
And I will be God-damned if the government
thinks it can step in and take away
my right to drive!

STAN
I think old people should have rights,
Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.

[Stark's Pond, night. A lone man is fishing in the middle of
the pond. He senses something ominous and looks around. On the
road nearby, a brown Buick drives by slowly. A short old woman
is at the wheel]

ELDERLY MAN
Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest
way to Country Kitchen Buffet!

MONA
No, but it's the shortest. I save the
most gas that way.

ELDERLY MAN
You save the most gas if you take the
highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!


MONA
Less miles means less gas, you old fool.


ELDERLY MAN
There's Country Kitchen right there!


MONA
Where?

ELDERLY MAN
Right there! You're gonna miss it!


MONA
Is this the parking lot?

ELDERLY MAN
I think so.

[News 4. A splash screen shows various correspondents and anchors,
and a globe spins in front of the montage]

ANCHOR
Another death tonight by a senior citizen
motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction
was killed instantly when struck by
a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman,
who were trying to find Country Kitchen
Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only
two days after the accident in Deer
Creek, where three construction workers
and a bulldozer  were run down by senior
citizen Paul Thom , who was trying to
find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public
outcry is forcing the DMV to consider
suspending the licenses of all seniors
over seventy, though no decision has
yet to be made.

[Park County Community Center, day. The seniors have gathered
there for a meeting]

MARVIN
Seniors of South Park, I don't know
about you, but I am mad as hell!

SENIORS
Yeah!

ELDERLY WOMAN 1
I'm sick of having my mental condition
come into question!

ELDERLY MAN 1
We need to let everyone know we're
pissed off, and we're not gonna take
it anymore!

SENIORS
Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!

MARVIN
That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember
what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember
we're all pissed about something and
uh... that's why we had this meeting,
but I... can't for the life of me re-


ELDERLY WOMAN 2
Oooo. Was it the kids skateboarding
on the sidewalks? No?

ELDERLY MAN 2
Oh, I remember! They're gonna take
our licenses away!

SENIORS
Yeah! Yeah! That's right!

MARVIN
That's right! They're gonna try and
take our licenses away! And I, for one,
am mad as hell!

SENIORS
Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine
too!

ELDERLY WOMAN 1
I'm sick of having my mental condition
come into question!

MARVIN
So now, what are we gonna do about it?


ELDERLY MAN 3
Do about what?

ELDERLY WOMAN 3
They're gonna take our licenses away.


ELDERLY WOMAN 1
They are?? They can't do that!

MARVIN
That's right. So you know what I think
we should do? I think we should have
a senior citizens' meeting! Get all
the senior together a the community
center and unite!

ELDERLY MAN 3
Great idea, Marvin!

ELDERLY WOMAN 4
Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting
right now.

MARVIN
...Oh, right, this is the meeting.


ELDERLY MAN 4
Right. To get those damn kids to stop
skateboarding on the sidewalks!

SENIORS
Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's
gotta stop them!

[The Marsh house, day. Sharon and Shelley are making construction
paper cutouts in the kitchen. Shelley has finished some eyes]


RANDY
Sharon, have you seen Dad?

SHARON
He's not here, hun. He's having a meeting
with all the seniors in town at the
community center.

RANDY
Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors
in town are at a meeting, that means
that when the meeting gets out...


SHARON
Every senior in town will be driving
home...

RANDY
At the same time.  Oh My God!

[Downtown South Park. People are milling around. Randy runs into
the scene]

RANDY
Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting
getting out! Get off the streets!


SOMEONE
Oh my Goddd!

[Park County Community Center, day. The seniors exit the center
and head for their cars]

MARVIN
All right, great meeting everyone.
Let's do it again sometime.

ELDERLY WOMAN 1
So long, everybody.

ELDERLY MAN 5
Goodbye, Missy.

[Downtown South Park, at the farmer's market. Randy runs in]


RANDY
Get off the streets! Get off the streets!
Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where
are the boys?!

KYLE'S FATHER
We've gotta get out of here!

RANDY
The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!


KYLE'S FATHER
They, they're... they're playing street
hockey!

RANDY
Oh My God!!

[The neighborhood. Stan and the boys are playing street hockey.
Cartman is the goalie, a trashcan his goal]

CARTMAN
With just ten seconds to go, the offense
makes its move. Marsh heads for the
goal and paases the ball to the poor
kid. The poor kid hands it out to the
Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot
is blocked again , proving once and
for all that Jews cannot play hockey!


KYLE
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than
the goal.

CARTMAN
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey
body.

RANDY
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS!


KYLE
Dude, look!

RANDY
GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE
STREETS!

STAN
What is that?

KYLE
I don't know.

RANDY
GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!


KYLE
Dude, is that your dad?

STAN
I think so.

CARTMAN
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin'
the bottle again.

RANDY
-STREETS!! OFF-

STAN
What is he saying?

KYLE
I can't understand him.

RANDY
GAAAAAH!!

CARTMAN
Calm down! We cannot understand you!


KENNY
(Ohhhhh, look!)  (You guys!)

STAN
Oh Jesus!

CARTMAN
Old people!

RANDY
Come on!

CARTMAN
Oh God, they're coming!

[The Lodge. The group enters, Randy shuts and blocks the doors]


RANDY
Get over there! Stay low!

KYLE
Why are they all out driving at the
same time?

RANDY
Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone.
Let's just lay low for a minute until
we can find-  AWWWW!!

ELDERLY DRIVER
I don't remember there being a building
here.

RANDY
RUN!

ELDERLY PASSENGER
I told you to turn left, Larry.

RANDY
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come
on! Come on!!

KYLE
Aah! There's another one!

RANDY AND THE BOYS
AAAHH!!

ELDERLY DRIVER
Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue?


RANDY
In here!

CARTMAN
They're not gonna stop until we're all
dead!

RANDY
Quiet! Keep quiet!

STAN
Dad, I'm scared.

RANDY
Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay
the night in here. We'll stay the whole
winter if we have to.

STAN
I'm not staying the winter in this room!
We just need to tell old people they
can't drive anymore!

RANDY
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just
relax while I find the lights. Here
we go.

ELDERLY DRIVER
How the hell did we get up here?

RANDY AND THE BOYS
AAAAAAAHH!!

ELDERLY PASSENGER
I told you this was the wrong way!


[News 4. A splash screen shows various correspondents and anchors,
and a globe spins in front of the montage]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department
of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens
have until three p.m. to hand over their
driver's licenses. The new law was passed
just three days after the Night of Horror,
in which all seniors were out driving
at the same time, causing fourteen deaths
and three million dollars in damage.


[DMV, inside. A poster on the wall says "Drive 65 MPH. Stay alive."
Two men and a woman sit at a table taking the licenses seniors
standing in line give them.]

DMV OFFICIAL
Alrighty.  There we go. Next?

ELDERLY MAN 2
It ain't right what you're doin'! I
never had an accident in my life!


ELDERLY WOMAN 6
That's right. You shouldn't punish all
of us.

DMV OFFICIAL
We're sorry, but this is the only way
to be sure. Next please.  There we go.


ELDERLY MAN 6
But how am I supposed to get to the
grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy
medicine?

DMV OFFICIAL
Well, maybe you should be in a nursing
home. Hmmm?

ELDERLY MAN 7
Some of us would rather die!

DMV OFFICIAL
Well, we can certainly help you with
that, too.

ELDERLY WOMAN 7
We aren't second-class citizens!

ELDERLY MAN 8
That's right! You can take our licenses,
but you'll never take our pride!

AN ELDERLY MAN
Yeah...

[Stan's house, day. The boys leave the house]

CARTMAN
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being
able to walk the streets now that old
people are confined to their homes where
they belong?

MARVIN
Billy, get in the car! I need you boys
to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.


STAN
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should
be driving.

MARVIN
God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to
listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm
your dad's dad, and that means you get
in this car before I tan all your hides!


KYLE
Well, look at it this way: statistically
speaking, we're safer inside a car with
an old person driving than outside.


CARTMAN
My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full
of grace, the Lord is with thee, even
though I walk through the valley of
death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever
told you this, but, well, I love you
guys.  Except for you, Kyle.

MARVIN
Okay, all set?

KENNY
(Oooooo my God!)

STAN
Ah, I think there's a police car behind
you, Grandpa.

MARVIN
Eh?  Go around. Go around, you moron!


BARBRADY
Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!


CARTMAN
I believe that's us... thank God.


BARBRADY
Could I see your license, please?

MARVIN
I ain't got one! You peckers took it!


BARBRADY
Well then, I have to take you to jail.


MARVIN
You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head!
You just try!

[The police jail. Marvin sits behind bars with a cane.]

MARVIN
Stupid son of a- God damnit!

BARBRADY
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.


RANDY
Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look
at you now!

MARVIN
Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me
you son of a bitch!

RANDY
You just had to be so damn stubborn,
didn't you?!

MARVIN
Now my son is gonna talk to me like
I'm twelve.

RANDY
We're not treating you like children,
Dad. All right? Now I think you owe
Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs
to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?


MARVIN
Kiss my sagging ass!

RANDY
Well fine. I was gonna bail you out,
but maybe you can just sit here for
a bit and think about what you did!


MARVIN
Well I won't be sitting here long! I've
already called the AARP!

STAN
What's that?

MARVIN
The American Association of Retired
Persons! The largest political group
in the country! When seniors like me
are bein' descriminated against, the
AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're
gonna be sorry when they get here!


[Mr. Garrison's classroom, day. He's giving his class a history
lesson]

MR. GARRISON
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan
was a "Mongol," not to be confused with
a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicholas
Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what
...year ...the ...first ...film by
a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those
ROTC guys are way off course.

CARTMAN
More old people!

STAN
The American Association of Retired
Persons.

MR. GARRISON
Stay in your seats, children. I'll be
right back.

AARP LEADER
Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team
to Point Delta!

AARP MEMBER 1
Bravo Team is go.

AARP MEMBER 2
Move! Move! Move!

AARP MEMBER 3
Let's go! Let's go!

MR. GARRISON
Uh, can I help you folks find something?
Oowww!

CARTMAN
Old people gone mad!

[U.S. Geological Service. Randy sits at his desk making notes
when he hears the soft rustling of tarp on snow. He spins around
in his chair to see more AARP paratroopers. He rises in disbelief.
A gas canister flies through the window and unleashes its fumes.
Randy starts coughing. The door flies open and some AARP paratroopers
walk in wearing gas masks.]

AARP MEMBER
Contact.  Put your hands up, young
man!

[South Park Jail. Marvin is looking out his small cell window
when the AARP enters the jail and approach the cell]

AARP LEADER
Marvin Marsh?

MARVIN
Yes?

AARP LEADER
I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP.
Hu-we've come to help the seniors in
this town fight back.

MARVIN
Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill.

STEWART
Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We
just had to stop by Country Kitchen
Buffet first.

[Shady Acres, a Retirement Community. The AARP has arrived there]


AARP LEADER
It's the nursing home! Liberate our
comrades!

[Shady Acres, inside]

MALE NURSE
There now, Mr. Johnson.  We can go to
the cafeteroa amd get you some creamed
corn and toast.  Can I help you?

AARP LEADER
Help this!  The revolution is on, brother!
We're taking control of the town!


MR. JOHNSON
Well, alright, well it's about damn
time!  Hey everyone, we're taking the
town.

[The televison room. More seniors there are watching TV]

AARP MEMBER
Seniors, we're taking the town over.


AARP LEADER
The revolution is on!

ELDERLY WOMAN
The revolution?

ELDERLY MAN
Oh, I'd better get my other sweater.


[A convalescent room]

A NURSE
Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over
the town. Would you like a gun?

MRS. WYLAND
Oh, I suppose so.

[Downtown South Park, day. One of the members brings Randy forward]


RANDY
What the hell is going on?!

AARP MEMBER
Shut your piehole and get over there!


KYLE'S FATHER
Randy, what is this?

STEWART
Hey! You are now under the authority
of the AARP!

MARVIN
Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look
at you now!

RANDY
Dad, what are you doing??

MARVIN
The AARP is gonna help us take this
town until we get our licenses back!


ELDERLY WOMAN
Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more
money in Medi-Care, too!

AARP LEADER
That's right.

ELDERLY MAN
Yeah.

MAN IN VEST
Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're
not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked
out senior citizens.

STEWART
Heh??  We'll tell them if they don't
give us our demands, we'll start killin'
hostages!

MAN IN VEST
Huh, right. They're gonna really believe
that.

MARVIN
Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?


STEWART
Heh??  No, we gotta be tough! Just
like with those damned Japs!

RANDY
This is insane, Dad! You all need to
stop right now before morp people get
hurt>

MARVIN
The time when you can tell me what to
do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge
now!

[South Park, day. The town is now an encampment, protected by
barbed wire, sandbags, and metal shields. A woman with an IV
unit stands behind some sandbags]

MARVIN
All right, we've got control of the
Mayor's office and the fire station.


AARP MEMBER
Reinforcements have arrived from the
nursing home in Conifer.

STEWART
Good! Hell, us senior citizens could
take over the entire country!

AARP LOOKOUT
We've got company!

TANK DRIVER
Attention seniors: lay down your weapons
and turns yourselves over!

STEWART
Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.


MRS. APPLEGATE
All right.

TANK DRIVER
What do you want?

STEWART
Heh??

MARVIN
We want our licenses back!

OTHER SENIORS
Yeah!

ELDERLY WOMAN
That's right. And we want more money
in Medi-Care!

OTHER SENIORS
Yeah!

ELDERLY MAN
And we want those damned kids to stop
skateboardin' on the sidewalk!

OTHER SENIORS
Yeah!

[Nighttime, the drive-in. All adults who are not senior citizens
have been gathered into an enclosure around the massive screen.
Two seniors stand guard at the gates, other seniors keep the
adults in line. The adults are cold. Some cough, some try to
keep warm by burning tires inside empty gas drums. Randy is one
of those warming his hands over a fire. He moans. The boys arrive,
having not been arrested]

STAN
Hey Dad.

RANDY
Stan! Boys! You're safe!

STAN
Dad, why is everyone letting old people
do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?


RANDY
They've tried to stop them, son, but...
the seniors get up so early in the morning
they... get everything done before everyone
else is even awake!

KYLE
They're saying something about taking
over the entire country.

RANDY
Yes. And now seeing how early they
get up, I don't see how anyone can stop
them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get
up almost as early as they do! You can
fight them!

STAN
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do
it?

RANDY
No, son. We... like to sleep in.

AN ELDERLAY WOMAN
Two hostages come front and center!


RANDY
They're coming!! Get out of here before
they see you! Run to the hills and find
a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger
me! AVENGER ME!!

[The woods. The boys have set up a little camp there for the
night.]

STAN
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance
on the town. The old people have blockades
here  and here . The old ladies are
keeping watch in towers around the perimeter,
and the leaders along with my grandpa
are most likely in the Mayor's office.


CARTMAN
So our only solution is to cut off their
life force.

KYLE
We can't fight them, Cartman.

CARTMAN
No. But we can sneak into town and shut
down their food supply.  Here.

KYLE
Country Kitchen Buffet?

CARTMAN
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet,
and old people won't know what to do.


KYLE
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Is it? Two years ago they closed the
Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat
Springs. And all the old people died
of starvation in less than a week.


STAN
Yeah, I remember hearing about that.


KYLE
Ech, even if it could work, how would
we go about shutting it down?

CARTMAN
I think I have a plan, though we'll
have to do it tonight.  We'll start
by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised
as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and
Kyle split off and set a diversion on
the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan
and I sneak into the Mayor's office
and steal some of the explosives the
old people have stashed. Nine o'clock:
we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen
Buffet, where we strap the explosives
and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say
our triple goodbye to Kyle, and them
we send him inside.

CARTMAN
Yeah!

STAN
All right!

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

CARTMAN
Aw yeah!

STAN
We did it!

STAN
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen
Buffet and lock it from the inside so
the seniors can't get in.

CARTMAN
Well, right, or we could always do that.


[South Park, day. The old people have the run of the town, and
they're bringing in heavier artillery]

STEWART
All right everyone, round up your ammunition
and get ready to move! We're takin'
this war further out!

AARP MEMBERS
All right!

MARVIN
Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin'
to do for us, but uh, all we want is
our licenses back.

STEWART
Huh??  Heck no! This is goin' too well.We're
gonna take the whole country back. Wipe
out everyone below the age of sixty
five!

MARVIN
Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?


STEWART
Come on, everyone! It's time to plan
for Phase 2!  What the heck?  Huh? What
is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen
should be open!

ELDERLY MAN 9
It's not open? It has to be!

ELDERLY MAN 10
Try a window.

ELDERLY MAN 11
They're blocked from the inside.

STEWART
No...  Let us in! Let us in!

ELDERLY MAN 9
Open the door! It's six a.m.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for
us!

ELDERLY MAN
You have to let us in!

ARMY OFFICIAL
All right everyone, area secure. Collect
their weapons and free the hostages.
That was a great strategy, boys. You
may very well have saved this entire
country.

RANDY
Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it
over?

ARMY OFFICIAL
Everything is fine. Control of the town
is back to you folks.

STEWART
Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?


SOLDIER
Sir, what should we do with this one?


ARMY OFFICIAL
It's up to the townspeople.

RANDY
Well, I think he learned his lesson.
Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad?
I think somebody owes us all an apology.
Yes he does.

STAN
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your
fault!

RANDY
Huh?

STAN
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be
talked to like a child. I think half
of what he was angry about wasn't what
you were doing, but how you were doing
it.

MARVIN
That's right.

STAN
And Grandpa, you should be proud that
you made it through life to be a senior,
but you should also realize that, when
you're behind the wheel, you're a killing
machine.

MARVIN
I know. I guess sometimes us seniors
need to know when to stop driving so
we don't put the responsibility on our
families.

RANDY
Well, I think this has been a real learning
experience for the Marsh family. People
died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just
go home.

MARVIN
Sure. I'll drive.

RANDY
That's our Grandpa.

STAN
Dude, I hate my family.

[Russell Crowe Show]

RUSSELL CROWE
Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy!


SHELLEY
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't
even like that show!

STAN
It's not the show we care about. During
one of the commercial breaks of tonight's
episode, they're gonna show the exclusive
never-before-seen trailer to the new
Terrance & Phillip movie!

KYLE
It's the biggest night of the year.


SHELLEY
That's stupid! See you turdy critters
some other time!

STAN
But all the other kids are gonna watch
it and talk about it at school tomorrow.


SHELLEY
No, turds!

CARTMAN
Shelley, did I ever tell you how hot
I think you are?

SHELLEY
Shut up, fat turd!!

We're not watching this!

RUSSELL CROWE
Come on!

MAN
Look, I apologize

STAN
But Shelley, it's the Russell Crowe
Show! You always said there's nothing
you love more than Russell Crowe.


SHELLEY
There is one thing I love more than
Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you
unhappy. So, Buffy it is!

STAN
Shelley, please, let us watch. We'll
do anything. Anythng!

SHELLEY
All right. I just started my period,
and I need tampons. If one of you turds
will go buy them at the store for me,
you can watch your stupid turd show
with your stupid turd movie commercial
in it!

STAN
O-K, deal.

SHELLEY
And they'd better be here when I come
back downstairs, turds!

RUSSELL CROWE
Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't
it, kids? But if looks like if we're
gonna get in more fights, we're gonna
have to go look for 'em.

KYLE
Dude, why'd you make that deal? If
we're out buying tampons, we'll miss
the trailer anyway/

BUTTERS
Ehyeah!

STAN
Well, only one of us has to go to the
store. The others can watch.

KYLE
You'd miss the new trailer?

STAN
Dude, I'm not going.

CARTMAN
Alright, we'll have to play for it.
How about... if your name is Butters,
you have to go. Okay, so what's your
name?

STAN
Stan.

CARTMAN
Stan, okay. What's your name?

KYLE
Kyle.

CARTMAN
Kyle. What's your name?

BUTTERS
Butters. Aw, I lose, huh?

CARTMAN
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry,
tough break.

KYLE
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably
mke it back in time before the first
commercial break.

BUTTERS
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the
wind.

RUSSELL CROWE
Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't
it, kids?

KYLE
Dude, thank God for stupid people


CARTMAN
Amen.

RUSSELL CROWE
...we're gonna have to go look for 'em.
Where should we go fight people next,
Tugger?

TUGGER
TOOOOOOT

RUSSELL CROWE
Great idea!  Tugger thinks we should
go to the faaar away of China.  China
is one of the oldest civilizations on
earth. And from what I understand, they
LOVE a good fight! So let's go!

TUGGER
TOOOT TOOOT

MAN WITH MOUSTACHE
Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!

RUSSELL CROWE
Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my
Gmah, bah bah byah byah!  Why don't
you mind your own business, you scrotum?!


Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.

STAN
Dude, why is this guy always beating
everybody up?

RUSSELL CROWE
What a glorious day to spend away fight-in'
round the world.

CARTMAN
What's wrong with the colors on your
TV, Stan? They're all saturated.


STAN
They look fine to me.

KYLE
Just don't mess with it, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose.


KYLE
Just just leave it alone.

CARTMAN
Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip
trailer with messed-up colors? I don't.
How's that?

STAN
That's worse!

CARTMAN
Okay, how about ... that?

STAN
Dude!

KYLE
God-damnit Cartman! You broke it!

CARTMAN
It was just... I just... Butters, you
asshole!

STAN
Dude, the commercials could start any
time!

CARTMAN
I don't think we're watchin' them on
this TV.

KYLE
God-damnit! Come on, we can go watch
it at my house!

STAN
Get all the stuff!

BUTTERS
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I

STAN
We're going to Kyle's house to watch!

the way, with Kyle and Butters following]

BUTTERS
Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez

STAN
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!


CARTMAN
Wait! Wait you guys! You guys! You

[Kyle's house, moments later. Ike is watching TV]

A VOICE
...but the Palestinian government uh

STAN
Huff, huff

BUTTERS
Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

RUSSELL CROWE
And so here we are in history-rich Choina.

CARTMAN
Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.

IKE
Dadadadat!

KYLE
No Ike! They're playing the trailer
to the new Terrance & Phillip movie
during the show, and we have to watch
it!

RUSSELL CROWE
This is Tianinman Square. Lots of good
foitin' has gone on here throughout
the years, including a fan-tastic massacre
that took place back in '93.  These
chinamen can grow to over five feet
tall, and in a fight, are known to kick
with their legs. Let's see if we can
get in for a closer look.  Oi!  I've
gotten close enough now that they're
startin' to get real froigh'ened. You
can see the fine hairs on the back of
their necks standin' on end.  Gotcha
mate!  Ay, you wanna fight, huh?!  Think
you could take me, you little buggers?!


CARTMAN
God, when is this gonna get to the comeercial?


KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the
TV.

KYLE
They're goin' to show the new Terrance
& Phillip trailer

KYLE'S FATHER
You know your brother watches the MacNeil/Lehrer
Report every night at ten!

IKE
Etetheh bunlapala un good night.

KYLE
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen
footage.

KYLE'S FATHER
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is
Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer


KYLE
God-damnit. Come on, guys. We gotta
go to Butters' house.

STAN
Aww!

CARTMAN
Argh!

BUTTERS
Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my
house.

CARTMAN
We can't go to my house either. It's
being fumigated.

STAN
AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma
TV with surround-sound. Let's go to
his house! Come on!

LEHRER
-takin' place there... all these years
are sure to continue until the governments
of these regions can actually come about
soe recon-

IKE
Look at Barney fly.

[The neighborhood. The boys run towards Chef's house. Stan, Kyle,
and Butters run past, huffing and puffing]

CARTMAN
Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!

[Chef's house, moments later. The boys are at his front door,
and Stan knocks]

KYLE
God-damnit! If we miss the commercials,
I'll never forgive my brother!

CHEF
Oh. Hello there, children.

THE BOYS
Hey Chef.

CHEF
Uh, how's it goin'?

[Chef's living room. The boys are seated on the sofa, with Stan
trying to get the remote control working]

CHEF
Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh?
Pretty cool, ain't it?

STAN
Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?


CHEF
Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features
than the space shuttle.  I can't figure
it out at all.

RUSSELL CROWE
-bloomin' Taj Mahal.

CARTMAN
There, you got it, you got it!

RUSSELL CROWE
Freakin' Indian  doesn't even put up
a  fight!

STAN
We made it!

CARTMAN
Oh, thank God.

CHEF
Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't
be this show about a man who beats people
up because he's insecure.

CARTMAN
We don't give two craps about Russell
Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer
about the new Terrance & Phillip movie,
that'ssupposed to play during the commercials.


RUSSELL CROWE
Alright everyone, we're gonna take
our first commercial break. But be sure
not to go anywhere, because there's
lot's more people to beat up.

STAN
Here they come!

KYLE
Heuh, the commercials!

ANNOUNCER
Now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin'
Around The World!

THE BOYS
Awww!

BUTTERS
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't
show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.


STAN
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play
it during the first commercial break.


KYLE
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around
and watch more of this retarded show.


RUSSELL CROWE
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in'
round the world.  Oi! Now Tugger's brought
me to one of the greatest places for
foightin' in North America.  Brooklyn,
New York. Lots of minorities here, and
they don't take kindly to whitey.  Let's
get a closer look. Come on, Tugger!
Looks like we got some black people,
and some Puerto Ricans.  Notice the
colorful rags on their heads, meaning
they could be part of a gang, and therefor,
real used to fightin'.

BLACK PLAYER
Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't
that that Gladiator guy?

PUERTO RICAN PLAYER
Where?

BLACK PLAYER
Behind that plant, next to that tugboat?


PUERTO RICAN PLAYER
Oh yeah, I thnk it is.

RUSSELL CROWE
Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy!
Oh my God, I've never seen an actor
before!  Why don't you choke on some
pig vomit, you stupid sops!

CHEF
Why can't this guy control his temper?


RUSSELL CROWE
Well?? You all just gonna stand there
or are you gonna fight?  Croikey, you've
done it now!

CARTMAN
Thsi TV is great, Chef.

CHEF
Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool
feature, too. Check this out. You can
watch three channels all at once. I
think if you hit this button here-
No, no wait. You hit this button here
No, that's not it. Let's see.  Menu
Function

STAN
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials
might come on soon.

CHEF
Let's see.  Aw, damnit!

KYLE
Get it back to normal, Chef!

CHEF
I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function-
Enter? No, no. Back. H.E.M.

THE TV
Human eradication mode, active.

STAN
Oh God-damnit!

KYLE
The TV left.

BUTTERS
Uh but the next commercials will be
on soon.

STAN
Come on, we gotta go somewhere else!


[The neighborhood. The boys run towards the bar. Stan, Kyle,
and Butters run past, huffing and puffing]

BUTTERS
Whre do we go? Where do we go?

STAN
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!


CARTMAN
You guys! Aagh! God-damnit!

[The bar. The boys burst through the door and head for the counter.
The TV turns on to the Russell Crowe show]

RUSSELL CROWE
You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies!


THE BOYS
Phew!

STAN
We made it.

CARTMAN
This is killing me. The human body
was not meant to move quickly like that.


[The Russell Crowe show]

RUSSELL CROWE
These are the Florida Keys, a remote
island chain just a few miles from...
Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in
Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened
wit that?

TUGGER
Mooooot.

RUSSELL CROWE
It's that God-damned editor! He cut
the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm
gonna get him!

[The editing room, moments later]

EDITOR
Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably
done around seven.

RUSSELL CROWE
Who the hell do you think you are?!


EDITOR
I'm the editor.

RUSSELL CROWE
I know you're the bloomin' editor! I
mean, who the hell do you think you
are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes
short?!

EDITOR
Dude, the director said to cut it.


RUSSELL CROWE
Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit
Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle!


JIMBO
Well that guy's just plain nuts.

BARKEEP
Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be
in here.

KYLE
We're not kids. We're full-grown men
with dwarfism! How dare you assume that
all midgets are children! We demand
an apology!

BARKEEP
You ain't midgets, your lips are too
full.  Now GET OUT!!

STAN
But we have to watch the commercials
in this show.

BARKEEP
Look, this is a bar! We can't have children
in here. People come here for debauchery
and sin!

CARTMAN
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner
for a dollar.

BUTTERS
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!


BARKEEP
GET OUT!

THE BOYS
Aaah!

STAN
Come on, we gotta get to a TV!

CARTMAN
Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!

[Downtown South Park. The TV, now a robot, marches through town
blasting holes into buildings. Chef follows behnd on a cell phone]


CHEF
Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin'
problems with my new television. It
sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin'
around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay.
Oh, so I press "menu," then "function."


TOWNSMAN
Jesus!  Waaaah!

CHEF
No, that didn't work. Did I set it at
ten o'clock? Uh, no.  Oh, really? Well,
how do I do that?

[Shady Acres, A Retirement Community. The boys rush in and head
for the empty seats in the TV room]

CARTMAN
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold
it!

KYLE
We're not too late!

RUSSELL CROWE
Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you
lookin' so down?

TUGGER
Mooot Mooot.

RUSSELL CROWE
Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems
his girlfriend and him had a bit of
a row last night.

TUGGER
Mooooot.

OLD MAN
...What is this?

[The Russell Crow show.]

RUSSELL CROWE
Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I
make you feel better? I know!  How would
you like me to sing one of the songs
off me new album?

TUGGER
Nooo! Nooooo!

RUSSELL CROWE
What's that, Tugger? You say you really
love the songs on my album?

TUGGER
Noooooooooo!

RUSSELL CROWE
Alright then, Tugger.

TUGGER
Noo no. Noooooo!

RUSSELL CROWE
You know that you're my babih. You know

RUSSELL CROWE
We'll weather it somehow.

TUGGER

[Shady Acres TV room.]

CARTMAN

STAN

ANNOUNCER
And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin'
Around The World!

CARTMAN
That's it? That's all the commercials?


KYLE
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip
trailer again!

STAN
I knew it. They're waiting until the
very last commercial break.

KYLE
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this
whole retared Russell Crowe show!


[The Russell Crow show. Russell Crowe is sobbing on a sofa in
a hospital hallway]

RUSSELL CROWE
Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?!  Doctor!
Tell me how he is, doctor!

DOCTOR
Well, he's a very sick little tugboat.


[Shady Acres TV room.]

OLD MAN
What is this? We wanna watch "Puppies
From Around The World."

OLD WOMAN
Yeah. We don't like this show.

CARTMAN
Sh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet
right now!

[The Russell Crow show.]

RUSSELL CROWE
You've gotta save him, Doc! Tugger!
'E's my best friend! The only friend
in the world who would-

DOCTOR
He's going to live, but-

RUSSELL CROWE
Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vagina!
I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy
about me feelin's for Tugger!

DOCTOR
Sorry.

RUSSELL CROWE
Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't

live?! Tell me the truth!

DOCTOR
...Now?

RUSSELL CROWE
Yes, now's fine.

DOCTOR
Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay.
He just needs an oil change and a new
steamstack.

RUSSELL CROWE
Ooo, delolly! D'you hear that, everybody?!
Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what
that makes me feel like doin'? Fightin'!


[Shady Acres TV room.]

OLD MAN
This show is too violent! Put the puppies

OLD FOLKS
Yeah!

OLD WOMAN 2
Please

CARTMAN
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching
this until the next commercial and that's
final, old people!

OLD MAN 2
All right, that does it! We know how
to get our way! Everyone, on the count
of three, release your bowels! One!
Two!

THE BOYS
Awww!

CARTMAN
Eewww!

STAN
Oh, God, it's horrible!

[Shady Acres entrance.]

KYLE
That'd disgusting, dude!

CARTMAN
God, I hate old people!

STAN
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's
house! We have nowhere else to go!


BUTTERS
I told you, we can't go to my house!


CARTMAN
And my house is being fumigated!

STAN
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your
house even if it is being fumigated!


[The neighborhood. The boys rush to Cartman's house.]

THE BOYS
...come on!

[Cartman's house and garage, under purple and orange tarps. The
boys enter a living room filled with fumigation gas, which makes
the room look foggy.]

[The Russell Crow show.]

RUSSELL CROWE
Crikey! Our Tugger looks healthy, happy,
and  fit as a whistle!

[Cartman's living room]

KYLE
It's okay, it's still the show.

[The Russell Crow show.]

RUSSELL CROWE
But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide
made me realize that I should take up
a cause. Most great actors take up causes,
and I'm the greatest of them all! So,
from now on i'm goona spend all my spare
time ...fighting cancer.  Right! Where
is that pussy cnacer anyway?!

[Cartman's living room. the gas is overwhelming them, and they
look ready to pass out]

KYLE
Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take
it.

STAN
Me neither. I'll be dead before the
commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot
there's a black and white television
back at my house!

KYLE
Will your sister let us watch it?

STAN
She has to!

[The neighborhood. The boys rush back to Stan's house.]

STAN
Hurry! The commercials will be on any
minute!

BUTTERS
Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...

CARTMAN
Hey you guys! Eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus
help me!  Oh! I forgot the doughnuts!
Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave those
doughnuts at home!

[Stan's house. The boys reach the front door.]

BUTTERS
Oh Jesus! Wait.

STAN
What?

BUTTERS
I never gave Shelley her tampons. She's

AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh.

SHELLEY

KYLE

[The Russell Crowe show. Russell is in a hospital room with Tugger]


RUSSELL CROWE
Well, we couldn't fight cancer, but

TUGGER

CHEF
...Yes, I pressed "menu" three thimes!
No! It's givin' me the same error message!
Yes I read the instruction maual!


[Luau's Toys, moments later. The boys run by]

THE BOYS
Where do we go?!

KYLE
Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??

STAN
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are
you absolutely sure we can't go to your
house??

BUTTERS
I'm sure! there's no way!

KYLE
Uh why not?!

BUTTERS
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of
town, and I don't have a babysitter.


CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit you better be kidding!


BUTTERS
No! I really dont have a babysitter.
That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.


KYLE
This whole time your TV is in a house
with nobody in it?!

STAN
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters
later!

[Butters' house, minutes later. The boys burst through the front
door]

THE BOYS
AAAAA!!

CARTMAN
The time has come! Turn it on, turn
it on!

[The Russell Crow show.]

RUSSELL CROWE
And so we'll be right back after these
commercials.

STAN
We've made it!

KYLE
The last commercial break is starting!


ANNOUNCER
Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will
be right back after a few more commercials.


CARTMAN
These commercials are all so God-damned
stupid!

STAN
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial
break gonna be??

KYLE
What if they don't show the Terrance
& Phillip trailer at all? What if we
went through all of this for nothing?


BUTTERS
They have to show it! They promised
they would!

CARTMAN
You guys, calm down. This is what TV
shows always do. They make the last
commercial break the longest.

KYLE
That's bullcrap! TV shows are gay!


STAN
Wait a minute! Look!  "The following
preview has..." This is it! This is
it!

[The Terrance & Phillip trailer]

ANNOUNCER
Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian

CARTMAN

BUTTERS
Hey, I'm so glad we didn't miss it!


CARTMAN
You guys, Clyde said he taped it and
kids can come over to have a see.


STAN
Oh, dude, let's go!

BUTTERS
Yeah.

KYLE
Hey, that's even better than their first
movie, huh?

CARTMAN
Yeah, it sure does!

STAN
I wonder if it all a western?

BUTTERS
How far away is June?

[The Russell Crow show, sunset. The sun is about to drop over
the horizon behind Russell and Tugger.]

RUSSELL CROWE
Well, we sure had a good time today,
didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen,
a few packers, and a lot of Colombians,
to name just a few. But I sure am glad
we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you??


WALLY B.
I'm glad to be back, Rusell!

A GIRL

[does some boxing moves and then hops into the boat]

But now don't you start to whine

I'll see ya again next time.

'Cause there's plenty a-more a-foightin' left to do.

[Wally B. hops closer, and finally into Russell's arms. Next
shot, a departing Tugger, headed for the sunset. Russell appears
and sings the signature line, slowing with every word]

Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' foightin' round the world.


See you next time, everybody! [waves to the camera]

[South Park, night. Chef's TV is still walking around, but this
time away from town. It's showing the Russell Crowe show. Chef
is still trying to shut it down.]

CHEF
So I'm supposed to press "menu," then
"function," then "enter."

"QUINTUPLETS 2000"


Written by


Trey Parker





RANDY
Okay, is everyone ready to go?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted
to see Cirque du Cheville.

SHARON
Me too. We were lucky to get tickets.
Come on, boys! We're gonna be late.


LIANE
Oh, don't they look precious?

STAN
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this
just a circus, with elephants and lions
and stupid clowns

SHARON
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian.
They get acrobats and singers from all
over the world and then do very artistic
things..

KYLE
Awwww!

GRANDPA
Why the hell do you wanna take these
boys to see that fufu French theater
crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!


SHARON
Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!


GRANDPA
Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch
of frogs prance around in tights and
make-op wrappin' their peckers around
each other's faces!

SHARON
Come on, everybody, let's go.

GRANDPA
Close your eyes and cover your ears,
Billy! Remember, you're a man.

[Cirque du Cheville, night. Folks are streaming in to get seats.
Next, under the Big Top]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, this is so exciting

SHARON
Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.


STAN
Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny,
thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.
Go away, please.

CARTMAN
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella,
clown! Beat it!  Ow.

RANDY
You didn't know that was gonna happen,
did you, Stanley?

CARTMAN
Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man,
somebody stop my guts frm bursting out
of my sides!

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking
and no flash-photography during Sarque
du Son Bleu

CARTMAN
Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached
warp factor 5, captain.

LIANE
Eric, sshhhh.

KYLE
How long does this thing last?

STAN
Two hours.

CARTMAN, KYLE, KENNY
Awwwgh.

[Cirque du Cheville, later. A troupe of twelve dancers leap high
and drop down again. The parents are still in thrall, and their
eyes follow the dancers' leaps. Cartman is now asleep. Some time
elapses, and a singer sings her song. The other three boys are
getting sleepy. The smiles are gone from the parents' faces.
The singer is shown with a two-person high-wire act overhead.
Little "birds" pop out from her dress and dance around. A new
act appears, and Stan is falling asleep on his left hand. Kyle
and Kenny seem more awake. An invisible man in a visible suit
walks on, and a clown jumps out of the floor in front of him.
The clown and the man shake hands, and the clown rips the man's
right arm off. A new act comes on, and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny
are really drowsy. The curtains open to reveal five girls, and
they come forward to dance]

SHARON
Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets
from Romania.

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

CARTMAN
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers?


KYLE
Whoa.

STAN
Damn, dude.

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Yayy!

KENNY
(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)

[Cirque du Cheville, dismissal. The crowd exits the tent]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, that was wonderful!

SHARON
Yes. Too bad it was their last show,
or I'd go see it again.

KYLE
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.


CARTMAN
Yeah, especially that second one from
the left. She was fine!

KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you talking
about?! They're identical!

CARTMAN
Not that second one from the left; she
had it goin' on!

CLOWN
Don't forget to buy your souvenirs,
folks.

STAN
Damn, dude, do you see how much money
this place is raking in?

CARTMAN
Yeah. I could prance around in tights
and sing opera too, for that kind of
cash.

KYLE
Hey, we should start our own Cirque
du Cheville.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

STAN
Yeah. This one's moving out of town,
so we could take over.

KYLE
Let's go practice.

[Dressing Room #1. "Vladchick Contorting Quintuplets" is written
over a star.]

GRANDMAMA
Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against
the cold.

A QUINT
Did we do good final show, Grandmama?


GRANDMAMA
Very good, my girls. I only wish it
weren't your last show. I love this
country so very much.

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time
to return to Romania.

GRANDMAMA
Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone
second to finish getting them ready.
This way, girls. Quickly.

QUINT #2
Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?


GRANDMAMA
Your mother did not want you to grow
up in Romania. This is our only chance.


ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Nid kelmin da bushka.

ATTENDANT
Nid kelmin da lushka velt

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt!

ATTENDANT
M-Mrs. Vladchick?

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Dash fam da bushka!

[Cirque du Cheville, outside the main tent. The two Romanian
men rush out]

ATTENDANT
They're trying to defect!

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Cauch! We need a boat.

OARSMAN IN VEST
Where to, Mack?

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Follow that boat.

[The Marsh house, living room. The boys have bought a CD of the
show, and Kenny sings to the instrumental of one of the songs.
Kenny is wearing the costume the first singer wore. The other
three are practicing... um... Stan tries to leap into Kyle's arms,
but they end up tumbling on the floor. Cartman runs forth and
does some cartwheels, but lands on a coffee table, breaking it
to pieces.]

STAN
Dude, this isn't working.

KYLE
It's Kenny's singing!

KENNY
(Hunh?)

CARTMAN
Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!


KENNY
(I'm singing as good as I can!)

STAN
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You
have to get better! Try it again!


GRANDPA
Aha, I knew it. They turned you into
poofders.

[Stark's Pond. Grandmama and the girls zoom away.]

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
There's nowhere to go, Mrs. Vladchick.
Pull over!

GRANDMAMA
Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta.

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Be careful, Gabul! Be careful, Gabul!
Yaaah!

TOP GIRL
Did we do good, Grandmama?

GRANDMAMA
Very good, Glacas.

[The Marsh house. Snow falls outside. The other boys have gone
home]

STAN
I'm tired, Grandpa.

GRANDPA
No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and
watch more McGyver. We've gotta get
all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out
of ya.  Who the hell would be ringin'
the doorbell at this time of night?


STAN
I don't know.  Whoa.

GRANDMAMA
We are very sorry to disturb you. My
granddaughters are cold and tired. Is
there any possibility we could pay you
for a place to sleep?

RANDY
You're from Cirque du Cheville.

GRANDMAMA
Yes. We- missed our train. If we could
shelter here; it would only be for one
night.

RANDY
Well...

SHARON
Well, of course you can. Come in out
of the snow.

GRANDMAMA
Oh, thank you so much.

SHARON
There's some spare bedrooms upstairs,
Mrs....?

GRANDMAMA
Vladchick.

GRANDPA
That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.


RANDY
Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!

GRANDPA
Well, it's good for 'im.

[The McCormick house. Kenny is in his room with three books on
his bed.]

KENNY
(Let's see... No, not there)  (Let's
see. Nothing there)  (Let's see... here!)


NARRATOR
Hello, and welcome to: "Singing like
Bocelli for Dummies." Lesson 1: Yaaayayeha!


KENNY
(Yaaayaya.)

NARRATOR
Lesson 2: Hehyayaya hehyayaya!

KENNY
(Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)

NARRATOR
Good: And now we'll do the entire piece,
"Con Te Partirò"

KENNY
(Con Te Partirò?)

(...Su navi per mari

che, io lo so,

no, no, non esistono più.

con te io li rivivrò.


Con te...)

[...and it becomes background music as the camera pans over to...]


[The Marsh house. Grandmama Vladchick is in her nightgown combing
her hair. Grandpa Marsh rolls by]

KENNY
(...partirò.)

GRANDPA
Got everything you need there, do ya?


KENNY
(Su navi per mari)

GRANDMAMA
Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my
little granddaughters.

KENNY
(che, io lo so,)

GRANDPA
They're quite agile little things, aren't
they?

KENNY
(no, no, non esistono più.)

GRANDMAMA
Yes, as I was back in my day. I was
a contortionist, too.

KENNY
(con te io li rivivrò.)

GRANDPA
Y'don't say.

GRANDMAMA
Yes.

GRANDPA
You...

KENNY
(Con te...)

GRANDPA
...remember any of that stuff, do ya?


KENNY
(...partirò.

Su navi per mari

che, io lo so,

no, no, non esistono più.)


[as Kenny sings, Grandpa returns to Mrs. Vladchick's room naked...
and without the wheelchair. She lifts up her left leg over her
head, then lets it go. Kenny's getting into the song. The tape
speeds up a bit...]


(Io con te...!)

GRANDPA
Ah.  Oh.  Ah!  Oh.  Oh-oooh-oooh!

[The McCormick house, Kenny's room. The music stops with a thump
and Kenny collapses on his bed exhausted]

NARRATOR
And now lesson 4: the complete works
of Mozart. Let's begin.

KENNY
(Damn!)

[The Marsh house, morning. Randy and Sharon are in the kitchen
enjoying some coffee]

SHARON
What should we do, Randy? I like these
Romanians fine, but I hope that old
woman isn't planning on staying here
much longer.

RANDY
Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still
sleeping.

SHARON
Poor dear must be tired.

GRANDPA
You're damn right she's tired.

RANDY
Huh?

GRANDPA
Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a
little trouble walkin' today is all.
.

[The Marsh house, outside. Stan leads the other three boys in
the side gate and to the backyard]

STAN
Hurry up, you guys!

CARTMAN
What's going on?

STAN
Dude, you're not gonna believe this.


KYLE
What?!

QUINT 1
Hello.

QUINT 2
Hello.

QUINT 3
Hi.

QUINT 4
Hello.

CARTMAN
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!


STAN
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.


KYLE
What's a "quin-tuplet"?

QUINT 2
Ve are twins, except there are five
of us instead of two.

KYLE
But there's only four of you.

QUINT 2
No no, Natalia is just playing mirror,
but it's with Nadia.

NADIA
Hello.

KYLE
So if you're identical, does that mean
you all think alike?

ALL FIVE QUINTS
No, don't be ridiculous.

STAN
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?


A QUINT
You have your own?

STAN
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better
at singing first.

KENNY
(Hey!)

CARTMAN
But as soon as he starts singing better,
we're all gonna make bank!

QUINT 1
Okay.

QUINT 3
Sounds good.

QUINT 2
Count me in.

QUINT 5
Okay.

QUINT 4
...Oh, and me.

THE BOYS
All right!

[The Marsh house, kitchen]

RANDY
Alright, we've gotta figure out what
to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello?
Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanina Woman?  Ma'am?


GRANDPA
Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha
ha.

RANDY
No, Dad.

GRANDPA
A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr
hr hr.

RANDY
No, Dad, she's dead!

GRANDPA
What?!  Oh, dear Jesus!

RANDY
It looks like she had a heart attack.


GRANDPA
No wonder she didn't say good-night.


RANDY
...Ew!

[The Marsh house, the backyard]

STAN
Okay, hold it, hold it.

THE BOYS
Ow!

SHARON
I don't know how to tell. You tell them.


RANDY
Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.


QUINT 5
What?

RANDY
Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step
forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls.


SHARON
Randy!

QUINT 2
Grandmama is dead?

QUINT 1
What are we going to do now?

CARTMAN
You guys, come here.  This is totally
awesome.

STAN
What?!

KYLE
How can you say that?

CARTMAN
Because now we can convince them to
stay here, and now our circus will kick
ass!

KYLE
Oh, yeah!

STAN
Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with
us? Please? Can they?

RANDY
Well, Stan, it's not really our-

STAN
They have nowhere else to go.  Please?


SHARON
Well, for the time being I, I mean,
of course they can stay.

STAN, KYLE
Hooray!

CARTMAN
Hooray!

[The Marsh house, the backyard, some days later. Neighborhood
men and women walk up to a fenced-in area of the yard in which
the quints play with varous toys and balls]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing at the home in South
Park where five precious little girls
have been rescued from Romania. Their
mother passes away some months ago,
and then their grandmother died trying
to bring them here. But all is well
now, and people are coming from all
over the country to view the little
tykes.  If you'd like to come down and
visit the quintuplets, admission is
only $5, and for a few dollars more
, you can feed them fishsticks.

A QUINT
Mmm.

REPORTER
Tom, it looks like these cute little
girls have made it out of that armpit
of a country they call Romania.

[Romania, day. Government officials watch the report in a run-down
office]

REPORTER
Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets
no longer have to live in Romania, the
asshole of the world.  Back to you,
Tom.

PRESIDENT
This is not good. It makes our country
look poor and stupid.

ROMANINA OFFICIAL
This could kill our tourism.

PRESIDENT
You know what to do.

[South Park School of Music]

INSTRUCTOR
Alright, Kenny, let's start with some
warm-up exercises.

KENNY
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

MRS.MCCORMICK
Well, what do you think? Can you help
him become a better singer?

INSTRUCTOR
Well, he's got potential. Depends on
how good he wants to be.

KENNY
(Well, let's do it then!)

INSTRUCTOR
Well, if you wanna be a real singer,
you need to go to a conservatory in
Europe. There's no other alternative.


KENNY
(Europe?)

MRS.MCCORMICK
We can't afford that.

INSTRUCTOR
Well, then, I'm afraid your son will
always be a hack.

KENNY
(Awww.)

MRS.MCCORMICK
Well, Kenny, if it means that much to
you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and...
you can sing on the way to make money.


KENNY
(Yeah.)

[The Marsh house, breaking news music is heard. Sharon rushes
into the kitchen]

SHARON
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look
at this.

RANDY
What?

ANCHOR TOM
...until the U.S. government receives
this video, which was sent from Romania
just hours ago.

MAN
Hello. This is Romanian father. I am
desperate to have my girls returned
to me in Romania.

RANDY
Uh-oh.

STAN
That's your dad?

QUINT 2
Maybe.

QUINT 1
But we haven't seen papa for more than
five years.

MAN
How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.


VOICE
Nadia!

MAN
Nadia, my sweet Barshta

VOICE
Baltania!

MAN
Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching
for their return. I, I know the American
government will do what's right.


KYLE
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back
to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque
dei Ceville going.

STAN
Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send tham
back, are you??

SHARON
Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we?


RANDY
I don't know.

KYLE
You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania,
do you? It sucks there.

CARTMAN
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In
Romania they just oppress you and try
to bring you down.

SHARON
We'll have to call the police and see
what they want us to do.

CARTMAN
Damn, we might be screwed.

STAN
No! We've just gotta convince these
chicks that America kicks the ass out
of every other country. Come on!


[South Park Train Station. Kenny and his mom await the train.
Kenny launches into "La Donna E Mobile." Mrs. McCormick holds
a "Trying To Get To Europe" sign. The other boys take the quints
to South Park Funland]

CARTMAN
You see, in America we have... log rides!
Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing
contests!

22nd Annual Sheep Shearing Contest

[A man sheas a sheep with a shearer as the eight kids and four
adults watch]

A FAN
Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah.

CARTMAN
And shoppong malls! Hooray!

Welcome

To Europe!

Coziest Little

Place On Earth!

Elevation 4200 ft.

KENNY
(Woo hoo!)

[the U.S. Capitol. The Romanian father and two Romanian officials
sit in Janet Reno's office]

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand,
the father has right to his children.


JANET RENO
Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay
here. Why don't you all stay here in
America, and this whole thing can go
away.

MR. VLADCHICK
Okay.  Heh!

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Our home is Romania. We love it there.


MR. VLADCHICK
Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
If daughters will not return on their
own, you must force them to return


JANET RENO
Gentlemen, this has to be handled very
delicately. You don't understand Americans'
power to protest.

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Protest?

JANET RENO
Look, people have it so good in America
that they get bored very easily. And
when people get bored they start protesting
things.

ALL THREE MEN
Oh

JANET RENO
But I want to assure you, and the Romanian
people, that we are going to do everything
in our power to make this as confusing
as possible.

[South Park, the Marsh house, day. A crowd of protesters lobby
in front of the house]

PROTESTERS
Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!


LONE PROTESTER
Fur is murder! Fur is murder!  Oh, what
are we protesting here?

A PROTESTER
Romania sucks!

LONE PROTESTER
Oh, let's see  Here we go. Romania sucks!


PROTESTERS
Romania sucks! Romania sucks!

SHARON
Oh my God! I didn't know this was going
to become such a big deal.

RANDY
That'll teach us for taking an old
lady and her granddaughters out of the
cold.

LEAD AGENT COLLINS
Attention, people inside the house!
You must return the quintuplets to
their father! You have until...  Oh yeah,
that's good.  You have until Easter
Sunday to comply.

PROTESTER
Nooo!

PROTESTERS
Boooo!

COLLINS
What?!

[The Marsh house, Stan's room. Stan and friends are oblivious
to the action outside]

STAN
Okay, let's try it again. Hup!

A QUINT
Hup!

KYLE
Alright!

RANDY
Stan, we-

SHARON
Stanley, we have some bad news. The
courts have decided the girls must go
back to Romania.

STAN
No, they can't! We've convinced them
that they want to stay in America.


KYLE
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks
and malls. How can you expect them to
go back now??

RANDY
I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having
them taken away on Easter Sunday. We...
don't have a choice. Sorry, girls.


STAN
Now what do we do?

[The Marsh house, outside, day. Several days have passed, and
now the protest crowd is larger, and news cameras are present]


REPORTER
Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as
the U.S. government promised, they are
here to take the girls back to their
father in Romania. Rumor has it that
Janet Reno herself will be extraditing
the quintuplets.

SOLDIER
Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the
plan.

JANET RENO
Right.

SOLDIER
We'll drop you on the northwest corner
of the backyard. You hop into the back
of the house and find the quintuplets.
When you see them, you say...

JANET RENO
"Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."


SOLDIER
Good. And then hand them the Easter
eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?


JANET RENO
Ready.

SOLDIER
Code blue!

JANET RENO
Code blue!

[Romanian School of Music, day. Kenny is heard singing. He is
onstage as his song ends, and his mom joins him with three other
people]

MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Lad, we would like very much to have
you here at the Romanina Music School.


KENNY
(Woohoo!)

MRS. MCCORMICK
How much is all this gonna cost?

MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania
is very poor country. Apartment is cheap.
Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because
we are so God-damned poor.

ASSISTANT
Yes, your two hundred American dollars
will last months here.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Wow, what a great country. Everybody's
poor, like us.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

[The Marsh house, day. Protesters and police mill around the
front yard]

JANET RENO
Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny.
Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I
brought for ya.

PHILLIP
Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart.


TERRANCE
Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.


QUINT 2
Oh, look. An Easter egg.

RANDY
Oh, shi-

LEAD SOLDIER
That's it. Let's move, move move move,
move!  Give us the kids, now! Now!


OFFICER 1
Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned
floor!

OFFICER 2
Find them!

JANET RENO
This is a bust! Hand over the quints!
Hand over the children! Happy Easter.
Hand over the children!!

GRANDPA
What the hell's goin' on?!

OFFICER 3

Damnit, now I'm never gonna have my
own circus!

[Romanian School of Music, day. Kenny performs in front of a
full house. He finishes his song and the audience erupts in applause.
Roses rain down upon him as he takes his bow.]

MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick.
The people of Romania love him.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Good job, Kenny.

MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Mrs.McCormick, we would love for you
and your son to stay here in Romania,
with us. Wwill you consider it?

MRS. MCCORMICK
Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd
have to leave your friends and your
family behind.

KENNY
(Sure!)

MUSIC INSTRUCTOR
Alright!

[The Marsh house, day. The protesters leave one by one. The Marshes
stand in the bombed-out ruins]

SHARON
Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!


CARTMAN
Dude, what the hell happened?

STAN
The government came and got the quintuplets.
No more Cirque du Cheville for us.


KYLE
Damnit! How come every time we get a
sweet idea, the government has to screw
it up?!

STAN
Yeah! Well, not this time!

CARTMAN
Huh?

STAN
We've just gotta get that angry mob
back on our side!  Alright, everybody,
listen up! Those bastards broke in here
and took those poor quintuplets to the
mayor's office downtown! But they haven't
won yet! I say we all go over to the
mayor's office, and demand to see the
quintuplets right now!

PROTESTER 1
Hmm.

PROTESTER 2
Yeaahh.

PROTESTER 3
I don't know. I usually like to stop
protesting by 5:30.

PROTESTER 4
Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?


STAN
Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.


PROTESTER 5
Alright!

PROTESTER 6
Yeah!

PROTESTER 7
Down with Japan!

[An office. Janet Reno and the two officers meet the Mayor and
her aides for a photo-op. The photographer takes his shot.]


JANET RENO
Alright. We just need to get a few more
pictures of the girls reunited with
their father so everyone knows they're
happy.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Come on, girls. Smile.  We want you
to look happy. Smile.  Look at the silly
frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look
at him. I've got- Look at him. It's
silly. "I'm so silly."

[Romania, day. A news report on TV]

STUART
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back
in America. I miss my son very much.
I would like to see him returned to
me so that the U.S. government will
buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec-
because I miss my son very much.  Man.


[A United States Air Force checkpoint, later. Cartman, Kyle,
and Stan approach, and a soldier intervenes]

STAN
Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!


SOLDIER
You can't see them, boys. They're happily
reunited with their father.

STAN
Come on, angry mob!

SOLDIER
Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.

[The USAF office. Reno has taken her mask off and stands next
to the girls. Behind her are six officers, and next to them are
the two Romanian officials and Mr. Vladchick.]

ROMANIAN OFFICIAL
Alright, it is time for us to return
to Romania.

JANET RENO
What is that?

OFFICER 7
It's the protesters. They're back.


JANET RENO
God-damnit! We'll take care of them.
Come on!

OFFICER 8
Let's move. Move!

OFFICER 7
Come on, come on, come on.

OFFICER 9
Come oonn, come oonn.

OFFICER 10
This is government property!

PROTESTER
Let the quints stay!

SHARON
You ruined my house!

QUINT 1
What are you doing, Nadia?

NADIA
I'm calling the only person in the vorld
who can help us.

[A USAF airfield, later. Protesters and officers are still brawling.
Stan and Kyle each kick an officer on the shin.]

CARTMAN
Take that!

QUINT 3
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

QUINT 1
All of you are acting like idiots!


STAN
Yeah.

QUINT 1
None of you care about us. You only
care about yourselves!

QUINT 2
Look at you, Father. You walked out
on us five years ago , and now you act
like you miss us sooo much! You are
a liar and a fake!

CARTMAN
Yeah, you suck, dude!

QUINT 3
And you Romanian leaders , you don't
care about us! All you care about is
making America look stupid!

CARTMAN
Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!

QUINT 3
And you protesters! Don't you have anything
better to do?! Get a life!

CARTMAN
Yeah!

QUINT 3
And you boys are the worst of all!


STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Huh?

QUINT 3
You know nothing about Romania, and
yet you assume America is so much better!
Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America,
but it is our home! We are Romanian!
All you care about is your own stupid
circus!

JANET RENO
Where are you going, girls?

QUINT 1
The only place we can go. We're going
on Oprah and then a book tour.

QUINT 5
Yes. You can all kiss our little white
Romanian asses!

STAN
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a
dumb idea anyways.

CARTMAN
Yeah, screw them!

KYLE
Kenny was never gonna get his singing
right anyway.

STAN
Whatever happened to Kenny?

[Romania, day. Romanian protesters with signs bearing a picture
of Kenny's head lobby in front of the house Kenny's in.]

ROMANIAN PROTESTERS
Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let
Kenny stay!

OFFICER 1
Alright, people, the father wants his
son returned to him! Hand him over to
us!

ROMANIAN PROTESTERS
Boooo!

OFFICER 2
Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's
go. Move move move move!

OFFICER 3
Hand over the boy, now!

MRS. MCCORMICK
Okay, okay!

OFFICER 3
I mean it, lady, you've got about-!
Woops.

"CARTMAN'S SILLY HATE CRIME 2000"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, Monday during the day. The kids are out
on the playground. The camera pans to the right, showing kids
on the hobby elephants, the swings, and the jungle gym. It rests
on Butters holding a starting flag.]

BUTTERS
Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?


Sledders	[three teams of four boys apiece] Ready!

BUTTERS
On your marks! Get set! Uh-go!

STAN
We win again!

TOKEN
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so
fat he makes your sled go faster!


CARTMAN
Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!

GIRL IN PINK
We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!


STAN
Sleds are for guys.

CARTMAN
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some
dishes or get pregnant or something?!


GIRL IN PINK
These are the school's sleds, ass rammers,
not yours!

STAN
Look, girls don't even know how to sled.
Do something else.

THE REST OF THE BOYS
Yeah!

GIRL IN PINK
I bet we can sled ten times better than
you, doughnut punchers!

KYLE
Oh yeah?!

THE GIRLS
Yeah!

CARTMAN
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!


GIRL IN PINK
How about a race down a real hill, then?!


THE GIRLS
Yeah!

STAN
You got it!

THE REST OF THE BOYS
Yeah!

A FEW OTHERS
Yeah!

GIRL IN PINK
Your best four sledders agains our best
four sledders!

STAN
Noo problem!

GIRL IN PINK
Then we'll see you this Saturday on
Phil Collins Hill!

KYLE
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got
it!

GIRL IN PINK
See you there! And may the best woman
win, turd burglars!

STAN
Oh, boy! We'll show them!

BUTTERS
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those
skanky hos who's who!

CLYDE
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what
good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny
are.

TOKEN
Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously
fat ass, the boys are sure to win!


CARTMAN
Token, I swear to God, if you call me
fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you
on the head with this rock!

KYLE
Fatass.

CARTMAN
There!

TOKEN
Oh!

CARTMAN
Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.

[Mr. Mackey's office, some time later. Eric and Token are seated
inside. Token's right arm is in a sling and his right eye is
blackened]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
And what you need to understand is that
this is not appropriate behavior, young
man! M'kay?

LIANE
Eric, don't you realize you could've
seriously injured your little friend?


CARTMAN
I'm sorry, Mom.

LIANE
Don't apologize to us, apologize to
him!

CARTMAN
I'm sorry, Token.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well, I hope you learned that throwing
rocks is bayad, Eric.

CARTMAN
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I
feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?
The only thing I can do now... is try
to go on and live day by day.  See ya
later.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Not this time, Eric! You've got to
learn to respect your lttle friends!
You're gonna have detention for two
weeks!

CARTMAN
No way!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it!
Now, let's all go-

MAN 1
Counselor Mackey?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Yes?

MAN 1
I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen.
We're with  the FBI.

AGENT KEEN
We're here to investigate the rock-throwing
incident.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken
care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna
be punished with two weeks of detention.


AGENT SHARP
I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated
than that, Mr. School Counselor.You
see, since the victim in this case is
African-American, this is considered
a hate crime.

CARTMAN
...What the hell is a hate crime?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a
ruh-

AGENT KEEN
New laws have been passed that make
any crime based on race, ethnicity,
or sexual orientation a federal offense.


CARTMAN
What? A federal offense?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh no.

CARTMAN
Oh no??

AGENT KEEN
We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must
follow protocol.  Your son will be taken
into custody and then tried in a federal
court of law.

LIANE
Oh my goodness.

[Trial TV, Tuesday. The letters fly into place over blind Justice
holding the scales]

ANNOUNCER
The hate crime trial of the century
is underway  on Court TV tracks U van.
. Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith.


LESLIE
What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old
boy into a vicious, hate-crime-commiting
racist? We take you live to the courtroom
as the defendant takes the stand.


[The courtroom. The prosecutor grills Cartman]

PROSECUTOR
Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the
name of "Token?"

CARTMAN
Uh, yes?

PROSECUTOR
Who is Token?

CARTMAN
He's a black kid that goes to my school?


PROSECUTOR
Black!  Did you say black?! You called
him black?!

CARTMAN
He is black.

PROSECUTOR
O! He said it again!  He is African-American,
and so you decided to pick him out!


CARTMAN
I did?

PROSECUTOR
The rage built and built inside your
head until it became too much because
you hate African-Americans!!

CARTMAN
No! I hate hippies!

PROSECUTOR
What?!

CARTMAN
I hate hippies! I mean, the way they
always talk about "protectin' the earth"
and then drive around in cars that get
poor gas mileage and wear those stupid
bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick
'em in the nuts!

LIANE
Oo, poopiekins?

PROSECUTOR
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this
is why we have hate-crime laws! This
"monster" commited a crimenot against
an individual, but against a race! Do
the democratic thing and send his fat
little butt to prison!

CARTMAN
Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!

PROSECUTOR
The prosecution rests.

GIRL IN PINK
Don't forget: we still have a sledding
race this Saturday, pillow biters.


STAN, KYLE
We know!

STAN
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get
Cartman out of court so we can go practice.


[The courtroom, some time later. A verdict has been reached,
and the Judge announces it.]

JUDGE
Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty
of commiting a hate crime. For this,
I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa
Juvenile Hall, until you turn twen-ty
one.

CARTMAN
No!

JUDGE
I am making an example of you, to send
a message out to people everywhere:
that if you want to hurt another human
being, you'd better make damn sure they're
the same color as you are!  Court is
adjourned!

THE GIRLS
Woohoo! Hooray!

JUDGE
Bailiffs, escort this little bastard
to Juvenile Hall.

BLACK BAILIFF
Yes, sir.

WHITE BAILIFF
Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he
go?

[Kenny's house. Cartman rushes up to it and pounds on the front
door. Kenny opens the door]

CARTMAN
Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out
of town!

KENNY
(What the fuck for?!)

CARTMAN
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate
crime! You have to take me to Mexico!


KENNY
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to
take you all the way to Mexico?!)


CARTMAN
Calm down, Kenny!

KENNY
(Hey!)

CARTMAN
Do you still have that battery-powered
toy truck you got last Christmas?!


KENNY
(Yyes)

CARTMAN
Well, come on! I don't have much time!


[NEWS FLASH
"High Speed Chase"]

ANCHOR
A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor
east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect
Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal
prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action
Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins
is there live. Greg?

GREG NIMINS
Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action
Bronco is heading east on 285. Police
officers are right behind him  but as
with any chase, they're keeping a safe
distance to avoid any accidents here
out on the highway.  Tom, it looks like
the fugitive is going to make a bold
move off an exit off 285. He's going
into a residential neighborhood now;
this is where it could get dangerous,
as there are pedestrians about.

[In the Go-Go Action Bronco]

CARTMAN
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any
faster?!

KENNY
(Why don'tcha keep your head down?!)


[back to the report]

GREG NIMINS
Tom, the police have set a roadblock
right where the Go-Go Action Bronco
is heading.  This could be the final
stand-off.

POLICEMAN 1
Alright, that's far enough. Stop the
Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with
your hands up.  Just bring it to a stop
and come on out.  Jeezus, he's gonna
ram it!  Crazy son of a bitch.

[NEWS FLASH
Continuing coverage. Stan and Kyle watch
the news flash at Stan's house]

GREG NIMINS
Well, it's been over thirteen hours
now, and still the car chase has not
ended.

KYLE
What the hell are they doing?

GREG NIMINS
The chase has now moved through most
of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.


STAN
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico,
how are we ever gonna win the sledding
race on Saturday?

KYLE
Don't worry, dude. That little truck
just runs on D batteries. It's gonna
run out of juice soon.

[The Arizona desert]

CARTMAN
:	We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're
gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God damnit!


[Stan's house. The phone rings]

STAN
Hello?

GIRL IN PINK
Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's
going to jail and you've got four days
until the race, rump rangers!

STAN
Son of a bitch!

[A truck arrives at the main gates of a prison in the desert.
The gates part and the truck enters]

DRIVER
Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa
Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.

[A few moments later, and Cartman is in an orange prison suit
being admitted]

WARDEN
Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward,
prisoner! You will wake up each morning
at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At
ten we begin random searches and checks
for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime,
followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate
is Romper Stomper!

CARTMAN
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?

ROMPER STOMPER
I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate!


WARDERN
You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now,
show this new prisoner the ropes!


ROMPER STOMPER
Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will.


STAN
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's
not gonna be able to sled with us for
another... 13 years, so in the meantime
we need someone to race with us against
the girls on Saturday.

KYLE
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave
us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest
kid besides Cartman.

STAN
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid
in South Park?

BUTTERS
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest
uh-kid.

CLYDE
Huh?

KYLE
Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.

CLYDE
I'm not fat.

STAN
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone,
so now you're the fat kid.

KYLE
Yeah, fatss! Get your fat butt on the
sled!

CLYDE
Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just
kind of big-boned.

STAN
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay,
ready? Go!

KYLE
Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have
enough weight to move.

GIRL IN PINK
See you Saturday, poo sniffers!

STAN
Nice going, fat boy!

[Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Some of the kids gather around Cartman.]


ROMPER STOMPER
Well, well, well. Nwe fish. How about
you come up with a reason why we don't
break your arms?!

INMATES
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm
one of you.

ROMPER STOMPER
Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two
kinds of kids in the world: kids who
like Animaniacs, and kids who don't
like Animaniacs. You're either with
us, or you're against us. So which are
you?!

CARTMAN
Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh,
I... don't like Animaniacs?

ROMPER STOMPER
...Neither do we

CARTMAN
Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends
now?

ROMPER STOMPER
No! There's no friends in the Big House!
You come in with nobody and you leave
with nobody. We don't believe in "friends."


INMATES
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.

ROMPER STOMPER
Now, go find me some cigarettes and
I'll tell you how to bust out of here.


[Phil Collins Hill, second practice run. Kyle and Kenny add the
finishing touches to something on the sled]

STAN
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more
weight to the sled, we're gonna use
these bricks , but we're gonna cover
'em with kid's clothes so that the girls
think it's another kid!

PIP
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

CLYDE
So I don't get to be on the team now?


ALL THE BOYS
Shut up, fatass!

KYLE
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more
pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?!


STAN
Come on, let's get it a try.

KENNY, STAN
Woopee!

STAN
Yeah-

STAN, KENNY, KYLE
Wo-o-o-o-oh!

STAN
Dude, bail! Bail!

KENNY
(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)


STAN
Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.

KYLE
We killed Kenny?

STAN
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.

KYLE
Well, that didn't work. What else can
we try?

STAN
Nothing else is gonna work.  We have
to face the fact that without Cartman
we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.


BUTTERS
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see
my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!


PIP
This is a sad day for men everywhere.


STAN
You know something, guys? I think we
all took Cartman's ass for granted.


ALL THE BOYS
Yeup.

KYLE
If only we had realized how special
our time with his gigantic ass was.


BUTTERS
Well, all that time we didn't understand
what a... unique and magical ass it was.


GIRL IN PINK
Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee.
Looks like you lost another sledder.
Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers!


STAN
That does it! We've got no other choice!
We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!


SOME BOYS
Oh?

OTHER BOYS
Huh?

KYLE
How?

STAN
I saw a movie once where they baked
a cake and put a nail file inside of
it.

KYLE
Sweet! Let's go!

THE GROUP
Hooray! Alright! Here we go!

MOTHER 1
And have you been brushing your teeth?


BOY 1
Yes, Mommy.

MOTHER 1
And not dropping your soap?

BOY 1
Yes, Mommy.

BOY 2
Hi, Mom.

MOTHER 2
Young man, that is the fourth time you've
been late for our visiting time; you
are grounded.

BOY 2
Grounded? On, no! Um, wait...

GUARD
Here you go, boys. Keep it short.


CARTMAN
Hey you guys.

KYLE
Hey, fatass. How's prison?

CARTMAN
Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?


STAN
Cartman, why the hell did you have to
commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose
to girls because of you!

KYLE
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here.
So we made you this cake.  There's
a ailnay ilefay inside of it.

CARTMAN
A what?

KYLE
An ailnay ilefay.

CARTMAN
Wwhat's that?

KYLE
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so

STAN

CARTMAN
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but

KYLE
They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?!
It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this
Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're

STAN
...Yeah.

CARTMAN
Look, that's not important right now!
Did you guys bring the cigarettes?


KYLE
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we
don't think you should be smoking. Each
year, over a million people die of smo-


CARTMAN
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!


STAN
Sshh!

CARTMAN
Look, if you guys want me back to win
the sledding race,  then I need those
cigarettes.

STAN
How are we supposed to give them to
you?

CARTMAN
Just pass them through these little
drill holes here. That's what everybody
does.

STAN
But they're gonna search you on your
way back to your cell.

CARTMAN
I know. That's why I have to have them
up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's
not funny!

STAN
Alright, here.

CARTMAN
Well, okay... here... l'see...

STAN
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here
and watched that.

KYLE
Me too.

CARTMAN
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me,
I must be going now.

KYLE
Don't fart on your way out; you might
make little smoke signals.

CARTMAN
Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah.


[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, outside the main gate. Stan and Kyle
exit and Stan sets the cake on the ground.]

STAN
That sucks that we couldn't give him
the nail file.

KYLE
So now what do we do?

STAN
There's only one thing we can do. We
have to go see Token and see if he'll
forgive Cartman for hate-criming him.
Come on, we're running out of time!


[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Cartman's cell. He enters]

ROMPER STOMPER
Well, did you get the cigarettes?


CARTMAN
Yes. They are safely concealed in the
depths of my ass.

ROMPER STOMPER
Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop
them out. I'll keep an eye out for the
guards.

CARTMAN
Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes.
One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come
on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh.
Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit!


ROMPER STOMPER
You flushed them?!

CARTMAN
Well, you spend eight years takin' a
crap and then flushin' the toilet; it
sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just
help me bust out of here.

ROMPER STOMPER
No way, douche. I told you: I ain't
your friend. If you want me to help
you, you're gonna have to sneak something
else in for me.

CARTMAN
Son of a bitch!

[South Park, Friday during the day. Stan and Kyle get off a bus
onto an affluent part of town]

KYLE
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far
away.

STAN
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from
different races to our school to promote
cultural diversity.

KYLE
Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?


STAN
Yeah.

TOKEN'S MOTHER
Hello?

STAN
Hi. Can Token come out and play?

TOKEN'S MOTHER
Well, his head is still a little sore,
but you can come in, if you like.


KYLE
Killer.

STAN
Token, you don't wanna see us guys
lose to girls tomorrow, do you?

TOKEN
No.

KYLE
Well then,  you've got to call the jail
right now and tell them that you forgive
Cartman for being a dumbass!

TOKEN
Yeah.

TOKEN'S FATHER
I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.


STAN
It's not?

TOKEN'S FATHER
No. You see, the only person that can
let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the
governor.

KYLE
Damnit! Son of a bitch, damnit!  Oh,
sorry.

TOKEN'S FATHER
No, I'b, actually agree with you.

KYLE
Huh?

TOKEN'S FATHER
Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime
legislation. In fact, I'd love to see
you kids go down and give the governor
a piece of my mind.

STAN
Well, why don't you tell the governor
yourself?

TOKEN'S FATHER
Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.

KYLE
Why not?

TOKEN'S FATHER
Because I'm black.

STAN, KYLE
Oh.

TOKEN'S FATHER
Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a
little lesson about hate-crime laws.


[Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Cartman is at the toilet pooping something
else. Romper is reading]

CARTMAN
Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus,
uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!


ROMPER STOMPER
Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game.
Ew, it smells, man.

CARTMAN
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?!
Now I got your stupid game; tell me
how to break out of here!

ROMPER STOMPER
You're not gonna break out of here!
You're here 'til you're 21, douche!


CARTMAN
But you said-

ROMPER STOMPER
I just wanted you to sneak stuff in
for me. What? You actually think I give
a crap about you?

CARTMAN
I thought that-

ROMPER STOMPER
Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way
things work in the big house.  Hey guys!
I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah,
it's a little ripe, but it's brand new,
man! You can play it at recess.  Hey.
Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't
cry in prison, man. They'll bust your
head open. What's the matter with you?!


CARTMAN
I want my Mo-omm

ROMPER STOMPER
Dude.

CARTMAN
Mommy, I want my Mommy!

ROMPER STOMPER
Look, if it's that important to you,
I'll bust you out of here.

CARTMAN
You will?

ROMPER STOMPER
Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because
you're my friend. Only because... because
I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and
see Disneyland.

[The governor's office, day. An aide peeks in]

AIDE
Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now
Committee is here to see you?

GOVERNOR
Naw, not another committee. Send them
in.  This is the Free Eric Cartman Now
Committee?

TOKEN
Yeah.

GOVERNOR
Well, boys, what can I do for you?


STAN
Okay, go ahead and start.

KYLE
I don't start, you start.

STAN
Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and
thank you for taking the time to hear
our presentation on hate-crime laws,
entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage
Hypocracy."  Yes, over the past few
years our great country has been developing
new hate crime laws.

TOKEN
If somebody kills somebody, it's a
crime. But if someone kills somebody
of a different color, it's a hate crime.


KYLE
And we think that that is  a savage
hypocracy, because all crimes are hate
crimes. If a man beats another man because
that man was sleeping with his wife,
is that not a hate crime?

STAN
If a person vandalizes a government
building, is it not because of his hate
for the government?

TOKEN
And motivation for a crime shouldn't
affect the sentencing.

STAN
Mayor, it is time to stop splitting
people into groups. All hate crimes
do is support the idea that blacks are
different from whites, that homosexuals
need to be treated differently from
non-homos, that we aren't the same.


KYLE
But instead, we should all be treated
the same, with the same laws and the
same punishments for the same crimes
. For in that way Cartman can be freed
from prison, and we  will have a chance
to win the sledding race on Thursday.


STAN
That is our presentation. An idea that
we call...

TOKEN
"Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocracy."


GOVERNOR
Hm. That made the most sense of any
presentation I've heard in the last
three years.

[Outside Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Friday night. Alarms sound and
searchlights abound, indicating someone has broken out. Footsteps
are heard, and Cartman and Romper climb over a hill]

ROMPER STOMPER
Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after
us!  Mph. Oowww!

CARTMAN
What's the matter?

ROMPER STOMPER
It's my leg! I think it's broken.
You go on ahead without me.

CARTMAN
Uhokay.

ROMPER STOMPER
Hey.  You're supposed to say, "I'm not
going without you," or something.


CARTMAN
Oh. Really?

ROMPER STOMPER
Look, kid, you go on. You've got something
to live out there. You've got friends.


CARTMAN
Yeah. I never really realized that until
just now.

ROMPER STOMPER
I sure would have liked to have seen
Disneyland. Here. I want you to have
these.

CARTMAN
Okay.

ROMPER STOMPER
No! You're supposed to say, "I can't
take these," or something, dumbass!


CARTMAN
Oh. I can't take these.

ROMPER STOMPER
Take them. They'll bring you luck.
Now go on. Get out of here.

CARTMAN
Romper?

ROMPER STOMPER
Yeah?

CARTMAN
You... well... I know you don't think you've...
ever been anybody's friend, but, well,
you're a friend to me.

GUARD
Alright, freeze!

CARTMAN
You'll never take us alive! We're going
down together, pigs!

GUARD
But you've been pardoned by the governor!


CARTMAN
O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes.

[Phil Collins Hill, Saturday. The sledders are at the top of
the run and other kids are at the finish line]

GIRL IN PINK
Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!


STAN
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned;
he'll be here any second.

KYLE
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.


GIRL IN PINK
Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge
packers!

BEBE
Yeah. If you're too scared to race,
just say so!

KYLE
Dude, I guess we've jsut got to try
it without him.

STAN
Alright, where's Clyde.

CLYDE
Right here.

STAN
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!


CLYDE
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop
calling me fat, God-damnit!

KYLE
On the sled, fatass!

GIRL IN PINK
Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what
we can do!

OTHER GIRLS
Yeah!

BUTTERS
Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-

CARTMAN
You guys!

STAN
It's Cartman!

BOY SLEDDERS
Hooray!

CARTMAN
That's right! I'm back!

CLYDE
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming
back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.


CARTMAN
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?

GIRL IN PINK
This is your last chance! Are we racing
or not?!

STAN
All right! Let's do this!

BUTTERS
Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.


CARTMAN
I hope I can adjust to life outside
of the big house.

BUTTERS
Uh-get set. Go!

CARTMAN
Been on the inside for so long, I don't
rermember how to live on the outside.


KYLE
Go, fatass!

CARTMAN
When a man is stripped of his freedom,
degraded in the ways that I was, it's-


TOKEN, KYLE, STAN
Go, fatass!

STAN
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them!


GIRL IN PINK
We've got' em, girls!

KYLE
Oh no! The girls are gonna win!

KIDS AT FINISH LINE
Go! You can do it! Come on!

STAN
We're not gonna make it!

CARTMAN
Hey.

GIRL IN PINK
G'aaaaah!

BEAR
Rowr. {carries the girl in pink away]


BOY SLEDDERS
Hooray!

STAN
We did it!

GIRLS
Awww.

KYLE
We won! We won!

BUTTERS
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky
bitches what for!

BOYS
Hooray!

KYLE
It's good to have you back, Cartman.


STAN
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass
for granted ever again.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends
for granted ever again.

PIP
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big,
fat ass!  Oh-ff.

CARTMAN
Do British people count as an ethnicity
for hate crimes?

CARTMAN
Sweet.

[Alamosa Juvenile Hall, later, Romper's cell. He is reading]


GUARD
Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up!  You got
a visitor!

ROMPER STOMPER
Eric!

CARTMAN
Hey, Romper Stomper.

ROMPER STOMPER
Wow! I've never had a visitor before!


CARTMAN
Well, that's not all. I snuck something
in for you, too.

ROMPER STOMPER
You did?

CARTMAN
You know how you told me you always
wanted to see Disneyland?

ROMPER STOMPER
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean.
Ugh.

ROMPER STOMPER
Whoa!

CARTMAN
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.
Ogh! Wait-

ROMPER STOMPER
Oh, yeah!

CARTMAN
Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that
comes now-oh!

ROMPER STOMPER
Oh, the monorail!

"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 709


"CHRISTIAN ROCK HARD"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Stan and the boys are in the Marsh garage belting out tunes,
but their musical styles are scattered. Cartman sings lead, Stan
and Kyle on are guitars, Kenny is on the drums]

CARTMAN
God damnit!

RANDY
Stan, are you okay?

STAN
Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our
band.

RANDY
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese
people were having their intestines
pulled out through their mouths.


CARTMAN
Heheheheheh heheheheheh.

KYLE
He's right, dude. We have to define
our style if we're ever going to make
a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion
guy, but Kenny's background is more
Latin Jazz.

KENNY
(What? Is it?)

STAN
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B
oriented.

KYLE
I think out band better buy a whole
bunch of music CDs to listen to for
inspiration.

CARTMAN
Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's
it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you
see?

STAN
See what?

CARTAMN
Our band should play Christian rock!


KYLE
Christian rock?!

CARTMAN
Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest
music in the world, right? If we just
play songs about how much we love Jesus,
all the Christiand will buy our crap!


KYLE
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!

CARTMAN
It worked for Creed!

STAN
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian
rock band!

CARTMAN
You just start that way, Stan, then
you cross over. It's genious!

KYLE
Just get the hell out of here, Cartman!
You're not serious and you're a detriment
to the band!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that
if I start a Christian rock band that
I can get a platinum album before you
guys do!

KYLE
You're on, fat boy!

CARTMAN
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have
a platinum album wins! Go!

KYLE
What a stupid asshole!

[The neighborhood, day. Cartman runs through the streets. He
appears over a rise on one of the streets]

CARTMAN
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta
make a platinum album before Kyle!


BUTTERS
Oh, hi Eric.

CARTMAN
Butters! Get your drum set and meet
me at my house! We have to make a platinum
album! Hurry, Butters!

BUTTERS
...Ohhh!

[Token's mansion. Cartman runs up to the front door]

CARTMAN
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must
beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar
out of your basement and meet me over
at my house!

TOKEN
What?! We don't have a bass guitar.


CARTMAN
Your family's black, Token! There's
bound to be a bass guitar in your basement
somewhere!

[Cartman's house. He and Butters are in the living room. Cartman
is at the piano, Butters is on drums.]

BUTTERS
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You
must have some... ih-inspiration.


CARTMAN
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when
he loses his ten dollars to me.

TOKEN
Hey, there was a bass guitar in my
basement.

CARTMAN
I told you, Token.

TOKEN
So, what are we doing?

CARTMAN
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on
the most amazing, life-affirming, financially-windfalling
experiences of our young lives.

BUTTERS
Wow!

CARTMAN
We are going to start... a Christian
rock band.

BUTTERS
Awww.

TOKEN
I'm out.

CARTMAN
Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and
you'll regret it the rest of your life!
Christians have a built-in audience
of over one hundred and eighty million
Americans! If each one of them buys
just one of our albums at twelve dollars
and ninety-five cents that would be-


BUTTERS
Two billion, three hundred and thirty
one million dollars.

CARTMAN
Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.


[The Broflovski house, living room. Gerald and Sheila are on
the sofa. Gerald reads a book, Sheila is knitting]

KYLE
Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?


KYLE'S FATHER
Three hundred dollars?? What in the
world for??

KYLE
Our band can't find a stylistic direction
to go in. We need to go down to the
mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen
to so we can define our sound.

KYLE'S FATHER
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance
already.

KYLE
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream??
Music is my life!

KYLE'S FATHER
It wasn't your life yesterday.

KYLE
Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside
me. It's in my soul. And I know my place
is up on that stage. I'm gonna make
it to the top. And I just want your
blessing, Pops.

KYLE'S FATHER
The answer is no, Kyle.

KYLE
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, don't belittle your own people!


KYLE
Aaaargh!

STAN
Hey dude.

KYLE
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't
lend me money for CDs!

STAN
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you
can download music for free on the Internet!


KYLE
Really?

KENNY
(Yeah!)

STAN
You got a computer?

[Stan's Dad's den, moments later. The boys are at the computer.
Stan works the keyboard as Kyle and Kenny watch.]

STAN
See? Everyone on the Internet copies
their music from their CDs, and then
we can download them for free and play
them on the computer!

KYLE
All right, cool.  Let's donwload some
Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder.


KENNY
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)


STAN
Kenny's right. We should download some
Judas Priest, too.

KYLE
Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music
for free is awesome!

STAN
What the hell is that?

KYLE
I don't know.  Let me go check.

AGENT 1
Freeze!! FBI!!

AGENT 2
Down on the ground! Down on the ground!


AGENT 3
Hurry up! Let me see those hands!


AGENT 2
Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects
in custody!

AGENT 4
Move move move move move move! All clear,
men!  Get your ass going!

AGENT 5
Move move move move move move! Move!


KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, what did you do?!

KYLE
I don't know!

[Cartman's house. He, Token and Butters begin to practice]

CARTMAN
All right, guys, this is gonna be so
easy. All we have to do to make Christian
songs is take regular old songs and
add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we
have to do is cross out words like "baby"
and "Darling" and replace them with
Jesus. All right, Butters, give me
a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All
right, Token, give me a smooth bass
line.

TOKEN
I don't know how to play bass.

CARTMAN
Token, how many times do we have to
go through this? You're black. You can
play bass.

TOKEN
I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!


CARTMAN
Be as sick as you want, just give me
a God-damned bass line!

TOKEN
God-damnit!

CARTMAN
All right. Nice, fellas. Nice.

I need you in my life, Jesus.

I can't live without you, Jesus

And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.

BUTTERS
Well done!

[United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, day. Inside,
a detective reviews some reports on the boys' Internet activity.
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait on the other side of the table]


KYLE
Um, sir-

DETECTIVE
Shiut up!!  You downloaded a lot of
songs! Says here you even downlaoded
Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys
are lookin' at. You got anything to
say for yourselves?

KYLE
We d-didn't think it was that big a
deal.

DETECTIVE
Not a big deal! You think downloading
music for free is not a big deal?! Put
your couts on! I'm gonna show you something!
And I don't think you're gonna like
it!

[A mansion, somewhere, day. The agent has taken the boys for
a ride and arrived here. He leads them to the main gate]

DETECTIVE
This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the
drummer for Metallica.  Look. There's
Lars now, sitting by his pool.

KYLE
What's the matter with him?

DETECTIVE
This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated
shark tank bar installed right next
to the pool, but thanks to people downloading
his music for free, he must now wait
a few months before he can afford it.
Come. There's more.  Here's Britney
Spears' private jet. Notice anything?
Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV.
Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream
III because people like you chose to
download her music for free.  The Gulfstream
III doesn't even have a remote control
for its surround-sound DVD system. Still
think downloading music for free is
no big deal?

KYLE
We... didn't realize what we were doing,
eh...

DETECTIVE
That is the folly of man. Now look in
this window.  Here you see the loving
family of Master P.  Next week is his
son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted
was an island in French Polynesia.


KYLE
So, he's gonna get it, right?

DETECTIVE
I see an island without an owner. If
things keep going the way they are,
the child will not get his tropical
paradise.

STAN
We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download
music for free again!

DETECTIVE
Man must learn to think of these horrible
outcomes before he acts selfishly or
else... I fear... recording artists
will be forever doomed to a life of
only semi-luxury.

[Some bluffs by a beach, dawn. Cartman, Token and Butters scramble
over some boulders to get to the beach. Seagulls fly overhead]


CARTMAN
Almost there, you guys.

BUTTERS
Ow...

TOKEN
Why the hell did you tell us to dress
nice to take us out here?

CARTMAN
Because, Token, we have to take pictures
for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling
Christian album is a flashy inspirational
album cover.

BUTTERS
Wow, neato! An album cover!

TOKEN
This Christian album better make as
much money as you said it would, tubby!


CARTMAN
I'm going to kill you one day, Token.


TOKEN
What did you say?!

CARTMAN
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over
there and look wholesome and cool. I
have a timer on this thing so I can
get in the shot too.

BUTTERS
Cheese!

CARTMAN
No no no! Haven't you guys ever seen
an album cover? You're supposed to be
standing in random places, looking away
like you don't care!

BUTTERS
Cheese!

CARTMAN
No! Butters, you can't look happy on
the album cover! That's not cool!


BUTTERS
Oh...

CARTMAN
Token, look away to the right.  More.
More!

TOKEN
Why the hell would I be looking way
over there??

CARTMAN
So it looks like you're too cool to
care that you're on an album cover,
you black asshole! Now just hold it!
Our first album cover.

Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.


My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that
door.

I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.


[The FBI building, next day. The parents have shown up to retrieve
the boys]

KYLE'S FATHER
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective.
Sorry for all the trouble they caused.


DETECTIVE
It's all right. I think these boys learned
their lesson.

STAN
Boy, I'll say!

DETECTIVE
If you parents will just step over here,
you can pay their four hundred dollar
release and penalty fees.

RANDY
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading
some songs off the Internet? It's not
that big a deal.

DETECTIVE
Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me!
I'm gonna show you something! And I
don't think you're gonna like it!


STAN
Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go
back home and get back to band practice.


KENNY
(Yeah)

KYLE
No! Didn't you guys learn anything?
Look, if we make an album, all that's
gonna happen is that people are gonna
steal our songs for free off the Internet.
We won't make a dime!

STAN
Oh yeah.

KYLE
Until we get people to stop downloading
music for free, I say we refuse to play!


KENNY
(Yeah!)

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado,
where the rock band, MOOP, has refused
to play. The strike started yesterday
and could go well into next week.


CARTMAN
Oh hey guys. How's it going?

KYLE
We're not letting you back in the band,
Cartman! Fuck off!

CARTMAN
I don't wanna be in your crappy band,
guys. I just wanted to let you know,
the album for my Christian rock band,
Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.


STAN
It is??

CARTMAN
That's right. We already sold thirteen
copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar
bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha
ha ha!

KYLE
You get a platinum album for selling
one million copies, you fat turd!


CARTMAN
It's just a matter of time, my friends.
This weekend is Christfest. The single
largest gathering of Christians in the
Midwest. Each one of them a walkng,
praying wallet full of cash. And I'll
be there selling my album.

KYLE
You'll never get a platinum album doing
Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid
idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!


STAN
Yeah, you don't even know anything about
Christianity.

CARTMAN
I know enough to exploit it. Just get
that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Tata!


KYLE
Go ahead! People will just download
your songs for free on the Internet
anyways!

STAN
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler
than his.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

[Christ-fest, night. A stadium's parking lot is crowded with
all sorts of booths selling stuff.]

T-SHIRT VENDOR
Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your
favorite psalm!

BIBLE VENDOR
Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.


CARTMAN
Yes, it's really the best Christian
album that's evern been produced, actually..


ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren.
They need hip cool music, but with inspirational
lyrics.

CARTMAN
I think that's what the whole world
needs, praise Christ.

BUTTERS
Huh we're not really Christians, we're
just pretendin' we are.

CARTMAN
Butters, remind me later to cut your
balls off.

MC
All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest
2003!  are you ready for some live music?


A MAN
Yeah Jesus!

MC
Then let's give it up now for one of
Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity!


TRINITY
The Shepherd and the Light, and His
Word lifted me up

And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.

CARTMAN
Damnit! If we're gonna sell our hot
Christian album, we have got to get
on that stage!

BAND MEMBER 1
Hey is this the way to the backstage?


CARTMAN
Who are you?

BAND MEMBER 1
We're the band Sanctified. We play metal
and punk, but with lyrics that inspire
faith in Christ.

BAND MEMBER 2
Yeah. We proved that Christian music
can be tough and hard core.

CARTMAN
Yeah, you guys are real hard core.


BAND MEMBER 1
You bet your gosh-darned rear end we
are!

STAGE HAND
All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys
are up next.

BAND MEMBER 3
Yeah! Let's do it!

BAND MEMBER 2
Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and
the Glory!

CARTMAN
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa
play with you before you go onstage.


BAND MEMBER 2
Well, that, that's cool.

BAND MEMBER 1
Always good to be praying before you're
playin'.

CARTMAN
Let's just go over here so we can hear
ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven,
we thank you for all your blessings
and we...

BUTTERS
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get
out.

MC
All right, Christians, how are you feeling
tonight?

FANS
Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!


MC
Let's keep this salvation train going
with the hot band, Sanctified!

STAGE HAND
That's Faith + 1.

MC
Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change.
Give it up for ... Faith + 1!

CARTMAN
You know, Jesus? I've been thinking
a lot about you lately and, well, that's
why I wrote this song.

I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me

[the fans sway back and forth]

I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!

You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you,
right?

What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!

Your love... is my life! You know when Im without you, there's
a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!

I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night
and it's up to you to

Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!

[Kyle's house, day. The MOOP boys are still sitting on the steps,
sulking, striking]

STAN
Dude, I didn't know being in a band
was gonna be this tough.

KYLE
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like
these that... you see what your band
is made of. We've gotta fight through
the rough times like Journey!

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, we're now entering the second
day of the rock band MOOP's refusal
to play, and the second day of absolutely
no other news to report on. In a recent
poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal
to play would stop them from downloading
music off the Internet. One percent
said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven
percent said, "Who the hell is MOOP?!"
Back to you, Tom.

LARS ULRICH
Hey, are you the guys protesting free
Internet music downloading?

STAN
Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!

LARS ULRICH
That's right. Metallica is behind you
dudes a thousand percent!

JAMES HETFIELD
We're gonna sit here and protest with
you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah!


FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike
is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians
are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette,
Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens
of others are going to join MOOP in
not playing music. This is a veritable
Strikapalooza!

[Faith Records. Doves fly across the view. The building is bathed
in bright sunlight]

CEO
Guys, we here at Faith Records were
very moved by your performance at Christfest.
You're one of the most talented Christian
rock bands we've ever heard!

CARTMAN
Thank you so much. Christ has really
blessed us with talent.

BUTTERS
Heeheeheeyeah.

EXECUTIVE 1
We just have one question, though.
We were looking over some of your lyrics,
uh... "I want to walk hand-in-hand with
Jesus on a private beach for two./I
want him to nibble on my ear and say
'I'm here for you.'" Ih it seams you
really love Christ.

CARTMAN
Yes, we sure do.

EXECUTIVE 1
Eh no but ih it appears you are actually...
in love with Christ.

CARTMAN
Well what are you saying? That, that
you don't really love Christ??

EXECUTIVE 1
Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-


CARTMAN
Well what's the difference?! You love
Christ, you're in love with Christ,
I mean, uh, what the heck is this??


EXECUTIVE 1
Uh, we'd just like to make sure the
bands we sign are in it for God, and
not for the money.

CARTMAN
I resent that, sir! I have never in
my life done anything just for the money!
If I'm lying may the Lord strike me
down right now.

BUTTERS
Uhm, oh.

EXECUTIVE 1
That's- all we needed to know. Just,
sign here and we'll get your album sold.


[Commercial. A partly-cloudy sky is shown]

ANNOUNCER
This album is not available in stores
and limited quantities are available,
so order now!

[Kyle's house, day. Various musical acts, some of them from Chef
Aid, have gathered to strike agains free music donwloads with
MOOP, including the Lord of the Underworld.]

STAN
I can't take this much longer. Maybe
we're just, not cut out to be in a band.


KYLE
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams
now! As soon as this strike ends, we're
gonna be the biggest band ever!

LARS
Yeah, if we all give in now, people
might never stop downloading our music
for free!

KYLE
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute
that people have agreed to stop.


DRIVER
Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?


KYLE
That's us!  "Dear MOOP. This letter
is to inform you that Faith Plus One's
debut album has just sold one million
copies."

STAN
What??

KYLE
"We cordially invite you to attend the
platinum album award ceremony, which
will be held tomorrow morning at ten.
Details and proof of sales enclosed.
P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."
He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.


STAN
Is this for real?? This is for real!


KYLE
He beat us. Because all this time we've
been so caught up with how to protect
our music that we forgot to just play.


LARS
But why play if we're not gonna make
millions of dollars.

KYLE
Because that's what real artists do.
People are always gonna find a way to
copy our music and swap it for free.
If we're real musicians, then we should
just play and be stoked that so many
people are listening.

STAN
Beside, maybe our sound would have
gotten downloaded for free, but if they
were good songs then people still would
have bought tickets to see our band
in concert.

KYLE
From now on, MOOP isn't about money.
MOOP is about music! We're not striking
anymore! Who's with us?!

BRITNEY
...We're just about the money.

OTHER ACTS
Yeah, yeah.

KYLE
Oh.

STAN
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about
your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna
pay 'im?

KYLE
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna
swallow my pride, face Cartman, and
say "Congratulations. You were right"
And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars.
And hopefully, he won't make a big deal
out of it.

[Platinum album award ceremony, South Park, next day. Cartman
has spent plenty of money to make this possible. He brings forth
a parade complete with elephants, clowns, jugglers, a marching
band, carnival rides, the works. Cartman stands on stage with
Token and Butters before a curtain with a large image of his
album cover printed on it]

CARTMAN
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy!
The presentation should begin shortly.


TOKEN
Cartman, what the hell is all this?


CARTMAN
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared
no expense.

TOKEN
But you spent all the money we made!


CARTMAN
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll
be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy,
black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres
and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!
Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!


KYLE
Let's just get this over with, Cartman.
You won the bet, here's ten dollars.


CARTMAN
Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold
on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have
your attention please?

A FAN
We like to praise Christ!

CARTMAN
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise
Him. I think we're ready to start now.


ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the presentation ceremony
for Faith Plus One.  And now to present
the award, here's Michael Collins.


KYLE
This is the worse day of my life.

CARTMAN
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life.


MICHAEL COLLINS
Boys, in recognition for over one million
records sold, the Christian Recording
Industry is please to present you with
this Myrrh album.

CARTMAN
Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?


STAN
I thought albums win either gold or
platinum.

MICHAEL COLLINS
Nono, in Christian rock, our albums
go gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Congratulations!

KYLE
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a
platinum album, not a myrrh album! I
don't owe you anything, fat boy!

CARTMAN
You mean to tell me I could never get
a platinum album with a Christian rock
band?!

MICHAEL COLLINS
No, but you can go double myrrh.

CARTMAN
GOD DAMNIT!!

MICHAEL COLLINS
Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name
in vain.

CARTMAN
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because
you stupid assholes don't give out platinum
albums!

MICHAEL COLLINS
But you spread the Word of the Lord.
You've brought faith in Jesus.

CARTMAN
OH, FUCK JESUS!!

BUTTERS
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't
say the F-word about-uh Jesus.

TOKEN
Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.

CARTMAN
Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could
never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again!
Fuck Jesus!

A MAN
My ears are bleeding!

TOKEN
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire
audience!

CARTMAN
Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!


STAN
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.


BUTTERS
Fuck you, Eric.

SOUTH PARK

Episode 110

"MR. HANKEY THE CHRISTMAS POO"

by

Trey Parker



INT. SMALL STAGE - DAY

All the adorable children of South Park are on risers singing
merrily.

KIDS
(Singing)
We wish you a merry Christmas, We
wish you a merry Christmas, We wish
you a merry Christmas and a happy
New Year!

The SONG ENDS and little Stan steps out in front of the group.

STAN
Lights please?

The lights dim, and a small spotlight appears on Stan.

STAN
(echoing)
And there were in the same country
shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by
night. And, lo, the angel of the
Lord came upon them, and they were
so afraid. And the angel said unto
them, fear not: for, behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy. For
born unto you this day in the city
of David is a Savior, 'tis Christ
the Lord. Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good will toward
men.
(Louder)
And now, SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY
PRESENTS -- THE BIRTH OF JESUS!

Stan gestures with his hand to another area of the stage,
where --

A curtain opens and we see that Wendy is dressed like Mary.
She is lying on her back, with her legs up in the air, moaning
horrifically.

Cartman, Kenny and some other children surround her in this
adorable little nativity.

WENDY
Oooh!! Oooh!!

Dressed as Joseph, Kyle stands between Wendys legs, waiting
for the fetus.

KYLE
Come on, Mary, PUSH!! I can see its
head!!!

WENDY
UGGHHH!!!

WENDY
AAGHAGAH!!!

Wendy pushes some more and a small, plastic blood covered
fetus pops out. Kyle holds it up by the head.

KYLE
It's a boy!!

CARTMAN
Oooh!

The kids all go 'Oooh!' Kenny is dressed like an angel.

KENNY
Mph mph mph rm!!

MR. GARRISON
WAIT A MINUTE!!!! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!

Suddenly, the lights come up and we see that we are actually
in the school gymnasium.

Mr. Garrison is in front of the stage, directing. He has a
director's megaphone and is sitting in a director's chair.

MR. GARRISON
Kyle, what the hell was that? You
need to hold the baby by the legs,
not by the head... What kind of sick
weirdo are you?

KYLE
Sorry.

MR. GARRISON
And Wendy, I'm STILL not believing
the labor pains.

WENDY
Okay.

Just then, Kyle's irate mother walks up to Garrison.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you
think you're doing?!

MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm TRYING to direct the school
Christmas play, but YOUR son was
holding baby Jesus fetus by the head.

KYLE'S MOTHER
How DARE you include the nativity in
a school play!! Don't you realize my
son is JEWISH?!?!

Kyle looks embarrassed. Mr. Garrison looks confused.

MR. GARRISON
So?

KYLE'S MOTHER
So what makes you think he should
play JOSEPH of Arimathaea?!

MR. GARRISON
Because it's Christmas.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Our family doesn't celebrate
Christmas!

Cartman and the boys all look at each other, shocked.

Kyle just lowers his head.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, God, you're not gonna lay that
Hanukkah crap on me are you?

KYLE'S MOTHER
WHAT, WHAT, WHAAATT?!?! You're not
going to get away with this, Mr.
Garrison!

The children stand off to the side listening to the argument.

CARTMAN
Oh good, Kyle's mom is here to ruin
Christmas!

KYLE
Shut up, fat boy!

CARTMAN
I'm not fat! I'm festively plump!

STAN
Why are you Jewish on Christmas,
Kyle?

Meanwhile, Garrison and Kyle's mom have finished their
bickering.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, Okay! Kyle, is there anything
you can do for the Christmas play
that isn't related to Jesus?

Kyle thinks.

KYLE'S MOTHER
How about the dreidel song, boobie?

KYLE
I can sing the Mr. Hankey song!

MR. GARRISON
The Mr. Hankey song? How does that
go?

MUSIC

KYLE
Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo!
He loves me, and I love you!

STAN
Christmas poo?!

CARTMAN
What the hell is Christmas poo?

KYLE
Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo, haven't
you guys ever heard of it?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle that is enough!

MR. GARRISON
See, that's what you get when you
raise your child to be a pagan.

KYLE'S MOTHER
NOW THAT DOES IT! I AM GOING STRAIGHT
TO THE MAYOR ABOUT YOU MR. GARRISON!!!

Kyle's mother storms out. Garrison chases after her.

MR. GARRISON
OH WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! I'm sorry. Was
it the pagan remark?!

WENDY
You guys! Look!

Wendy is standing next to the window, where big snowflakes
are falling.

WENDY
It's snowing!

The kids all rush to the door.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

The kids all run outside, where big, beautiful flakes of
snow are falling from the sky.

STAN
WOW! Christmas snow!

WENDY
Try to catch snowflakes on your
tongue, it's fun!

VINCE GUARLDI piano MUSIC kicks in as all the kids catch
snowflakes.

A flake lands on Stan's tongue.

A flake lands on Cartman's tongue.

Kenny points his head up, but just then a bird flies by and
shits in Kenny's mouth.

KENNY
PLMPH!!!

STAN
OH SICK, DUDE!!

Kyle sticks out his tongue, but --

CARTMAN
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Jewish people can't eat Christmas
snow!

KYLE
We can too!

STAN
No, I think it's against the law,
dude.

KYLE
OFFICER BARBRADY!!

Barbrady is standing in an intersection, directing traffic.

BARBRADY
What?

KYLE
IS IT ILLEGAL FOR JEWS TO EAT
CHRISTMAS SNOW?!

BARBRADY
Yes.

Kyle stares down at the ground, pouting.

KYLE
DAMMIT!

STAN
Hey, come on guys, we have to go to
the mall and tell Santa Claus what
we want for Christmas!

CARTMAN
Yeah, we'll see you later, Kyle.
Guess there's no reason for you to
come since you don't get Christmas
presents.

KYLE
No, but I get Hanukkah presents for
EIGHT DAYS!!

CARTMAN
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or
something lame like that.

Stan walks away from Kyle.

STAN
We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.

The kids all start to walk away from Kyle.

KYLE
Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do
have Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo!

The boys all stop.

STAN
What is this about Christmas poo
dude?

KYLE
Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet
every year and gives presents to
everybody who has a lot of fiber in
their diet.

CARTMAN
Oh Kyle, c'mon seriously, you are
really reaching right now.

KYLE
Well, you're gonna be sorry when you
see me riding around on Santa's sleigh
with Mr. Hankey, fat ass!

CARTMAN
(Super snooty)
You're not gonna ride on Santa's
sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, KYLE.

STAN
See ya, dude.

Everyone leaves. Kyle stands there alone... Sad. Sad, soft
music begins.

KYLE
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any
games
And I can't sing Christmas songs
Or decorate a Christmas tree
Or leave water out for Rudolph
'Cause there's something wrong with
me
My people don't believe in Jesus
Christ's Divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas...

Kyle walks over to where he sees children laughing and playing
and sitting on Santa's lap. Kyle watches from the distance,
behind a tree.

KYLE
Hanukkah is nice, but why is it that
Santa passes over my house every
year?
And instead of eating ham I have to
eat kosher latkeef.
Instead of Silent Night
I'm singing Ooo chach to ga vive and
what the fuck is up with lighting
all these fucking candles tell me
please!
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry, but I'm Hebrew
On Christmas.

The song ends. Kyle slowly walks away.

EXT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

It appears that the whole town has come to protest.

Everybody is AD LIBBING complaints and shouts.

The Mayor tries to quiet everybody down as she walks up to a
podium on the steps.

MAYOR
Okay, everybody, settle down!

A random WOMAN steps up, followed by a few townmembers.

WOMAN
Mayor, we are deeply offended by the
nativity scene in front of the capital
office! Church and State are
SEPARATE!!

Her followers cheer. The town erupts again into complaints.

Kyle walks up to where the other boys are.

KYLE
What's going on you guys?

STAN
The whole town is pissed off at each
other. It's really sweet.

KYLE'S MOTHER
That isn't all Mayor! The school
play is doing a nativity scene! It
isn't being sensitive to the Jewish
community!

MR. GARRISON
You ARE the Jewish community!

The townspeople all AD LIB shouts and complaints again.

CARTMAN
Oh boy, super bitch is at it again.

KYLE
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

The town Priest steps up to the front of the crowd.

PRIEST
Mayor, the nativity is what Christmas
is all about! If you remove Christ,
you must remove Santa and Frosty and
all that garbage too!!

The Christians all cheer, some 'Boos'. The Mayor rolls her
eyes.

OLDER MAN
And we must put a STOP to the cutting
down of Christmas trees!!

JIMBO
And I'm sick and tired of those little
flaps on coffee lids! If you don't
want to spill your coffee then you
shouldn't be driving with it!!

Silence... The townspeople all look around...

Finally, they all cheer again, in spite of themselves.

MAYOR
(Quieting them again)
Okay, people... Clearly we need to
reach a compromise... Perhaps we
need a new icon for Christmas.

The mayor makes a specific 'all encompassing' gesture with
her hands (see Trey).

ASSISTANT #2
Ooh! Brilliant idea Mayor!

The townspeople think.

The townspeople all AD LIB agreement.

KYLE
(Shouting out)
Hey, how about Mr. Hankey The
Christmas Poo?

Everybody turns and looks at Kyle.

Cartman and Stan roll their eyes.

MAYOR
Excuse me?

STAN
Oh boy, here we go again.

Kyle's Mother and Father look scared.

KYLE
Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet
every year and gives presents to
everybody who has a lot of fiber in
their diet.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, shush!

KYLE
It's true! He doesn't care what faith
you are!
(Singing)
Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo!
He loves me!
And I love you!
Therefore, vicariously, he loves
you!
Even if you're...

CARTMAN
Don't mind him, he's a very disturbed
little boy.

KENNY
Mph rmph rm!

STAN
(Laughing)
Yeah!

Kyle's mother rushes over and grabs Kyle by the arm.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Okay, Kyle, we're leaving RIGHT NOW!

KYLE
Wait!

Kyle's mom hurries him off.

MAYOR
Anyway... I'll put together a crack
team of my best workers to make sure
this will be the most non-offensive
Christmas ever to any religious or
minority group of any kind. Are there
any other suggestions?

Mr. Garrison raises his hand.

MAYOR
Yes, Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
Could we get rid of all the Mexicans?

MAYOR
No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid
of all the Mexicans.

MR. GARRISON
Rats.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #1

INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kyle's house is GARISHLY decorated with Hanukkah crap. A
menorah has six candles lit.

Ike is entertaining himself with a dreidel.

KYLE'S FATHER
It is SICK and disgusting and we
simply will NOT HAVE IT!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Your father's right, Kyle.

Kyle just looks down at the floor.

KYLE'S FATHER
Sheila, let me handle this. Having
imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but
this simply will NOT DO!!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Listen to your father, Kyle.

Ike goes chasing after his dreidel and crashes head first
into the Menorah.

KYLE'S FATHER
Now, I want you repeat after me.
'There is no such thing as Mr.
Hankey'.

KYLE
But dad! He always --

KYLE'S FATHER
SAY IT!

Kyle sighs deeply.

KYLE
(defeated)
There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

KYLE'S FATHER
Again.

KYLE
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.

KYLE'S MOTHER
This is for your own good, boobie.

KYLE'S FATHER
Now you go brush your teeth, and
march in to bed! You won't be opening
your Hanukkah present tonight.

Kyle hangs his head low and slinks into the bathroom.

KYLE
(Under his breath)
Probably just another stupid dreidel
anyway...

KYLE'S FATHER
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

KYLE
I said Ike's on fire.

As Kyle leaves, his mother and father turn around and see
that Ike, sure enough, has caught on fire. They run over to
him and cover him with a blanket.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh my God!

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kyle stands on a little stool, brushing his teeth in the
mirror.

KYLE
It isn't fair! I don't want to be an
outcast!

After a few seconds, Kyle hears a small noise coming from
the toilet... drip... drip...

Kyle looks down at the toilet, then quickly looks away and
goes back to brushing his teeth.

MR. HANKEY
Hellllooo!

KYLE
I'm not hearing that.

MR. HANKEY
Hellllooo!

Drip... Drip...

Now Kyle walks over to the toilet and peers in.

KYLE
Mr. Hankey?

Just then, from the depths of the toilet bowl, comes
laughable, lovable MR. HANKEY, a jolly old piece of poo with
a red and white Christmas hat.

MR. HANKEY
HOWDY HO!!!!

Hankey flies up into the air, bounces off a wall, and lands
on the counter.

MR. HANKEY
Howdy Ho, Kyle! Gosh you're lookin'
swell.

KYLE
Go away, Mr. Hankey.

MR. HANKEY
You know something, pal? You smell
an awful lot like flowers.

KYLE
I said go away. My dad says you aren't
real.

MR. HANKEY
Not real? Well shucks, if I weren't
real, could I sing this jolly
Christmas song?

Music kicks in. Mr. Hankey throws his arms up.

MR. HANKEY
(Singing)
Santa Claus is on his way
He loaded goodies on his sleigh
He'll drop 'em off on Christmas Day
And I'll say HOWDY HO!!

As Hankey sings, he does a little dance. Leaping all around
the bathroom, and leaving a small trail of brown wherever he
goes.

KYLE
Mr. Hankey! SHHH! I'll get in trouble!

MR. HANKEY
(Singing)
Folks'll gather round the fire
Sing a song form a choir
Pretty soon they'll all retire
And I'll say HOWDY HO!!

As the song continues, Hankey jumps up to the mirror and
writes 'Noel' in brown on it.

POUNDING at the door.

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle? What are you doing in there?

KYLE
NOTHING!

KYLE'S FATHER
Open this door!

MR. HANKEY
I hope that Santa comes real soon
been waiting since the first of June --

KYLE
Mr. Hankey come here!

Kyle grabs Mr. Hankey --

But suddenly, the door bursts open. We see only the expression
on Kyle's Father's face. He is almost in shock.

Now we see what dad sees. The entire bathroom, the walls the
floors the mirrors, are smeared with poo.

Slowly, the camera pans to Kyle who is just standing there
with a lifeless, plain lump of poo in his hand.

KYLE'S FATHER
KYLEEEEE!!!

Kyle looks at the piece of poo in his hand.

KYLE
Say something Mr. Hankey!

The poo is motionless.

INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kyle's father stands at the door. Kyle is in bed. Dad flicks
the light off.

KYLE'S FATHER
NOW YOU GET TO SLEEP AND THINK ABOUT
HOW YOUR POOR MOTHER HAS TO CLEAN
THAT BATHROOM UP!!

KYLE'S MOTHER
(very distant)
Wh... Wha... WHAT Me?!

Kyle's father slams the door shut.

Kyle is left alone in the darkness.

MR. HANKEY
HOWDY HO!!

Mr. Hankey jumps down on the bed next to Kyle.

KYLE
Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you
go?!

MR. HANKEY
You should be wearing socks to sleep,
Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold.

KYLE
NOBODY believes in you! Not even my
friends!

MR. HANKEY
Ooh, gee that's too bad...

KYLE
Hey, how about you come to school
with me tomorrow, so I can at least
prove I'm not crazy to my friends?

MR. HANKEY
Say, that sounds like a swell idea!
We can show everyone the true spirit
of Christmas!

KYLE
Yeah! We'll show them!

Mr. Hankey tucks himself in next to Kyle, and the two fall
asleep.

EXT. SOUTH PARK - MORNING

Establishing shot of morning on festively decorated South
Park avenue.

MAYOR
Okay people we've got to turn this
place around! Take down anything
that is offensive to any specific
group!

The townspeople start taking decorations off the front of
the buildings.

Jimbo is on a ladder in front of his store's doorway.

JIMBO
Is mistletoe offensive?

MAYOR
(Calling out)
Is anyone offended by mistletoe?

One guy in the corner raises his hand.

MAYOR
Lose the mistletoe!

EXT. BUSSTOP - MORNING

Cartman, Stan and Kenny are waiting at the busstop.

STAN
You guys!! I'm getting that John
Elway football helmet for Christmas!

CARTMAN
How do you know?

STAN
'Cause I looked in my parents closet
last night!

CARTMAN
Yeah, well I sneaked around my mom's
closet too and saw what I'm getting:
The 'UltraVibe Pleasure 2000'.

STAN
What's that?

CARTMAN
I don't know, but it sounds pretty
sweet.

Kyle walks up, carrying a little shoebox.

KYLE
Hello, everybody!

STAN
What's in the box, Dude?

KYLE
It's a surprise!

CARTMAN
Lemme see!

KYLE
Oh, okay, but don't scare him...

Stan slowly opens the lid and peers into the box. Cartman
and Kenny look in as well.

Silence...

Silence...

Kyle is the only one smiling, the other boys look deeply
disturbed.

STAN
Dude! SICK!!!

Kyle looks in the box, again Mr. Hankey is just a lump of
shit. No eyes, no hat, no gloves...

CARTMAN
Is this some kind of Jewish
tradition?!

KENNY
Mph rmph rm rmph!

KYLE
Wait you guys! He's alive!

STAN
Kyle... I think you better get home
and get some sleep.

KYLE
(To the box)
COME ON, DANCE!! DANCE!!!

Cartman, Stan and Kenny look at each other with deep concern.

KYLE
DANCE DAMN YOU!!

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

The second Mayor's assistant is in a white lab coat, and
standing at the front of a group of people, holding a
clipboard. (Is that a shitty sentence or what?)

ASSISTANT #2
Now, this is very simple. I'm going
to say words, and the computer will
measure how offended you are by them.
In this way, we can find out which
words are least offensive for use in
the holiday season... Are we ready?

The townspeople just sit there, connected to wires and
computers.

MAN
Here we go... Christ.

A few beeps go off.

MAN
Okay... CHAIR.

No computer sound.

MAN
CAMEL.

A few little beeps go off.

MAN
SAND.

Silence.

MAN
STUPID WHOP DEGO.

BEEEP BEEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!

MAN
BENCH...

EXT. SOUTH PARK - ELEMENTARY

Establishing.

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

The nativity stuff has been taken down. A small crew is in
the process of taken down all the pictures of Santa Claus as
well.

Two big guys start to drag the Christmas tree out.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, do you have to take the Christmas
tree too?

BURLY GUY
Mayor's orders.

The children all watch with sad eyes as their cute little
set is dismantled.

MR. GARRISON
Okay children, I'm really having a
hard time with our Christmas play.

The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with
Jesus OR Santa Claus...

CARTMAN
Thanks to Kyle's mother.

KYLE
Shut up, Cartman!

MR. GARRISON
So does anybody know any non-Santa
or non-Jesus Christmas songs?

Cartman raises his hand.

MR. GARRISON
Yes, Eric?

CARTMAN
How about we sing 'Kyle's Mom is a
Stupid Bitch in D minor'.

KYLE
I told you NOT to call my mom a bitch,
CARTMAN!!

CARTMAN
Oh!

MUSIC kicks in.

CARTMAN
Wellllllll....
(Singing)
Kyle's mom's a bitch!
She a big fat bitch!
She's the biggest bitch
In the whole wide world!
She's a stupid bitch if there ever
was a bitch
She's a bitch to all the boys and
girls.

KYLE
Shut up, Cartman!

As Cartman continues, Mr. Hankey hops out in front of Kyle.
Nobody notices except for Kyle.

MR. HANKEY
Howdy ho!

KYLE
(Softly)
Mr. Hankey!

CARTMAN
Monday she's a bitch!
On Tuesday she's a bitch!
And Wednesday through Saturday
She's a bitch!
And then on Sunday just to be
different
She's a super King Kamayamaya BITCH!

MR. HANKEY
Golly, that isn't very nice! I'd
sure like to teach him a lesson!

Kyle reaches for Hankey, but Hankey slips through his hands,
leaps off the desk and hurls himself at Cartman.

CARTMAN
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's
mom
She's the biggest bitch in the whole
wide world
She's a mean ol' bitch and she has
stupid hair, she's a bi... bi...
bi... bi bitch...
She's a stupid bitch.
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's a
just a dirty bitch.
Kyle's mom is a BITCH!

The singing and music stops.

KYLE
Mr. Hankey, NO!

MR. HANKEY
Aah!

MR. GARRISON
What the...

Garrison looks down at the little lifeless lump of poo on
the floor.

CARTMAN
GROSS, KYLE!!

MR. GARRISON
OH MY LORD!! KYLE, DID YOU JUST THROW
DOO-DOO AT ERIC?!?!

Kyle is just sitting there, wide eyed, with a big brown stain
on his hand.

KYLE
Uhh...

The whole class erupts into AD LIB 'GROSS!'s and 'SICK's.

CARTMAN
YOU SICK BASTARD!

Kyle slinks in his desk as the children all point and laugh
at him.

INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Kyle is sitting in the counselor's office, facing the odd,
wiry counselor.

COUNSELOR
Now, Kyle as your school counselor,
I want to try and help you confront
your problem, okay.

KYLE
I don't have a problem!

COUNSELOR
Well it's MY understanding that you...
(checking his notes)
...You have an acute case of
fecalphelia.

KYLE
What's that?

COUNSELOR
Well, a fecalpheliac is somebody who
is obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.

KYLE
Mookie-stinks?

COUNSELOR
Now, I also understand that you're
Jewish, is that right Kyle?

KYLE
Well, not on purpose!

COUNSELOR
So, this must be a pretty hard time
of year for you... Being Christmas
and all. Do the other kids make fun
of you?

KYLE
Well, sometimes.

COUNSELOR
And that must make you mad.

KYLE
Well, sure.

COUNSELOR
Mad enough to KILL, Kyle?

DRAMATIC MUSIC SWELLS UP QUICKLY.

KYLE
No, dude!

THE MUSIC ENDS.

COUNSELOR
Oh, that's good.

Kyle looks confused.

COUNSELOR
You see Kyle, sometimes we feel like
an outsider, we create friends, okay?
in our minds, okay?

KYLE
But Mr. Hankey seems so real.

COUNSELOR
Well, of course he does. In your
screwed up little head he's the only
friend you have.

The counselor takes a sip of his coffee. When he sets the
mug back down, Kyle notices that Mr. Hankey is in the mug,
wearing a shower cap and brushing his back with a scrub brush.
He is whistling merrily, then he waves at Kyle.

MR. HANKEY
Kyle, Howdy Ho!

Kyle's eyes widen hugely.

COUNSELOR
Right now you're nuttier than Chinese
Chicken Salad, okay?

Kyle nervously looks back to the counselor.

COUNSELOR
I mean, you're one screwed up little
kid, do you understand?

The counselor takes another sip of coffee. Kyle cringes.

MR. HANKEY
Santa's loaded up his sleigh Soon
he'll be on his merry way...

COUNSELOR
So just try to stay positive, stay
away from drugs and alcohol, and in
the meantime, I'm going to put you
on a heavy regimen of Prozac.

Finally, the counselor looks down at his mug.

COUNSELOR
WAGAHAGHAGHA!!!! OH MY GOD YOU SICK
LITTLE MONKEY!!

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, we've just received
word from the Mayor that the Christmas
play can't include any Christmas
lights, since they offend people
with epilepsy.

The children all moan.

MR. GARRISON
So, Kenny, would you please go over
and pull the light cords out of the
wall?

Kenny looks a little scared, but walks over to where the
HUGE mass of Christmas light wires are plugged into the wall.

MR. GARRISON
Careful now Kenny, those are very
very dangerous.

The children all watch on as Kenny grabs the cords and pulls
them out. There is a SPARK!!

But Kenny just stands there, unharmed. He sighs with relief
and walks back to the group.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, now let's practice our --

COUNSELOR
No! Get away from me!!!

The counselor runs in, followed by innocent little Kyle.

KYLE
Here, just look more closely at it!

COUNSELOR
NO!! GO AWAY!! Stan, you need to do
something about your friend, okay?
Get him outta here before he hurts
anybody, okay?

EXT. SOUTH PARK MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY

The same institution that Garrison was in episode 2.

INT. SOUTH PARK MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY

The boys walk Kyle into the front office, which is decorated
with Christmas things. He walks up to a plain looking nurse.

STAN
Hello, we need to commit our friend
Kyle, please.

NURSE
Reason?

KYLE
I'm a clinically depressed
fecalpheliac on prosaic.

NURSE
Any allergies?

KYLE
No.

NURSE
JACKET!!!

Suddenly, two burly men in white burst out, slap a straight-
jacket on Kyle and drag him away.

CARTMAN
Bye, Kyle! Happy Hanukkah!

Establishing.

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The kids are all dressed in festive costumes, darting around
and getting ready for their big night.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, does everyone have
their leotards on?

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

It appears the entire town has turned out for the Christmas
Play. The townspeople all fill the bleachers in anticipation.

MAN
Good, it looks like they've taken
the Christmas trees down.

WOMAN
Yes, and there's nothing Christian
either. This should be great.

KYLE'S MOTHER
(Sniffling)
Oh, this could be such a wonderful
Christmas play. I wish our little
Kyle was here to see it.

INT. PADDED CELL - NIGHT

Kyle is in an all white padded cell wearing his all white
straight jacket.

KYLE
(Singing)
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
With dreidel I will play.
Second verse, same as the first!
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel...

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The townspeople sit in the bleachers.

ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the South Park Elementary
Holiday.....

TOWNSPERSON
Wait wait!! There's a star above the
stage! That's very offensive to non-
Christians!

JIMBO
Oh, come on!

TOWNSPERSON
HEY! Don't push your beliefs on ME
buddy!!

STAN'S FATHER
I agree!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, brother... Kenny would you please
climb that ladder and take down the
star above the stage?

Kenny nervously looks over to a rickety old ladder.

Like a trooper, Kenny walks over and takes the first few
steps.

MR. GARRISON
And be careful not to fall in that
little pool below you Kenny, the
shark for the third act is in there.

Kenny looks down and sees that there is indeed a huge
maneating shark in the pool below him.

KENNY
Mmph!

Kenny climbs the ladder quickly.

The lights dim.

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
South Park Elementary Holiday
EXPERIENCE!! Before we bring out the
kiddies for the play here's a
nonoffensive, non-denominational
Holiday song by the school Chef!

The townspeople applaud. Chef takes the stage as MUSIC begins.

CHEF
I'm gonna lay you down by the yule
log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silent your night...

Kenny shakes a bit at the top of the ladder. He looks down
and sees the ominous shark below him.

CHEF
You'll hear the herald angels sing
when I'm sliding off your bra.
I Just can't wait to jingle your
bells and
Fa La La your La!
Baby it's Christmas!!

STAN
I wish Kyle was here, it just doesn't
seem right without him.

CARTMAN
Well, old Kyle is going to be locked
up for a while, so get used to it.

MR. GARRISON
Okay kids, get ready to take your
places.

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

NARRATOR
Thank you Chef. And now South Park
Elementary presents the happy non-
offensive non-denominational Christmas
play! With music and lyrics by New
York minimalist composer Phillip
Glass!

Phillip glass stands at his keyboard and waves.

Stan, Cartman, Kenny and all the other kids take the stage
in their drab, brown outfits.

The extremely lame and gay Phillip Glass music starts.

The boys and girls all start to sing.

PHILLIP GLASS
AS I TURN AND LOOK INTO THE SUN, THE
RAYS BURN MY EYES HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

The parents all look confused.

PHILLIP GLASS
HOW LIKE A TURTLE THE SUN LOOKS...

KYLE'S MOTHER
What the hell is this? This is
horrible!

PRIEST
This is the most god-awful piece of
crap I've ever seen!

Philip Glass looks around, worried.

MR. GARRISON
Hey! YOU'RE the ones who made it
this way!!

PRIEST
Yeah! It's because the Jews said it
couldn't be Christian!

KYLE'S FATHER
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa
Claus!!

ENVIRONMENTALIST
ALL YOU BASTARDS RUINED CHRISTMAS.

The townspeople all lash out at each other. In a fury, they
charge and start beating the crap out of one another.

KYLE'S FATHER
Get him in the ribs.

ENVIRONMENTALIST
Damn tree hugger!

The children just look on helplessly as their parents fight
like dogs.

STAN
This sucks, dude. This is like the
worst Christmas I've ever seen!

WENDY
Yeah.

CHEF
Say, where's Kyle?

STAN
We committed him.

CHEF
What? Why?

STAN
'Cause he kept seeing this little
brown piece of Christmas poo
everywhere that he went.

CHEF
Christmas Poo? You mean Mr. Hankey?

The boys all freeze.

STAN
Huh? Uh-Oh!

COMMERCIAL BREAK

THE COMMERCIAL

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

A wholesome, pretty mother walks into the dining room, where
her two kids, a ten year old BOY and an eight year old GIRL
are looking bored at the table.

MOTHER
Say kids, why the long faces?

BOY
We're bored.

GIRL
There's nothin' to do.

MOTHER
Well, maybe this will help!

The mother pulls a box out from nowhere. It is a very colorful
box with Mr. Hankey on the front.

BOY
WOW! MR. HANKEY CONSTRUCTION SET!!!

GIRL
COOL!!!

Happy MUSIC kicks in.

ANNOUNCER
That's right, kids, now you can make
your very own Mr. Hankey!

The girl dumps the box out onto the table.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

The kids and mom are kneeled down by the toilet bowl.

ANNOUNCER
Just use this special fecal fishing
net, and select your best Mr. Hankey.

GIRL
That one!

The mom dips the little fishing net into the toilet.

ANNOUNCER
Then use the hand-crafted Hankey-
stand to add whatever eyes, mouths
and hats you want!

The little girl puts the finishing touches on a little Mr.
Hankey, perched on a wooden platform.

BOY
I made a mariachi Mr. Hankey.

GIRL
Now it's a Mrs. Hankey.

BOY
Let's put the fez hat on him.

GIRL
I wish daddy was still alive.

The mother smiles.

ANNOUNCER
The Mr. Hankey construction set comes
with everything seen here.

MOTHER
Hey, where's Mr. Hankey?

The baby claps its hands and laughs, covered in brown
(chocolate, of course).

MOTHER
I love you sweetheart.

GIRL
I love you too.

The mother laughs merrily with her children.

FADE OUT:

ACT III

EXT. SOUTH PARK - ELEMENTARY

ESTABLISHING

STAN
This is horrible. Everybody's fighting
and my best friend is in an
institution... All because we didn't
believe in Mr. Hankey.

CHEF
Well, you can believe in him now.

Two parents go hurling through frame, beating the shit out
of each other.

STAN
I believe!

Stan looks at Cartman.

WENDY
I believe in Mr. Hankey!

MR. HANKEY
HOWDY HO!!!

The boys all turn to see Mr. Hankey! Who has flipped out of
his shoebox and is magically floating in the air.

MR. HANKEY
HOWDY FOLKS! Gosh you sure do smell
nice and flowery!

STAN AND CARTMAN
Whoa!!!

MR. HANKEY
Howdy Ho, Chef!

CHEF
Howdy Ho, Mr. Hankey.

CARTMAN
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys,
I'm going home. Talking poo is where
I draw the line.

MR. HANKEY
What's all the ruckus?

CHEF
I'm glad your here Mr. Hankey, the
whole town is about to kill each
other.

Stan and Cartman watch this exchange with open mouths and
wide eyes.

MR. HANKEY
I reckon this could be a job for Mr.
Hankey!

INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The townspeople are all still beating the shit out of each
other, when suddenly, they hear a loud whistle.

MR. HANKEY
STOP FIGHTING!!!

Everybody turns and sees little Mr. Hankey standing on the
edge of the stage.

MAYOR
Oh my God, what the hell is that
thing?

MR. HANKEY
Come on, gang, don't fight!

The townspeople look at each other.

MR. HANKEY
You people have focused so hard on
the things wrong with Christmas,
that you've forgotten what's so right
about it! Don't you see? This is the
one time of year we're supposed to
forget all the bad stuff. Stop being
sad about the state of world... And
for just one day, say 'Oh to heck
with it! Let's sing and dance and
bake cookies!'

The townspeople just sit there. In shock.

Silence...

Finally, the sound of one person clapping echoes in the
distance. Everyone turns to see Kyle's father, clapping
softly, but slowly getting louder and faster.

Kyle's Father claps even harder and then a few people join
in... Then more people join in.

Finally the whole auditorium erupts into glorious applause.
They stand and cheer.

Mr. Hankey smiles.

STAN
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right
here.

INT. SOUTH PARK MENTAL INSTITUTION - DAY

Kyle is sitting in his padded cell all alone. A very sad
Christmas.

KYLE
(Softly)
I'm a Jew A lonely Jew
But... what's that?

JINGLE BELLS are heard in the distance. Kyle picks his head
up and looks around.

A little figure drops onto the windowsill.

MR. HANKEY
HOWDY HO, KYLE!!!

Kyle rolls his eyes.

KYLE
Oh, no! I'm not sane yet.

MR. HANKEY
I brought some friends with me!

KYLE
Friends?

Suddenly, the whole place illuminates with colorful lights
and festive voices.

Kyle looks down out of his window and sees that the ENTIRE
TOWN has come and gathered in front of the mental institution.
Kyle can't believe his eyes -- EVERYBODY is there with
candles, trees, lights and joy.

EVERYBODY
MERRY CHRISTMAS KYLE BROFLOVSKI!!

KYLE
You mean you can see him?! I'M NOT
CRAZY?!

Kyle runs outside and joins the group, just as they all join
hands and start to sing.

ALL
(Singing)
Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo!
He loves me!
I love you!
Therefore, vicariously, he loves
you!
Even if you're a Jew!

Mr. Hankey bounces over and gives Kyle a big kiss. Kyle
laughs, in spite of himself.

SINGER
Sometimes he's nutty!
Sometimes he's corny!
He can be brown or greenish brown!
But if you eat fiber Christmas Eve
He Might come to your town!

Mr. Hankey stands on top of a roof and starts tossing out
presents to all the townspeople.

ALL
MR. HANKEY THE CHRISTMAS POO, HE
LOVES ME, I LOVE YOU.....

Mr. Hankey jumps back down on the ground, and then starts
hopping away.

MR. HANKEY
Well, I've got a LONG night ahead of
me!! BYE, BYE! AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!

CARTMAN
Goodbye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of
presents! I always believed in you!!!

SANTA
HOWDY HO, HO, HO...

Mr. Hankey crosses a full moon and disappears.

STAN
You know, I learned something today.
I learned that Jewish people are OK,
and that Hanukkah can be cool too.

The boys just stand there.

KYLE
Yeah, you know... It seems like
something's still not right...

Kyle looks around and focuses on Kenny, who is just standing
there, looking fine.

CARTMAN
Yeah... Something feels unfinished.

The boys look at Kenny. Kenny starts to look a little nervous.

STAN
Well, what could it be?

The boys stare at Kenny as a TITLE FADES UP

Trey Parker





[At the bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny wait. Ike
hops into view]

THE BOYS
School days, school days, teacher's
golden rule day...

KYLE
Ah, damn it!

CARTMAN
What?

KYLE
My God-damned little brother's trying
to follow me to school, again!

IKE
Suck my balls.

KYLE
No, Ike! You can't come to school with
me.

CARTMAN
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!

KYLE
Dude, for the last time, don't call
my brother a dildo!

CARTMAN
Alright, go home, you little semen-puking
asshole dickhead!  Ow!

STAN
Dude, sweet!

KYLE
Yeah. Check it out.  Ready Ike? Kick
the baby!

IKE
Don't hit the God-damned baby!

KYLE
Kick it!

IKE
Waa...  ...aaaah.

CARTMAN
Uuugh.

KYLE
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't
get much sleep last night.

CARTMAN
That's because I was having these bogus
nightmares all night long.

KYLE
Really? What about?

CARTMAN
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my
bed...  in the dark. When all of a sudden
this bright blue light filled the room
. Then slowly my bedroom door begin
to open  and the next thing I remember
I was being drug through a hallway.
Then these scary hands wanted to operate
on me.  And they had big heads and big
black eyes...

STAN
Dude! Visitors!

KYLE
Totally!

CARTMAN
What?

STAN
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were
visitors!

CARTMAN
No, it was just a dream,  my mom said
so.

STAN
Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute.
This has all happened before.

KYLE
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.


CARTMAN
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin'
about?

KYLE
Cartman, don't you remember the last
time you had this dream?

CARTMAN
Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just
tryin' to scare me.

STAN
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens
put some device in you and then we tied
you up to a tree and you went up on
their ship! You don't remember that?


CARTMAN
No I don't remember that!

KYLE
You don't?

CARTMAN
No, because the aliens erased my memory!


STAN
I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried
to follow you to school. You kicked
him, then Cartman told us about his
alien dream.

KYLE
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his
car.

CHEF
Hello there, children!

KYLE
And then you said

STAN
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?


CHEF
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with
hot buttered noodles

ALL
and a choice of green bean salad or
vegetable medley.

KYLE
Weird

CHEF
Say, did any of you children

ALL
see the alien space ship last night?


CHEF
What the?

STAN
Chef, we're in a repeat.

CHEF
A repeat??

KYLE
Cartman was visited by aliens again
last night. And now it's like we're
living a repeat of a previous day.


CARTMAN
Aw dude, I hate repeats!

CHEF
I've been feelin' déjà vu all mornin',
children. I knew somethin' strange was
goin' on!

STAN
It all started when Cartman got an anal
probe.

CHEF
We have to get Eric to a proctologist
right away.

[South Park Medical Clinic. Inside, Chef and the boys wait on
chairs as Cartman lies face down on a proctologist's table]


KYLE
What is a proc-tologist, Chef?

CHEF
He's a doctor that specializes in your
asshole, children.

STAN
You mean, at some point in this doctor's
life he decided he wanted to work on
people's buttholes.

CHEF
That's right.

KYLE
What a dick!

PROCTOLOGIST
Hello everyone!

CHEF
Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric
on such short notice.

PROCTOLOGIST
What seems to be the problem?

CHEF
We just want you to take a look and
tell us if you see anything abnormal.


KYLE
Other than his monstrous size.

CARTMAN
SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED
MOUTH!

PROCTOLOGIST
All right, let's see here.  Oh my God!!


CARTMAN
What?

PROCTOLOGIST
Why, there's a huge crack goin' right
down the middle!

CARTMAN
Haha, very funny.

STAN
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one
a zillion times.

PROCTOLOGIST
All right, let's take a look.

CARTMAN
Heey, just what the hell do you think
you're doing?

CHEF
Eric, the doctor has to feel inside
your rectum.

KYLE
And afterwards, he'll probably have
to burn his hand and bury it.

CARTMAN
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's
hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across
the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh.
Oohh. Eow.

PROCTOLOGIST
Well the prostate seems to be normal.
No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...


CARTMAN
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.


PROCTOLOGIST
Wait, what's this?

KYLE
Are you okay?

CARTMAN
Dude. You know that feeling when you
take a huuuge dump? Awesome!

CHEF
Well, doctor?

PROCTOLOGIST
I've never quite seen this before,
uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid
cream.

CARTMAN
Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!

STAN
You all right?

CARTMAN
You know the feeling when the huge dump
you just took shoots back up inside
your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!

PROCTOLOGIST
I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this
way.

CHEF
That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an
alien hoobajoob! Come on, children!
We've got to get Eric to some real help!


STAN
Where to now, Chef?

CHEF
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked
like some kinda alien satellite dish.
We need to see my friend down at the
Space Center now!

[The space center. Lots of satellite dishes dot the premises.
Inside Chef leads the children to a scientist.]

CHEF
And you're the only person I could think
of who might be able to help us, Jeff.


JEFF
How do we uh, make it come out?

CHEF
Someone just has to activate it like
the proctologist did.

CARTMAN
Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting
their finger in my ass again! Unless
it's Kyle.

STAN
What?

KYLE
No way!  You do it, Kenny!

CARTMAN
Nope! It has to be Kyle!

STAN
Go on.

KYLE
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's
butt!

CHEF
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at
stake.

CARTMAN
Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it
won't bite.

KYLE
God-damnit Cartman!

CARTMAN
I couldn't resist. I'm sorry.

KYLE
Stop it Cartman!

CARTMAN
Okay. Okay okay.

KENNY
(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)

KYLE
God Damnit!

CARTMAN
Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay,
go ahead. I'm all out of farts now.
Gahaaa! Derrr!

KENNY
(Derrr!)

CARTMAN
Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore.
Oh yes it is!

KENNY
(Yes it is!)

CHEF
Eric, that's enough!

CARTMAN
Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!

KYLE
That's it!  I don't care about the fate
of the world! Screw it!

STAN
Oh, nice going, Cartman!

CARTMAN
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go
ahead, Kyle.

KYLE
No!

CARTMAN
No, go ahead. I'm dry.

KYLE
You're lying!

CHEF
It stopped being funny forty seconds
ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!


CARTMAN
But it was one of the best times I've
ever had.

JEFF
Can I see this thing, please?

CARTMAN
Okay.  Ohhh! God-damnit!

CHEF
Okay. Now it's funny again.

CARTMAN
This is so awesome. I don't think I
made it out of that proctologist's office,
guys. I think I died and went to heaven.


KYLE
That does it! CHARGE!

CHEF
What's it doing?

JEFF
It, it's sending a transmission of some
kind.  Got it!

KYLE
It's just sending images of cities and
people and stuff.

CHEF
Where is the signal being sent to?


CARTMAN
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you
guys.

KYLE
We went through all that just for some
gay video of Earth?

STAN
We wanted to see an alien planet or
something.

JEFF
Whoever they are, if they're receiving
messages, they might be sending them,
too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.


KYLE
Candy bars?

JEFF
Yu-you know. Candy bars. They usually
come in a wrapper. Just like you...
wrap a Christmas present. Christmas
happens when it's cold. Cold, as in
Alaska - that's... with polar bears.
Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can
switch the polarity to see what transmissions
are coming from the location this one
is being sent to!  What the heck?  They're
coming in!

STAN
What do we do???

CARTMAN
It's that guy you want! He's trying
to reverse your polarities!

JEFF
What??

CHEF
Help!

KYLE
Aaaah! Runrunruuun!

STAN
Let's go!

CHEF
Get in the car, children! Get in the
car!

STAN
What is that?

CHEF
Can you see anything, children?

KYLE
The aliens are chasing us!

CHEF
God damned aliens!

STAN
Chef! End of the road!

CHEF
Hold on, children!  We have to ditch
them!

CARTMAN
What are you doing, man?!

NARRATOR
Looks like them boys are gettin' a
little fresh air.

KYLE
I think we ditched them.

CHEF
I don't think we're outta the woods
yet.

DRIVER
Doot doot.

STAN
It's the police!

CHEF
That ain't no police!

CARTMAN
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.


STAN
Chef!!

CHEF
HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you!
Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?!
Chinese auto school?!

THE BOYS
Chef! Chef! They've got us!

CHEF
You're lucky I didn't just turn around
and beat your white skinny alien asses
anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember
to...  Huh?  Aw crap! Children!

THE BOYS
Cheeeeeeef!

NARRATOR
Well, it looks like the boys are in
more trouble than a June bug in molasses.
And it's pretty thick molasses, too.


[A chamber. Stan is tied up in some green alien pod, asleep.]


STAN
Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up!

KYLE
What the? Where are, where are we?


STAN
We're in the alien ship.

CARTMAN
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's
ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!

KYLE
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien
space ship.

CARTMAN
...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank
you Lord.

STAN
Guys. Look.

KYLE, CARTMAN
Wow.

STAN
My God, do you guys realize? This is
only the second time we've ever been
in outer space.

KYLE
Yeah.

KENNY
(Awesome)

CARTMAN
This is like my fifth time.

STAN
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.


KENNY
(Oh no!)

ALIEN
Hello boys.

STAN
Dad?

ALIEN
No, not really. I just read your mind
and thought this form might be more
pleasing to you.

KYLE
Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.


STAN
Yeah, that's like that stupid movie,
Contact.

CARTMAN
Aw God, that movie pissed me off.

ALIEN
Very well, I shall show my true form.
Rah rah rah rah rah. Rah rah rah rah.


THE BOYS
AAAAH!

STAN
Okay okay, take the form of something
else!

ALIEN
How's this?

CARTMAN
Santa!

STAN
Nno, that's stupid too.

ALIEN
How about this?

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
No.  No!

CARTMAN
Oooo, very nice.

STAN
No!

KYLE
No!

ALIEN
Dy-no-mite!

THE BOYS
No!

[Back at the space center, day. Jeff is cleaning up after the
destruction left behind by the visitors]

CHEF
Jeff!! The aliens took the children
up on their ship.

JEFF
Oh no!

CHEF
Did you find out what the aliens were
up to?

JEFF
When I reversed the polarities, I found
this:  It's a message that the aliens
are broadcasting throughout the entire
universe. But I have no idea what it
says.

CHEF
They took the children, Jeff! I have
to know what those aliens are up to!


JEFF
Wait a minute! Butt sex!

CHEF
Butt sex?

JEFF
Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication,
right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh...
Chupacabra 's the, the goat killer of
Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories
from the past that are often fictionalized.
Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama
students! Students at colleges usally
have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's
binary code!

CHEF
Who's havin' butt sex?

[Back on the alien ship]

ALIEN
Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello
my ragtime gal!

THE BOYS
No!

ALIEN
Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh
huh.

THE BOYS
No!

ALIEN
Don't piss on the moon, babe.

THE BOYS
NO!

ALIEN
All right, earthlings, what form do
you want me to take?

CARTMAN
How about a taco, that craps ice cream?
Guys?

STAN
I like it.

KENNY
(Me too.)

ALIEN
All right, then we can get back to business.
Follow me this way, earthlings.  I want
to apologize to you boys for all the
spooky, scary stuff. We just needed
to get to the malfunctioning uplink
relay.

STAN
You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?


ALIEN
That's right. See, there are dishes
in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums.
Your friend's has been malfunctioning.


KYLE
Why do you put them into people's asses?
Are you planning some kind of alien
takeover?

ALIEN
Oh, heavens no! We're a production company.
We make intergalactic television programs
that the whole universe watches.


STAN
Television?

ALIEN
We at Nerzod Productions started twenty
billion years ago with one philosophy:
the best universal television isn't
scripted, it's real.  We started with
great shows like, "Who Wants To Marry
A Gelgamek?" and "Antares 6 Millionaire".
And then we had a big hit with "Get
Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian". But
then of course, there's our signature
show. The greatest universal reality
show of all time.

KYLE
Earth?

ALIEN
A few billion years ago we realized,
"what if we took species from all different
planets in the universe, and put them
together, on the same planet?" Great
TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews,
deer and Hispanics, all trying to live
side by side on one planet! It's great!


STAN
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?


ALIEN
Well, you don't think the whole universe
works the way Earth does, do you? No!
One species, one planet! There's a planet
of deer, a planet of Asians, and so
on! We put them all together on Earth
and the whole universe tunes in to watch
the fun!

KYLE
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy
sitting around and watching us fight
and kill each other? Dude, that's messed
up.

ALIEN
Why?

STAN
Why?? Because you're playing with people's
lives! You're turning people's problems
into entertainment!

CARTMAN
Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth!


[The Convention Center, day.]

JEFF
Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently
come across an alien transmission that
is being beamed throughout the entire
universe.  When decoded, it looks like
this.

MAN
What does it mean?

JEFF
Ih it's simple mathematical language
that can be understood throughout the
solar system. Translated into our language,
it looks like this.

ANNOUNCER
This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's
everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's
been one hundred Gelganighs since we
first took species from seventeen different
planets and put them all together, on
the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought
and fallen in love! What will happen
this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight
to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!


JEFF
I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth,
is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV
show.

MAN 2
My God. We're famous!

JEFF
Waaaait, you don't understand!

MAN 3
I'm on TV! I'm on TV!

MAN 4
This is so awesome!

OTHERS
Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!!

[Back at Nerzod Productions. Cartman is bent over once more,
with his pants down. The visitors have finished working on him]


ALIEN
That should get the relay working again.
All right, Earthlings, if you'll step
over this way we'll erase your memories
and get you back to Earth.  Oh, excuse
me.  This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh
no, really? And it's, it's for sure?
All right, I'll break the news to everyone.
No, no I, I understand. Thanks.  Well,
you kids can go back to Earth if you
want, but I'm afraid it won't be there
for long. The show's been cancelled.


KYLE
What?? Who cancelled us?

NAGIX
The universal network heads. They say
the Earthlings have become aware of
the show, so it won't be fuinny anymore.


STAN
Oh shit, did we do that?

NAGIX
Everyone, can I have your attention
real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a
call from the network and I'm afraid
Earth has been cancelled

STAFF
Awww.

NAGIX
Now, now, it was a great run and I think
we should all be really proud.  Let's
call in a demolition crew to strike
the Earth for resources.

STAN
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this!
Uh, let us talk to the network heads!


NAGIX
Wouldn't do any good.

KYLE
Dude, we have to try!

STAN
Please, take us to them! Please!

NAGIX
All right, kids, we'll take you to the
network heads. But I warn you: nobody
has ever gotten the executives to uncancel
a show once the call has been made.
Nobody.

[Earth. A view of it from outer space. A few seconds later, an
immense crane floats towards Earth with wrecking ball ready and
beeper going. It stops. Two alien laborers sit inside and the
driver activates the crane arm. The wrecking ball moves and strikes
western Africa. A shot of people running across a bridge. The
whole planet moves as if by an earhquake. Chef almost loses his
balance at the space center as the ground undulates]

CHEF
What the hell is that?!

JEFF
There's a huge ship of some kind in
Earth's orbit!  But why? Wait a minute!
Chaos theory!

CHEF
Chaos theory??

JEFF
Chaos theory, ih wah, it was first thought
of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the
number of episodes they made of Punky
Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled...


CHEF
Huh?

JEFF
Don't you see? The show is over! The
aliens are cancelling Earth!

CHEF
Oh my God! We have to stop them!

[The boys walk down a futuristic sidewalk on a strange planet]


VOICE
Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the
Joozians, who control all media in the
universe.

RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?

STAN
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting
with the network heads?

RECEPTIONIST
Where are you visiting from?

STAN
Uh, Earth?

RECEPTIONIST
Oooo, I watch that show all the time.


JOOZIAN 1
Gaaahahaha.  Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings.
We're just checking out our new show.


JOOZIAN 2
We took a hundred beings from the planet
Marklar and put them on an asteroid
with sentient beings from the Horsehead
Nebula. Ih-it's a riot!

JOOZIAN 1
They hate each other!

JOOZIAN 2
Gah, why?

KYLE
Mighty powerful network executives,



We have come a great distance in order to ha-

JOOZIAN 1
Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have
haglar yet?

JOOZIAN 2
Oh yeah, let's do haglar.

JOOZIAN 1
Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?

JOOZIAN 2
Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh,
Blackafelch!

JOOZIAN 1
Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.

[Blackafelch Restaurant, later. Aliens of all kinds sit and enjoy
their meals.]

JOOZIAN 2
This place is fantastic!

STAN
Look, we just want to talk to you about
the show.

KYLE
Please don't cancel us. Please.

JOOZIAN 1
Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have
to realize the universe is a business.


JOOZIAN 2
You've made it to a hundred episodes,
you should be proud!

JOOZIAN 1
Yeah, a show should never go past a
hundred episodes, or else it starts
to get stale with ridiculously stupid
plotlines and settings.

WAITRESS
Here's yoiur order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah.


STAN
But sirs, we think our show is just
getting good.  I mean, we're just now
starting to see people get really pissed
off at each other.

KYLE
Oh my God, this is great!

JOOZIAN 1
You must have some Joozian ancestry.


CARTMAN
Tell us about it!

STAN
Look, there's five billion people on
our show. You just can't up and cancel
on us.

JOOZIAN 1
Oh my God! Would you look at the heglars
on that joozinek?

STAN
Dude, we're trying to save our planet
here?!

JOOZIAN 1
Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!


JOOZIAN 2
Oh, yeah!

[A hekmabah, a Joozian strip club. A Joozinek slithers around
a dance pole]

JOOZIAN 1
Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!

STAN
Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-

JOOZIAN 1
Oh, man, I am so wasted!  Hey, do you
Earthlings wanna try a little glach?
Agh-oh yeah!!  Oh, gluck yeah!!


KYLE
Kenny!

JOOZIAN 1
Meeh, screw this place! Let's go get
a hotel room and a hooker!

JOOZIAN 2
Oh yeah!

JOOZIAN 1
Yeah!

[Back on earth, the massive cranes swings at Earth again. More
quakes follow and the space center is damaged some more]

CHEF
We have to find a way to stop those
aliens!

JEFF
Oh, their ship is massive! There's
no way to stop it!  Wait a minute, jackets!


CHEF
Oh no.

JEFF
If people don't wear jackets they could
get cold. A cold is caused by a virus.
A viru- a computer virus! We could make
a computer virus and send it to their
ships to disable their computers!


CHEF
That doesn't make any God-damned sense!


[an adult hotel. The Joozians are in bed with a hooker and they
begin to disrobe]

JOOZIAN 2
Ogh.

JOOZIAN 1
Oh yeah!

JOOZIAN 2
Good.

JOOZIAN 1
Oh yeah! Yeah!!

JOOZIAN 2
Woohoohoo! Yeah!

JOOZIAN 1
Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a
party or what??

JOOZIAN 2
Oh! Oh, that's it baby! You're getting
my jagon hard!

JOOZIAN 1
Wohh. Yeah, let's party!

JOOZIAN 2
Yeah, suck my jagon!

JOOZIAN 1
Yeah! Now you suck on my jagon!  Oh
yeah!! Stick your finger in my thrusher!
Oh yeah, suck it. Suck that jagon!


STAN
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing
right now, but I have a feeling it's
really, really wrong.

JOOZIAN 1
Oh yes!! Oh yeah yeahyeah! Oh yeah!


[Back at universal network headquarters. The Joozians have ice
packs on their heads, recovering from the raunch they experienced
the night before]

JOOZIAN 2
Oh, God. Eh eh, my head.  What did we
do?

JOOZIAN 1
Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your
jagon.

JOOZIAN 2
Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons!
You kids won't tell anybody about this,
right??

CARTMAN
No.

STAN
No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if
you don't cancel our show!

JOOZIAN 1
Oooo, I knew that was coming.

JOOZIAN 2
They really got us by the nezmins

KYLE
The Earth show can still be good. Just
erase everyone's memory so we don't
know we're a show.

STAN
I'm sure you'll see that if you give
our world time, it will become even
more outrageous and violent.

CARTMAN
There's even World War Three to look
forward to.

KYLE
And then we won't have to show anybody
the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking
each other's jagons.

JOOZIAN 1
He-all right, all right Earthlings!
Ya, you win! The show can stay on.


THE BOYS
All right!

JOOZIAN 1
Just be sure to keep up the wars and
violence.

JOOZIAN 2
Well, we've got a five o'clock with
the Yurka producers.  Nice meeting you
Earthlings. Bye!

[The bus stop, day. Kenny is missing]

CARTMAN
Uuugh.

KYLE
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't
get much sleep last night.

CARTMAN
That's because I was having these bogus
nightmares all night long.

KENNY
(Hey you guys, look.)

KYLE
What the hell is that?

KENNY
(I don't know.)

CHEF
Hello there, children!

THE BOYS
Hey Chef.

STAN
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green
things sucking each other's shoulders.


CARTMAN
What is it, Chef?

CHEF
I don't know. But something tells me
this picture might be very important,
children.  You should hang on to it.


[TV spot]

ANNOUNCER
Attention universe! Be sure to tune
in next week for another exciting episode

"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 503


"THE SUPER BEST FRIENDS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, day. People mill around, but a group of them has
gathered around a magician, tall and slender, with a severe face]


MAGICIAN
Okay, Carol, put the card you picked
back into the deck so I can't see ittwah.


STAN
What's going on?

BUTTERS
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin'
magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that
ice cream?

BLAINE
Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd.
Was that the card you picked?

CAROL
No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of
hearts.

BLAINE
Four of hearts? Really? Look again.


CAROL
Daa-ah!

CROWD
Oooohhhh!

WOMAN
Whoa

KYLE
That's pretty cool, dude!

CARTMAN
Who's this asshole?

KYLE
He's a magician named David Blaine,
dude. He kicks ass.

CARTMAN
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?


BLAINE
Sir, c- could you come over here?  Now,
what I want you to do, Mr...

JIMBO
Kern.

BLAINE
Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think
about a card. Pick any card, and picture
it in your mind.

JIMBO
O-kay.

BLAINE
Okay, jus... s think about your card.
okay, look at me.  Look at me... Look
at me... okay, now reach up your ass.


JIMBO
Huh??

BLAINE
Go on, reach up your ass.

JIMBO
Uh, I don't feel nothin'.

BLAINE
Deeper.

JIMBO
Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait...
wait...

BLAINE
Was that the card you picked?

JIMBO
Yes! Oh my God!

MAN
O-hoho!

KYLE
Wow, that's cool!

STAN
How'd he do that??

BLAINE
Thank you. I've been traveling from
town to town for quite a while. I've
started quite a following, mostly because
of my levitation tricktwah. Watch.
Watch.

CROWD
Whoa!!!

STAN
No way!

KYLE
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in
the universe!

BLAINETOLOGIST
Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,
take a pamphlet.

KYLE
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about
David Blaine at the Center for Magic."
Dude, we gotta go.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and they probably teach you how
to do magic tricks!

[The David Blaine Complex, in the middle of nowhere, day.]

SPEAKER
Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and
I've been a Blainetologist for about
three years. So, when David Blaine performed
his miracles out on the street, what
moved you the most?

STAN
His a-miracles?

STEVEN
Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much
more than a magician. He's a scholar,
a visionary, a leader.

CARTMAN
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?


STAN
Yeah!

STEVEN
Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn:
I can show you how to make your true
self appear. Let me ask you all something:
Do you consider yourselves to be happy?


BUTTERS
I don't think I'm very happy. I always
fall asleep to the sounds of my own
screams.

STEVEN
...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that
you are unha-

BUTTERS
And then I always get woken up in the
morning by the sounds of my own screams.
Do you think I'm unhappy?

STEVEN
Wait, the.. the point is... that you
can be happy. You see, your friends
and parents have programmed you in a
way that makes you feel isolated and
alone. How many times have you felt
like nobody knows the real... you?
You're not really happy.

KYLE
I'm not really happy.

STEVEN
Your potential hasn't even been reached.


KYLE
My potential hasn't even been reached.


STEVEN
If you look through David Blaine's
incredible book, you'll find a lot of
life's answers. Let's read some of the
book together, shall we?

CARTMAN
Then we get to be in David Blaine's
secret club?

STEVEN
That's right.

CARTMAN
Cool.

[Kyle's house, day. In the dining room, Sheila is trying to feed
Ike, who is in a baby chair.]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Ike, eat your gefilte fish.

IKE
No-oo.

KYLE
Mom. Mom. I found out all about this
great new magician named David Blaine:


KYLE'S MOTHER
That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!

KYLE
We spent all afternoon learning about
how we aren't actually happy. I had
no idea how unhappy I was until today.
They gave me this cool book to read,
and I'm already on chapter four..


KYLE'S MOTHER
Well, it's nice to see you so interested
in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love
of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.


KYLE
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn
how to become a full member? All the
other guys are doin' it, and it's only
$69.95.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask
your father.  Ike, you will eat this!


[The David Blaine Complex, in the middle of nowhere, day. The
new recruits are having their hair shaved off their heads]


BARBER
Prepare to be cleansed and release the
magic inside you.

BUTTERS
I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure
got cold in here.

BARBER
Next?

[The David Blaine Complex, main room]

STEVEN
Congratulations, young Blainetologists.
From this day, you are clean.  Now,
we have very important work to do! David
Blaine is going to put on a big magic
show in Denver tonorrow night, where
he's going to eat his own head.

RECRUITS
Wow!

STEVEN
So it's up to all you new Blainetologists
to get as many people there as you can.
Whoever gets the most people to come
gets a prize!

STAN
Kyle, I'm starting to think that this
is a really bad idea.

BUTTERS
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought
you were Kyle.

STAN
No, I'm Stan.

KYLE
You're Stan? Where's Kenny?

STAN
Who are you?

KYLE
I'm Kyle.

CARTMAN
Heheh, guess who I am, guys?

STAN
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into
something bad here.

KYLE
What do you mean? We're learning all
kinds of cool stuff.

STAN
Look at us, dude. These people are trying
to change us somehow. I think it's time
we went home.

KYLE
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles
in Denver tomorrow..

STAN
I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me.


AIDE
Where are you going?

STAN
I'm going home.

AIDE
You don't want to go home.

STAN
You said we're free to leave whenever
we want

AIDE
You are.

STAN
Move out of the way.

AIDE
I'm not in the way. You are. Are you
unhappy with the Church's teachings?
Let's just talk about it

STAN
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus'
wanna leave.

AIDE
Why don't we go into the back room for
a second, and talk? Then you can leave.


STAN
That's okay, I... I changed my mind.
I'm... gonna stay.

AIDE
That's great news.

[The David Blaine Complex, dorm, night. Stan peers out from a
door into a hall.]

STAN
Okay, it's all clear.

KYLE
What are we doing?

STAN
We're getting out of here. This whole
thing has gotten way out of hand.


KYLE
Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.


STAN
Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!

KYLE
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my
life I feel like I'm part of something.


STAN
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's
crazy life plan?!

KYLE
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's
a brlliant man

STAN
No, they just convinced you that he's
a brilliant man! Let's go!

KYLE
I'm not going anywhere!

STAN
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I
wanna stay here!

KYLE
Huh? I thought you wanted to leave!


STAN
Oh wait, who am I again?

KYLE
You're Stan.

STAN
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on
a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm
getting out of here, and you're a dumbass
if you don't come back with me!

KYLE
Then I guess... I'm a dumbass.

STAN
Kyle, please.You-  You're my best friend.


KYLE
Well, this is what I believe in now,
Stan. And if you can't respectr that,...
then I guess we're not best friends
anymore.

[South Park, next day. Cartman and Kyle walk down a sidewalk
visiting houses. They approach a pink house.]

KYLE
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this
is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest
in David Blaine with you.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Uh oh. My husband warned me about you
Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.


CARTMAN
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blainetology
is for everyone. There are Blainetologists
who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even
Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.

KYLE
That's right.

ELDERLY WOMAN
So you're not a cult?

CARTMAN
Of course, no. David Blaine is a real
person. You may have seen his television
specials on ABC. He also wrote a book,
and we'd like to share it with you.


ELDERLY WOMAN
Well, alright, come on in.

CARTMAN
Cool.

[Elderly woman's house, living room, moments later. The woman
and the two boys sit on the sofa. Kyle has his book open.]


KYLE
...And if you look here, you can see
how David Blaine performed the miracle
of being frozen in ice at Times Square.


CARTMAN
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David
Blaine's plan is for you?

ELDERLY WOMAN
No, not really.

CARTMAN
Oh, you see, that, that's inteesting
because... I'm so thankful for David
Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful
that he showed me the way to true happiness
but, I think about his plan often.


KYLE
David Blaine is doing a big performance
in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure
his magic will entertain and astound
you!

CARTMAN
He's going to eat his own head.

KYLE
How many tickets can we put you down
for?

ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, I can't go.

CARTMAN
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy
person.

ELDERLY WOMAN
I am happy.

CARTMAN
No you're not.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Yes I am.

CARTMAN
No you're not.

ELDERLY WOMAN
I really am.

CARTMAN
No you're not.

ELDERLY WOMAN
But I am.

CARTMAN
No you're not.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Alright, two tickets

KYLE
Great!

[Sidewalk. Kyle and Cartman exit the elderly woman's house]


KYLE
That's 15 people we got to agree to
come see David Blaine perform in Denver.


CARTMAN
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work
is not over. We must still recruit ten
more audience members in order to get
the prize.

KYLE
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood,
we might find a-

CARTMAN
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time
for him.

STAN
HaaAAAA!

DRIVER
You'd better watch yourself next time,
abandoner!

[Jesus' house, next day. Stan walks up and rings the doorbell]


STAN
Hi, Jesus. It's me,

STAN, JESUS
Stan Marsh.

JESUS
Of course. I know you, my child. Come
in.

[Jesus' house, living room. A pitcher of water sits on the coffee
table]

STAN
This guy is going around doing magic
tricks and saying they're miracles!
My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!


JESUS
You're good to bring this to my attention,
Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.


STAN
I read in the Bible that you did miracles,
too. If you could go in front of these
people and do your miracles, then, they'll
all see that David Blaine isn't so special.


JESUS
The miracle I'm most famous for is turning
water into wine.

STAN
Can you do it agian?

JESUS
Very well. I shall perform the miracle.
Behold. Here you can see ordinary water,
clear, clean. Okay now, turn around.
Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay
now, turn back.  It is now wine!

STAN
That's it? That's how you did that trick?


JESUS
Wuh well, yeah.

STAN
That trick sucks, Jesus.

JESUS
Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little
better on people 2000 years ago.

STAN
Dude, we have to do something. This
guy is performing more miracles in Denver
tonight. He's gonna get more followers,
and it'll be impossible for me to get
Kyle out.

JESUS
Then let's go.

STAN
But dude, I'd I don't think you should
do that lame water-to-wine trick.


JESUS
Oh,don't worry  I have a few more miracles
up my sleeve.

[Denver, night. An arena is shown, and the place is packed. Kyle
and Cartman are seated in the third row, with around Blainetologists
around them]

TONIGHT

MAGICIAN

DAVID BLAINE

KYLE
This is a really good turnout.

ANNOUNCER
And now, ladies and gentlemen, David
Blaine.

BLAINE
Hello, my children.

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence,
please, as magician David Blaine will
now eat... his... own... head.

KYLE
Dude, no way!

BLAINE
Thank you, everyone.  Our organization
grows larger every day. Soon, the government
will even have to give us tax-exempt
status as a bona fide religion.

JESUS
Hold!

MAN
It's Jesus!

CARTMAN
What's he doin' here?

JESUS
My children, it is time for you to go
home and stop following this false prophet.
You should be using your money and time
for other things. These are simple magic
tricks. His magic is interesting, but
will it put food on your table? Feeding
the hungry - now that is a miracle!
Behold! I havd here fives loaves of
bread and three fish. Certainly not
enough to feed this entire crowd, but
now - turn around  Ya need tuh- turn
around.  Okay, now turn back.

CARTMAN
Now how the hell did he do that?

CROWD
Wow!

BLAINE
Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus!
twah. Just like you are.

JESUS
Oh, really. Then what's this  Ace of
Spades doing behind your ear?

CROWD
Whoa.

JESUS
Jesus Christ!

ELDERLY WOMAN
He's incredible!

BLAINE
The old religions have failed you! twah.
What have they offered except for war,
poverty, and sadness? Blainetology offers
you the key to living your life to the
fullest! Will you join us?

CROWD
Yes!!

[The arena, outside. Jesus and Stan exit the arena]

JESUS
His magic is too powerful, Stanley.
I've never seen anything like it.


STAN
Then what are we going to do.

JESUS
I cannot face him alone. We must get
the help of all the super best friends.
Buddha. Buddha, come in!

STAN
Super best friends?

BUDDHA
This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead.

[A futuristic headquarters, somewhere... Jesus appears on a giant
screen as Buddha awaits Jesus' answer]

JESUS
Buddha, we may have a problem. I've
just encountered a magic I've never
seen before.

BUDDHA
I'll call everyone together. Come as
fast as you can.

JESUS
Come, Stanley. We must travel far and
long.

STAN
To where?

JESUS
Distances unfathomable to man. Yea,
take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do
not open your eyes.

STAN
I am ready.

[Insde an airplane. Jesus and Stan have center seats, and Stan's
eyes are still shut]

JESUS
Are you still keeping your eyes clsoed?


STAN
Yeah.

JESUS
Good. Want some peanuts?

[The David Blaine Complex, night. Blainetologists gather in the
main room, and a new member is having his hair shaved off]


KYLE
Congratulations, sister. You have heard
the noble truth and are now a Blainetologist.


STEVEN
Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round!
I have great news for all Blainetologists,
and for our new members as well. We've
just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself:
The government has denied our church's
request for tax-exempt status!

MEMBER
But... we want tax-exempt status.

KYLE
Yeah. Why is that good news?

STEVEN
Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for
all Blainetologists members from every
city and state to march into Washington
and demand our right for tax-exepmt
status by committing a mass suicide!


KYLE
Mass suicide?

STEVEN
Mr. Blaine has said that by killing
ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed
everylasting happiness in the afterlife!


MEMBER
Hehehe, that sounds good.

STEVEN
Get your thngs ready. We leave for Washington
at dawn!

CARTMAN
Did you hear that, guys? We're finally
gonna die!

[A blue sky in a big city. The camera pans down to show Jesus
and Stan in a park-like setting]

JESUS
Alright, Stanley. You can open your
eyes now.  This is the hall of the super
best friends, Stanley, the headquarters
for those who stand for what's right.


MOHAMMED
Jesus, we've been working hard since
we got your distress call!

LOA TSE
Who the kid?

JESUS
Stanley, I want you to meet some of
the super best friends : Buddha, with
the powers of invisibility; Mohammed,
the Muslim prophet with the powers of
flame ; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Jospeh
Smith, the Mormom prophet; Lao Tse,
the found of Taoism ; and Sea-Man, with
the ability to breathe underwater and
link mentally with fish.

STAN
So you mean to tell me that even though
people fight and argue over different
religions, you guys are all actually
friends?

MOHAMMED
More than friends, young boy, we are
super best friends, with the desire
to fight for justice.

JOSEPH SMITH
We all believe in the power of good
over evil. Except for Buddha, of course,
who doesn't believe in evil.

STAN
Wow.

MOHAMMED
Jesus, come look at this.  After your
distress call, we entered David Blaine
in the super best friends' computer.


SEA-MAN
Many interesting things showed up.
He was raised in New York city by a
decent family, but a freak washing-machine
accident at the age of 12 made him learn
the ways of the black arts.

BUDDHA
That's right, Seaman.

SEA-MAN
Sea Man!

BUDDHA
Uh that's what I said. Sea Man.

SEA-MAN
Stop it!

[The David Blaine Complex, dorm, night. Kyle walks up to Cartman's
bunk.]

KYLE
Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!


CARTMAN
No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone!
Eyuh! Uh?

KYLE
It's jsut me.

CARTMAN
Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my
rest?

KYLE
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part
of this anymore.

CARTMAN
What?

KYLE
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway,
I think it's going too far. I mean,
if I kill myself, it's gonna make my
family really sad.

CARTMAN
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't
wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten
my pubes yet.

KYLE
I thnk we should bail. If we leave the
group, maybe other people will get the
courage to leave, too.

CARTMAN
That co- ugh.  That could be difficult,
Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why
don't we sleep on it? If we decide to
leave the faction, we can... do it in
the morning.

KYLE
Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman:
thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell?


[The David Blaine Complex, main room. The Blainetologists and
Cartman look on.]

CARTMAN
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.


KYLE
What have you done, Cartman?!

CARTMAN
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.


BLAINE
You must understand, brother Kyle, twah,
you know too much about the Church.
If you left now, you'd become a danger
to our cause.

CARTMAN
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said?
Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all
gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't
do iiit.

KYLE
Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!

CARTMAN
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic
bubble!

BLAINE
The suicide pact will go as planned.
If we die, we all die together.

[the Hall of the Super Best Friends, day.]

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best
Friends...

JOSEPH SMITH
Look at that, Jesus. His followers are
growing at a rate even faster than mine!
It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous
as you and your young friend had feared.


STAN
I knew it.

JESUS
Here. I have a videotape of his performance
the other night.

JOSEPH SMITH
Perhaps we should have Moses look at
the tape and see what he comes up with.


MOHAMMED
Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell
us the source of Blaine's power?

MOSES
Give me the information.

STAN
Wow, the Moses.

MOSES
His magic is a combination of centrifugal
line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute:
I'm picking up movement from Blainetologists
from all over the country.

LAO TSE
The Blainetologists are heading to Washington.
But why?

JESUS
Wait a minute. At his performance David
Blaine said something about trying to
get tax-exempt status.

JOSEPH SMITH
Omigod!

LAO TSE
What?

JOSEPH SMITH
If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll
become a real religion.

KRISHNA
He would become unstoppable

[Washington D.C., day. The Blainetologists have gathered around
the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial]

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, in the nation's capital,
Blainetologists from all over the country
have gathered to commit mass suicide!


BLAINE
If the government will not give us
tax-exempt status, then we must prove
that we are willing to die for our beliefs,
twah.

STEVEN
Alright, brothers and sisters, gather
around.  It's time to drown ourselves
in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah
Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow
than we originally thought, so to drown
ourselves, you will need to lie on your
stomach, face down, until you die, as
such.

MAN
Next!

[The White House, day. The White House staff gathers at one of
the windows to watch. Shown are Princess, Luara and George W.
Bush, Karl Rove, and Maggie]

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, at the White House...

KARL ROVE
Mr. President, we can't let them all
kill themselves!

GEORGE BUSH
Well we can't give them tax-exempt status,
either, Karl!

LARRY
He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?

[Washington D.C., day. Cartman gets ready to flood Kyle, who's
still in the glass dome, with a fire hose. More corpses float
in the Reflecting Pool]

CARTMAN
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for
us to die!

KYLE
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't
you see? We don't have to do this!


CARTMAN
But it's the only way for us to be
happy.

KYLE
Cartman, no!

[The Reflecting Pool, later]

BLAINE
Give us what we want or we will continue
to die

JESUS
Not so fast, David Blaine!

BLAINE
Jesus! Not again.

JESUS
Yes! But this time, I've brought some
help! Super Best Friends!

BUDDHA
Buddha!

MOHAMMED
Mohammed!

JOSEPH SMITH
Joseph Smith!

KRISHNA
Krishna!

LAO TSE
Lao Tse!

SEA-MAN
Sea-Man!

JESUS
The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And
so are you!

BLAINE
I don't think so. Get them!

JOSEPH SMITH
My ice breath should take care of you.


STAN
Kyle! Kyle!

BLAINETOLOGIST
Sweet Salvation!

STAN
Kyle??  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!


KYLE
You bastards!

STAN
Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!


KYLE
You bastards!

STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

JESUS
That takes care of them.

JOSEPH SMITH
Now it's your turn, Blaine!

BLAINE
Perhaps you need to see some real magic.


LINCOLN
Raaargh!

BUDDHA
Oh this looks like trouble.

BLAINE
So long, Super Best Fools!

STAN
Kyle!

KYLE
Stan!

STAN
Kyle, you can't kill yourself!

KYLE
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged
this thing to fill with water!

JESUS
We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham
Lincoln! Mohammed!  Great Scott!

CARTMAN
Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try agian.
Hep .

[Shot of Washington D.C. from the Vietnam Memorial. Lincoln is
taking buildings off their foundations and tossing them aside.
Krishna, in the form of an eagle, flies over the scene. Flames
are everywhere.]

MOHAMMED
It is too powerful, Jesus!

KRISHNA
It seems to have no weakness!

JESUS
There has to be a way to destroy it.
Jesus to Moses!

[The Hall of Super Best Friends, day, at that moment]

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends
League...

JESUS
Come in, Moses!

MOSES
What?

JESUS
We need to know how to kill a giant
stone Abraham Lincoln.

MOSES
...Um... Let me think, um... a giant
stone John Wilkes Booth?

JESUS
You heard him, Super Best Friends!
We've got to make a giant stone John
Wilkes Booth!

MOHAMMED
Krishna, we're going to need wood for
a mold!

KRISHNA
Form of... a beaver!

MOHAMMED
I will find sources to concrete.  You,
get the water to mix it with, Seaman.


NARRATOR
Using the wood that Krishna cut down
as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry
skills to make a giant mold.

JESUS
That should do the trick. Now for some
concrete.

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman
seeks out water to mix with the concrete.


SEA-MAN
Sea-Man!  Look, Swallow, we should be
able to divert the water with that pipe.


NARRATOR
And so, Seaman and Swallow get to...
get to work

[The Reflecting Pool, later. Water fills the bubble Kyle is in,
and he struggles to breathe]

STAN
Kyle, you have to hold yoru breath!
Oh, very funny!

JESUS
Lao Tse, bring it to life.

NARRATOR
Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes
one with the giant stone John Wilkes
Booth.

KYLE
Wagh.

JESUS
It worked. Now freeze over the pool
so no one else can drown themselves!


CARTMAN
Hey, I was just about to do it.

[The Reflecting Pool, later. The crowd of Blainetologists is
still there, and the water has melted]

NARRATOR
Later, at the exact same location...


BLAINE
Damn you, Super Best Friends!

JESUS
Your magic is no match for our powers
combined, Blaine!

BLAINE
Then I guess you win this time, Super
Best Fools! But I'll be back!

JESUS
Goddamnit!

BUDDHA
It's alright. Everything is as it should
be.

JESUS
Oh, shut up, Buddha!

STEVEN
Our leader, he... he's leaving us!


BLAINETOLOGIST
Don't leave us, David Blaine!

STAN
Listen up, everyone!  You don't need
David Blaine to tell you how to live.
See, cults are dangerous because they
promise you hope, happiness and, maybe
even an afterlife. But in return, they
demand you pay money. Any religion that
requires you to pay money in order to
move up and... learn its tenets is wrong.
See, all religions have something valuable
to teach, but, just like the Super Best
Friends learned, it requires a little
bit of them all.

BLAINETOLOGIST
He's right. He... he's right!

KYLE
Thanks for savign us Stan. You're my
Super Best Friend.

STAN
Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.


CARTMAN
Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna
go get a room so you can make out for
a while? Heheheheheh

KYLE
Haha, hehahaha.

CARTMAN
Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah!

JESUS
Well, it looks like everything worked
out.

NARRATOR
And so, Jesus and his companios leave
Washington. But their return is assured,
for there will always be a need for...
the Super Best Friends!

"TOWELIE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are in the living room
playing video games.]

KYLE
HA! I killed you!

STAN
HA, I blew your head off!

KENNY
(Aw, Goddamnit!)

STAN
Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?


KYLE
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20!
You giving birth in there, or what?


CARTMAN
Let a man take a crap!

STAN
Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.


KYLE
Hyeah, that poor, poor thing

STAN
Come on, Cartman! You're missing the
game!

CARTMAN
I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm
just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell
is that?  You guys, look what I found
in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom.
It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped
in toilet paper.

KYLE
Well, why did you pull it out of the
trash?

CARTMAN
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut,
but look, check it out, it's all bloody.


SHARON
Are you guys still playing that video
game?

STAN
Yeah. Hay Mom, Cartman found a bloody
cotton thing in the bathroom.

CARTMAN
Look.  But I don't think it's for usin',
I think it's just for lookin' through.


SHARON
Eric, put that down!

CARTMAN
Why?

SHARON
Just go put it back in the trashcan!


CARTMAN
Hey, it's like all bloody. It might
be alive.

SHARON
No that... that came from me; just put
it away.

CARTMAN
This came out of you?? You just left
it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta
done that. He's just a boih. Poor little
feller.

STAN
What is it, Mom?

KYLE
Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?

SHARON
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright,
it's a personal, woman thing.  I tell
you what: If you'll just drop the whole
thing right now, I'll buy you that new
video game console you've been wanting.


STAN
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?

SHARON
Sure.

KYLE
Cool!

CARTMAN
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold,
you guiys!

[Luau's Toys, day, later. A banner reading "WE HAVE GAMESPHERE"
hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window
display.]

STAN
There it is. The Okama GameSphere.


KYLE
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight
gigahertz DRAM

STAN
What's that?

KYLE
I don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow,
dude, you're the luckiest kid in South
Park.

CARTMAN
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one
who found Stan's aborted brother in
the trashcan and blackmailed his mom
into getting the GameSphere.

STAN
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta
see if you can sleep over for the rest
of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30
- that means we have... 39 hours to
play GameSphere until school on Monday!


KENNY
(Woohoo!)

KYLE
Awesome!  Oh, crap.

STAN
What?

KYLE
I'm supposed to go to the lake with
my family tomorrow and swim and play
in the stupid sun.

STAN
Dude, we got GameSphere.

KYLE
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay
over anyway so I can play for... eighteen
hours, and then I'll go to the lake.


TOWELIE
Don't forget to bring a towel.

STAN
What?

TOWELIE
When you get out of the water you need
to dry off right away to avoid catchin'
a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't
forget to bring a towel."

STAN
...O-kay.

KYLE
Thanks, Towelie.

Towelie	[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?


STAN
No.

KYLE
Anyway, that will give me plenty of
time playing video games.

CARTMAN
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama
GameSphere.

SHARON
Here you go, boys.

BOYS
AAAAAA.

[Stan's house, later. In the living room, Kyle finishes connecting
the GameSphere to the back of the TV]

KYLE
Okay, turn it on.

TV
"Okama GameSphere"

BOYS
Whoa!

TV
Thirst For BLOOD

CARTMAN
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.


KYLE
Oh, this is so cool.

CARTMAN
Bring it, bring it!

[Stan's house, night. The boys have been playing for hours. Around
them are empty boxes of Cheesy Poofs and cans of Zoop soda. On
the sofa is a bag of chips. Stan's parents walk up to the boys.]


SHARON
Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.


STAN
G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.


CARTMAN
Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done
that. 'E's just a boih.

RANDY
What?

SHARON
Nothing. Come on, Randy.

[Stan's house, Sunday morning, dawn. The boys have stayed up
all night playing video games. Kyle is on the phone with his
parents.]

KYLE
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake.
No, S-stan's having emotional problems
and I need to help see him through it.
He's got-  wha-what is it?

CARTMAN
Date-rape psychosis.

KYLE
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will.
Okay, thanks, Mon.  I don't have to
go outside!

CARTMAN
Awesome!

KYLE
She said it's fine, but that I still
have to go to baseball practice tonight..


STAN
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today.
God damnit!

CARTMAN
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities!
We're children!

STAN
Well, it's alright. We can still play
for  six more hours, and then we'll
go play baseball.

TOWELIE
Don't forget to bring a towel.

KYLE
Uh no.

TOWELIE
When you're playin' sports, the sweat
can get in your face. That's why Towelie
says, "Always keep an extra towel in
your duffle bag."

STAN
Okay, we will.

TOWELIE
Alright!  Do you wanna get high?

KYLE
No we don't wanna get high!

TOWELIE
Okay... You sure?

CARTMAN
Yes! Go away, you stupid towel!

STAN
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off
your face and ate it!

CARTMAN
That's... so... cool!

[Stan's house, later... The boys have repositioned themselves
and look half-asleep from all the game play. Doughnuts and ice
cream appear - a cone is on the rug with its ice cream melting.
Sharon walks up to them again.]

SHARON
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go
now.

STAN
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't
go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle
has cancer.

SHARON
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You
have to go to school.

CARTMAN
It's Monday?

STAN
Oh, uh, I'm sick.

KYLE
Me too.

SHARON
No, you're not sick. Now get to school.
All of you.

STAN
But Mom...

SHARNO
Go!

BOYS
Aagh!

[Bus stop, moments later. The boys are now waiting for the bus.]


STAN
Can't believe we have to go to school!


KYLE
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.


STAN
We just have to try and make the day
go as fast as possible so we can get
back to GameSphere.

COMMANDER
Hello, boys, how are you?

STAN
Fine.

COMMANDER
Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd,
but... have you see a ...talking ...towel
around anywhere.

KYLE
What? You mean Towelie?

COMMANDER
Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code
5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat!
Code 5, Park County Colorado!

CARTMAN
What, dude?

STAN
This is gonna be one looong-ass day.


[Stan's house, Mondy afternoon. The boys arrive there from the
bus stop]

STAN
That was the longest day of school ever!


KYLE
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to
level 29!

[Stan's house, living room. The boys stand in from of the television]


KYLE
Where is it?

STAN
It... it was right here.

KYLE
Where the hell is it??

CARTMAN
Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need
my fix!

STAN
Hello?

VOICE
If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere
again, you will bring us the towel.


STAN
What? Who-who is this?

VOICE
Just get the towel and meet us at the
gas station outside of town. Or else!


STAN
Don't hurt it!

KYLE
What?

STAN
They've taken it. They've taken our
Okama GameSphere.

CARTMAN
No! ...No!

KYLE
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken
it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This
isn't happening!!

[South Park, sunset. The boys walk down Main Street.]

STAN
Towelie!

CARTMAN
Hey, towel!

KYLE
Where the hell is he?

KENNY
(I don't know. Where could it be?)


STAN
I don't know. They guy on the phone
thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta
find him.

KYLE
What has this world come to? Where people
can just... take your Okama GameSphere.


CARTMAN
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call.
Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!

KYLE
That's a towel call?

STAN
This is hopeless. We're never gonna
find him.

KYLE
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed
up to give us towel advice when we'd
said something about water.

STAN
Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the
swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take
a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!

TOWELIE
Don't forget to bring a towel.

KYLE
There he is!

TOWELIE
Be sure to bring a towel so you don't
get aaall wet. .

STAN
Come on, dude!

TOWELIE
Where are we goin'?

KYLE
Just come on! It's getting dark.

TOWELIE
Are we gonna get high?

[Outskirts of South Park, night. A full moon shines down on the
boys as they reach the gas station]

KYLE
Are you sure this is where they said
to be?

STAN
They said the gas station outside of
town.

TOWELIE
Well, I'm gonna get a little high.


MAN
Hold it!

STAN
Who is that?

MAN
Step... away... from the towel!

OFFICIAL
There you are, towel. We've been looking
all over for you.

TOWELIE
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to
bring your own towel.

OFFICIAL
It isn't safe for you out here, towel.
There are people out here to mean to
harm you.

STAN
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere
back? We just wanna play video games.


OFFICIAL
Your what?

KYLE
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24,
about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!


OFFICIAL
I don't know what you're talking about.


STAN
You called us and said if we brought
the towel you'd give us our video game
back.

OFFICIAL
Omigod!  IT"S A TRAP!!

MAN 2
Cover! Cover!

STAN
Goddamnit, what now?!

OFFICIAL
Run, towel!

STAN
Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our
video game around here somwhere.


SOLDIER 1
Where's the towel?!

SOLDIER 2
It can't be far!  Alvarez, you and Mitchell
sweep left!

GUARD
Hurry! You must get the towel back
to Tynacorp!

STAN
Where is our Okama GameSphere?

GUARD
Get the towel home  They will explain
everything. Please, hurry!

KYLE
Aw, God-damnit!

STAN
Do you know where he's talking about,
Towelie?

TOWELIE
What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's
a long ways away.

STAN
Alright, we're gonna have to use this
truck. Come on, guys.

COMMANDER
Well?

SOLDIER
They've gone, sir. It's like they've
vanished out of thin air.

COMMANDER
Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting
that towel.  They must have some unexplainable
bond with it.

SOLDIER 2
Perhaps they're telepathically linked
to the towel, sir, like E.T.

COMMANDER
It could already be anywhere, hiding
out again. No, the time for being nice
is over. We must instigate... Plan B.


SOLDIER 3
You mean...?

COMMANDER
Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand
mile radius.

[A desert, later that night. The truck rolls along... Stan steers,
Kyle, Towelie, and Cartman ride along. Kenny mans the pedals]


KYLE
Are we getting close?

TOWELIE
I think so.

STAN
A little more gas, Kenny.

KYLE
How long has it been since you've been
back there.

TOWELIE
I've been wanderin' around on my own
for the past few weeks. You know, helpin'
people out with towel safety and proper
towel use. It's important.

CARTMAN
No it isn't.

TOWELIE
Is!

CARTMAN
No it isn't.

TOWELIE
Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down
this dirt road.

STAN
Brake, Kenny, brake.

CARTMAN
Egh!

TOWELIE
M-maybe it's down that dirt road.

STAN
Dude, don't you remember where it is?


TOWELIE
I can't remember, it all looks the same.
Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll
remember where it is.

STAN
Alright, so where is it?

TOWELIE
Where's what?

BOYS
Agh!

KYLE
The base where you're from and where
our Okama GameSphere is!

STAN
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily,
Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just
about had it with you!

TOWELIE
Well calm down.

KYLE
That's it!  You're not getting high
again until we have our Okama GameSphere
back!

TOWELIE
That's my last joint, asshole!

KYLE
I don't care! You'd better remember
where your base is!

TOWELIE
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today?
God-damnit.

[A purple house, night. Inside, in the restroom, a woman washes
her hands and face, then pulls a towel out of its rack to dry
herself]

WOMAN
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato
salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that
you?

SOLDIER
Harris! Reach bang and clear!

WOMAN
Hello?  WAAH!  Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod!


SOLDIER
Alright, it's clear! It's clear!

[a backyard. Mrs. Tweek pulls down some clothes she's had drying
on clotheslines. As she nears the towels, three soldiers rush
in and start firing away at them]

SOLDIERS
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!


SOLDIER
Let's go let'sg o!

[A men's gym shower, night. Mr. Garrison is in the shower with
two other men. He finishes and wraps a white towel with blue
stripes around his waist, then walks towards his locker]

SOLDIER
Get it!

MR. GARRISON
What the?

SOLDIER
Throw it down!

MR. GARRISON
Oh alright, have your way with me if
you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures!


SOLDIER
Alright, let's go!

MR. GARRISON
Huh where are you goin'?

[The truck the boys are driving pulls up in front of a gleaming
glass building with "TYNACORP" above the entrance, and the boys
pour out with Towelie]

CARTMAN
This is where you came from?

TOWELIE
Yeah, I think so.  Oh man.

STAN
What?

TOWELIE
I'm so high right now. I have no idea
what's goin' on.

[Tynacorp, inside. The boys walk down a long passageway]

RESEARCH LEADER
Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.

STAN
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere
is?

KYLE
We're missing out on some quality video
game time right now.

RESEARCH LEADER
Thank you for bringing him to us, boys.
You see, this is not an ordinary towel.
He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed
with a computer chip inside the terry
cloth

STAN
We don't care.

RESEARCH LEADER
You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal
was to make the perfect towel. A towel
that would sense how wet or dry the
user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.


STAN
Dude, we don't care.

RESEARCH LEADER
Towelie was our greatest success. Smart
enough to beat the average human at
chess and absorbent enough to soak up
even the toughest spills. But then one
day, Towelie got high and just sort
of wandered off.

STAN
We... don't... care.

KYLE
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama
GameSphere?

RESEARCH LEADER
Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid
that what we all experienced was a trap.
They called you and said to bring the
towel, and then they called us and said
they were bringing Towelie back. Their
plan was to wipe us all out with one
fell swoop.

KYLE
Who's they?

RESEARCH LEADER
Why, the military. You see, after Towelie
got high and wandered off from here,
the military got a hold of him. They
wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon
of mass destruction.

STAN
Don't care, don't care, don't care.


RESEARCH LEADER
Towelie was at their base for months
as they tried to copy his TNA. But then,
one day, Towelie got high and just sort
of wandered off. Again.

CARTMAN
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get
back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!


RESEARCH LEADER
I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere
is at "their" base.

STAN
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?


RESEARCH LEADER
You mean to go right into their base?
Of course. The entry code should still
be in Towelie's memory banks. You could
sneak him in there and recover his TNA.
Great plan.

[Secret Government Base, night. Inside, various military officials
man a command center. Two soldiers walk up to the commander and
salute him]

SOLDIER
Sir! Sargeant Masters and Boll are reporting,
sir!

COMMANDER
Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish
your primary goal?

SGT MASTERS
Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed!
The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.


COMMANDER
Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.


SGT BOLL
Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left
within a hundred miles.

COMMANDER
Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain
to me why we just got footage of the
towel returning to Tynacorp?!

SGT MASTERS
Oo we...

SGT BOLL
He must have outsmarted us, sir.

COMMANDER
Well I'm through playing hide and seek!
We've got no other choice! Prepare to
blow up all of Colorado!

[The night sky. Clouds float by overhead, past the full moon.
A helicopter flies into the sky and the camera follows it. Two
officials prepare the boys for dives into the military base as
the research leader talks]

RESEARCH LEADER
In a moment we will be over the base.
This is the only way in. Any attempts
on the ground would be easily spotted
by guard posts.

KYLE
Okay.

RESEARCH LEADER
I hate to send you back in there, Towelie,
but only you have their security system
in your memory banks.

TOWELIE
That's alright. It's always good to
bring a towel.

RESEARCH LEADER
Good luck, boys. The fate of the world
is depending on you.

STAN
We're not doing it for the world, we're
doing it for our video game. God, are
you deaf?

GUARD
Alright, boys. When you drop from the
plane, cover and roll. Got it?

STAN
Yeah.

GUARD
Go go go go go go!

KYLE
Dude, I figured it out.

STAN
What?

KYLE
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere
in 30 minutes, we could still be back
at your house playing video games by
midnight!

STAN
So that'd be, like what, eight hours
we could play before school?

KYLE
Seven and a half.

STAN
Hurry up, stupid parachute!

[Secret Government Base, night. The boys land silently and start
walking]

Cartman	Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government
Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching
the gate]

TOWELIE
Let's see.  No.

STAN
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have
the security system in your memory banks.


TOWELIE
Hey it's been a long time!

CARTMAN
You just have no long-term memory 'cause
you get high all the time!

TOWELIE
Don't preach to me, fatso!

CARTMAN
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause
you're stupid!

TOWELIE
You're stupid!

CARTMAN
Yeah, and you're a towel!

TOWELIE
You're a towel!  Just let me get high.
I know I can remember if I get high.


STAN
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's
your stupid lighter.

TOWELIE
Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it!


KYLE
That's it?

TOWELIE
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town."
Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.


STAN
No, Towelie, the entry code!

TOWELIE
For what?

STAN
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have
to climb the stupid fence.

[Secret Government Base, night, inside. The boys climb over the
fence and sneak past a soldier without arousing suspicion. They
end up at the genetic research building]

KYLE
Well let's look in here.

TOWELIE CLONE
Kill... me... Kill... me.

TOWELIE
Oh my God! No-o-o-o!

COMMANDER
Well well well. Look what the cat dragged
in.

TOWELIE
What are these things?

COMMANDER
Genetic copies we tried to make with
your TNA. They didn't work too well,
I'm afraid.

TOWELIE CLONE
Kill... me.

STAN
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?

COMMANDER
You did very well to get the towel this
far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell
you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government
wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie
as a weapon? Now let me tell you the
real story.

STAN
Oh God, don't care, don't care.

COMMANDER
Yes, we've been trying to make our
own genetic copies of the towel, but
only because we had to. You see, when
we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered
a certain, terrifying secret.

SOLDIER
Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.


KYLE
What terrifying secret?

COMMANDER
That Tynacorp was making these towels
to take over the world!

CARTMAN
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere
again, are we?

COMMANDER
Don't you see what genetically enhanced
smart towels like these are capable
of? You get out of the shower and dry
yourself off. But even after you're
dry, the towel makes you more dry. It
keeps getting you drier and drier.
Can you imagine it? What it would feel
like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell
you something: You don't want to know.
And I don't know.

KYLE
And we don't care.

COMMANDER
You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp,
kids. They set this all up to get you
in here and take us down.

STAN
So let me get this straight: Our Okama
GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.

COMMANDER
Oh yes. It has been all along.

SOLDIER
Can I kill the towel now, sir?

KYLE
Go ahead.

COMMANDER
No, wait.  Perhaps now, we can use their
own towel against them. These boys must
return to Tynacorp, and we will launch
a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well.
You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's
central core, and upload this encryption
disk into their system, bringing them
down once and for all.

STAN
But we don't care!

[Tynacorp command center. The officials gather around the research
leader]

OFFICIAL 1
What the hell is this?! The towel was
supposed to go in there and then run
its own self-destruct sequence!

RESEARCH LEADER
The towel has a will of its own. It's...
learning compassion.

OFFICIAL 2
We don't have the manpower to hold off
the entire military AND stop those wonderboys
from getting to the core!

RESEARCH LEADER
Then we have no choice. We'll have to
test the new prototype a little... earlier.


GS-401	[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!

[Tynacorp, outside. Shadows appear in the brush across the way.
The commander is there with his troops, the boys, and Towelie]


COMMANDER
Alright, boys, take the towel back in
there and say your mission was accomplished.
Then upload this encryption disk into
their computers.

STAN
We're just going in to get our video
game back.

COMMANDER
If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed
photon rifle.

KYLE
Photon rifle, whatever.

[Tynacorp command center. The boys walk through the center slowly]


STAN
Hello? Hello, anybody here?

GS-401
Welcome to the party, boys!  HAAARRRHHHH!!


Towelie	Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.

GS-401
HAAARRRHHHH!!

RESEARCH LEADER
So, you thought you could outsmart us,
did you kids?

COMMANDER
Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move
move!  Don't make a move, you bastards!


RESEARCH LEADER
Bring the towel here, boys. They can't
shoot children.

COMMANDER
Don't listen to them. They lied to you
before.

RESEARCH LEADER
Oh yes, boys. Obey your government!
Well perhaps it's time these boys knew
what was really gong on!

STAN
Ohmigod, look!

KYLE
Our GamdSphere!

STAN
Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays.


RESEARCH LEADER
You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed.
If they were the military, why wouldn't
they just attack us to begin with? Because
they're not the military!

COMMANDER
Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it
was to protect your own skin! We are
a resistance group pretending to be
the military to bring Tynacorp down!


CARTMAN
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute
level.

KYLE
Sweet!

COMMANDER
But perhaps we should show these kids
who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go
on! Tell them why you've been making
towels! Zytar!

STAN
Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!


ZYTAR
Our planet was dying! We had no choice
but to find a new one! Manufacturing
Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans
to see how they lived.

COMMANDER
And now you know the horrible truth,
boys.

ZYTAR
Truth or no, your alien-murdering group
is over!

CARTMAN
Could you turn it up?

COMMANDER
Boys, try to reach the core override!
We've got no choice but to try to take
them all out!  I think I can get it
from here, boys!

ZYTAR
What are you doing? You'll kill us
all!

COMMANDER
Sorry, Zytar. Didn't yoru mom ever tell
you? Don't mess with earthlings.


BOYS
Oooww!

CARTMAN
Hup hup. Come on, hang on.

STAN, KYLE
Whoa.

KENNY
(Help help! Heeelllppp!)

CARTMAN
Kenny!

KENNY
(Nooo!)

KYLE
Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta
move me closer!

STAN
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming
apart!

GS-401
What are you doing?

TOWELIE
Get away from me, you evil towel!

GS-401
Towelie, listen to me. Let them go.
Drop them.

TOWELIE
No way! They're my friends!

GS-401
They aren't your friends! Humans have
ruined the planet, killed off their
own environment! Their time is over.
It is the towels' turn now.

KYLE
I've almost got it!

GS-401
You're going to let them go, Towelie!
Because... I know your weakness.  Here.
Yoiu can reach it. Come on, Towelie!
How long has it been since you've had
a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!


STAN
Aw, crap!

GS-401
You're going to have to choose between
their lives, and, getting high.

TOWELIE
You asshole.

CARTMAN
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned
towel! Kyle's almost there!

GS-401
Come, Towelie! Make your decision!


TOWELIE
I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both!


KYLE
I got it!

GS-401
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

STAN
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!


KYLE, TOWELIE
Alright!

CARTMAN
Hooray!

STAN
Oh, dude, we finished level 50!

KYLE
Awesome!

TOWELIE
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin'
on.

KYLE
Check it out: Now we're going into the
secret underground base.

STAN
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this
is gonna be an underwater level.

TOWELIE
Don't forget to bring a towel.

CARTMAN
You are the worst character ever, Towelie.


TOWELIE
I know.

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 613


"THE RETURN OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF
THE RING TO THE TWO TOWERS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Stan's house, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand in the living
room in costume]

STAN
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest
do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?


CARTMAN
Only one thing can save our kingdom.
You must bring me: a piece of pecan
pie with toffee ice cream and magic
shell. Hurry now!

KYLE
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of
another one!

RANDY
Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to
borrow the Lord of the Rings video we
rented. Could you take it over to them?


STAN
You're sending us on... a quest? You
ask of us to take the one video to the
House of Butters?

RANDY
Yeah, whatever.

CARTMAN
It shall be a long journey with many
dangers on the way.

KYLE
But if the tape must be brought to the
House of Butters, who else can do it?


STAN
Very well, we shall embark on this
quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!


THE BOYS
Ho!

RANDY
Hmmm, that gets rid of them.

SHARON
Ooo, you're a little frisky, aren't
you?

RANDY
Yeah, well uh, the Lord of the Rings
wasn't the only thing I rented from
the video store.  I also rented... a
porno.

SHARON
Oho, you little devil.

RANDY
Youuu wanna go watch?

[The neighborhood streets, night. The boys are well into their
quest]

STAN
How shall we journey to the house of
Butters? Through the mines of Endor
or over the mountains of Grog?

KYLE
Look out! Here comes the great dragon
of Perengraph!

CARTMAN
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart.
I can shield us from the dragon's fire.


STAN
Good job, wizard.

CARTMAN
And so the party journeyed onward: the
great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and
the covetous Jew.

KYLE
I'm a Paladin, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Jews can't be Paladins.

[Stan's house, night. As the kid journey, Randy and Sharon are
in their room getting ready for a night of porno. Sharon appears
in a ruby lingerie, leans suggestively against the doorway of
the master bathroom and runs her finger along the bedroom wall.
Randy takes the porno to the TV]

SHARON
Hey there, cowboy.

RANDY
You ready for some hot, steamy fun?


SHARON
You bet I am!

RANDY
The guys at the office told me I had
to rent this porno. They said "this
is without a doubt thee hottest porno
ever made."

SHARON
Mmm, sounds good.

RANDY
I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like
that?

SHARON
Mm, yeah baby.

RANDY
Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?

SHARON
Ready?

RANDY
Oh yeah.

NARRATOR
The story begins in ages past, in the
deep regions of Middle Earth, where
Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of
Gelgelar.

RANDY
Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have
a story.

NARRATOR
Seven rings were cast and given to the
races of men.

RANDY
Oh yeah.

NARRATOR
Seven, to the races of elves, five to
the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor.


SHARON
Wow, the production values are really
good in this porno.

RANDY
Yeah, it almost looks like... the Lord
of the...  OH MY GOD! <> This is Lord
of the Rings!!

SHARON
But then that means...!

RANDY
The boys have the hottest porno ever
made!

[Night, Butters' house. The boys approach. Kyle knocks, Mr. Stotch
answers, Mrs. Stotch arrives a moment later]

CHRIS
Oh, hello boys.

STAN
My father has asked that we bring you
this copy of Lord of the Rings.

CHRIS
Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.


CARTMAN
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold?
Frankensteincense?

CHRIS
Oh, but you are noble heroes! We know
our thanks is enough.

CARTMAN
Man, that's crap.

[Butters' house, basement. Butters is drawing something on paper.
His parents descend with video in hand]

CHRIS
Butters,  look what we have for you
to watch: the Lord of the Rings.

BUTTERS
Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!


LINDA
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes,
so you can watch this by yourself and
not get scared?

BUTTERS
Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!


CHRIS
That's our man. Here you go.

BUTTERS
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see,
the Lord of the- Rings.

MAN
Spank that ass

BUTTERS
Whoa.  Neato.  Well, this is good.


[The Marsh car. Randy drives, Sharon worries. They have donned
pajamas and thrown on coats]

SHARON
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarassing.
"Hi Chris, Hi Linda. We were just wondering
if we could get our porno back."


RANDY
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten
there yet.

[The woods, night. As Randy and Sharon head for Butters' house,
the boys walk home through backwoods]

CARTMAN
And so the party returns home after
completing their great quest.

STAN
The one tape was returned and South
Park was again at peace.

KYLE
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!

CARTMAN
Prepare for battle!

SHARON
The boys!

RANDY
Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?


STAN
We gave it to the parents of Butters
as commanded by you.

SHARON
Awgh, I gues we have to go talk to 'em
now.

RANDY
Wellll, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do
you think you can go get that tape back
for us really fast?

CARTMAN
This sounds like a really important
quest.

RANDY
Yes, it is. It is more important than
anything I've ever asked you to do.
You must retrieve the tape. But do not
look at it, uh, for it ...holds an evil
power! Retrieve the tape, and return
it to us at home.  Do this, and you
will be greatly rewarded.

STAN
Woww.

CARTMAN
This... is so cool.

KYLE
Gentlemen, we are OFF!

RANDY
Okay, problem solved.

[Butters' house, moments later. Butters is looking at more of
the video. Steamy action is heard]

WONAN
...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...


BUTTERS
Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down
there?

STAN
We have come to reclaim the one tape!


BUTTERS
Wha, wha, what are you doing?!

KYLE
The Queen and King of Stan's's house
wish the Lord of the Rings returned
to them.

BUTTERS
M-but it's the greatest movie I have
ever seen. You guys were right. Lord
of the Rings IS awesome. Eh, you have
to let me finish watching it.

CARTMAN
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought
back to Stan's's house!

[Butters' house, outside.]

BUTTERS
BWAAAGH!

KYLE
Butters! We said you can't watch it!
We have a quest!

BUTTERS
Well then, then let me go with you.


KYLE
Okay, fine Butters. But if you're gonna
hang out with us, you have to play like
Lord of the Rings.

BUTTERS
Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,
yeah.

KYLE
Butters, what the hell are you doing?!


BUTTERS
Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh,
oh yeah.

KYLE
Get the hell off me! You're a freak,
Butters! You can't play with us!

BUTTERS
Wah let me have the tape!

STAN
No, we have to return it!

BUTTERS
My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My...
preciousss.

[The woods, night. The boys retrace their steps through the backwoods]


CARTMAN
And so the tape was again retrieved
to be brought back to Stan's's house.


KYLE
This copy of Lord of the Rings made
the young Butters behave quite awfully.


STAN
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange
about it, too.

CARTMAN
Perhaps the one videotape has some power
we have not foreseen.

SIXTH GRADER 1
Well well well! If it isn't Robin Hood
and he Merry Men!

KYLE
Oh, crap, the sixth graders!

SIXTH GRADER 1
Whatcha got there?

STAN
Nothing.  Hey kid!

SIXTH GRADER 1
Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's
gay!

CARTMAN
You're gay!

SIXTH GRADER 1
What the?  Whoa!  Check it out, you
guys!

STAN
Give it back! We're on a quest to return
it to my parents!

SIXTH GRADER 1
No way! We're keepin' this and watchin'
it ourselves!

KYLE
You can't keep it.

SIXTH GRADER 1
And what are three little fourth graders
gonna do about it, huh?!

STAN
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is
still trapped in Cartman's body!

CARTMAN
Yeah!

SIXTH GRADER 1
Oh man, I can't wait to see this!

KYLE
Dude, that video is making people act
strange.

CARTMAN
The one tape must be returned!  Run!


SIXTH GRADER 1
Get 'em!

[Butters' house. The Marshes have arrived, and Randy knocks on
the door. Chris answers the door again]

CHRIS
Oh, hello Randy, Sharon.

RANDY
Uh Chris, are the boys over here?

LINDA
No, just Butters. He's been watching
the Lord of the Rings downstairs.


SHARON
Oh dear!

CHRIS
What's the matter?

RANDY
We...  well, this is really sort of
funny, but uh, we, we accidently put
a... porno in the Lord of the Rings
box.

LINDA
Ohh Godd!!

[Butters' basement. The adults enter. The TV is still on, but
there's no picture. Butters isn't around]

CHRIS
Butters?

LINDA
Butters?  Butters!

BUTTERS
The preciousss?  Could you bring back
my preciousss?

CHRIS
Butters, where is the movie you were
watching?

BUTTERS
They took his precious, took it away
to watch without him.  He was really
enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.


RANDY
The boys must've come and saw what it
was and... then taken it away somewhere.


SHARON
Oh no.

[The woods, later. The camera moves from a clearing to a tree
with a large root shading a pocket underneath. The boys come
into view]

KYLE
We can't let those sixth graders get
their hands on this videotape.

CARTMAN
I must say I agree. If this copy of
the Lord of the Rings is tainted, it
would not be safe in the wrong hands.


SIXTH GRADER 1
I smell fourth graders!

STAN
Oh crap, dude!

KYLE
Hide!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Hey.  I think I see something down
the hill.

STAN
Ogh.

KYLE
Phew. The one videotape is sought after
indeed.

STAN
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth
graders.

CARTMAN
Come, guys. We must bring this all
to the attention of the High Elf of
Paragon.

KYLE
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what
to do.

[Kyle's house, night. The boys' parents are all gathered in the
living room.]

RANDY
And so that's the situation. All the
boys are out there somewhere with a...
pornographic videotape.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh God, this, this is horrible!

KYLE'S FATHER
All right, calm down. Now, just how
bad of a porno tape are we talking here?
I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?


RANDY
I'm a...fraid it was... Back Door Sluts
9.

GERALD, CHRIS
Back Door Sluts 9???

LINDA
Is that bad?

CHRIS
Back Door Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers
3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!

KYLE'S FATHER
Ih, it is the single most vile, twisted,
dark piece of porn ever made.

KYLE'S MOTHER
How the hell do you know?!

KYLE'S FATHER
I, uh, I I I read about it in People.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, this is just great! How could you
two be so careless?!

SHARON
We're sorry.

LIANE
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys
forever from these things. Maybe it's
okay for them to see an adult film.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Not without their parents to put it
in a proper context! They won't understand
what they're seeing!

RANDY
It it can't hurt 'em that much, can
it?

BUTTERS
Preciousss.  Let me see my preciousss.
Plee-ee-ee-ease!

[Stan, Kyle, and Cartman arrive at a house. Stan rings the doorbell
twice, but no answer.]

CARTMAN
Open.  Bellog.

CLYDE
What do you guys want?

STAN
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.


CLYDE
Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles
you?

KYLE
We have in our possession something
of great power.  It is... the Lord of
the Rings.

CLYDE
So? I have three copies. And the DVD
with twelve hours of extra footage.


STAN
Yes, but this is not a-  Wow, twelve
hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal
copy. It's making people act really
strange.

CARTMAN
We're seriously, High Elf. Something
very evil lurks in this tape.

CLYDE
Very well, I shall call the council
together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering
behind Talangar the Black's house. And
don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll
get in trouble.

CARTMAN
Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.

CLYDE
Faragon, asshole!

CARTMAN
Clyde's a dick.

[A parking lot in town, night. A bunch of kids are gathered there
on their bikes. The lead sixth graders hops onto a car and gets
the others' attention.]

SIXTH GRADER 1
Alright, everybody listen up! There's
three snot-nosed little fourth graders
out there who have a porno called Back
Door Sluts 9.

OTHER SIXTH GRADERS
Oooooo!

SIXTH GRADER 1
I checked it out on the Internet, and
it said that Back Door Sluts 9 is thee
most hard-core porno ever made!

OTHER SIXTH GRADERS
Ahhhhh!

SIXTH GRADER 1
I have amassed this army of sixth graders
to get the tape by any means necessary!
Now, let's go get that porno!!

[Token's mansion, backyard, night. Very leafy backyard indeed.
The camera moves from a shot of the moon to a shot of all the
fourth grade boys seated around a small table.]

CLYDE
And so that is the situation. The video
may or may not have evil power. Kyle,
would you bring it up here, please?


OTHER BOYS
Ahhh.

JIMMY
That video could have been made by Sauron's
evil f- ...forces.

CRAIG
It could hold a mental spell of some
kind.

KEVIN
Perhaps we could use it to strengthen
our star cruisers.

CARTMAN
Kevin, God-damnit!

CLYDE
Look, until we see this tape's power
for ourselves, we cannot risk giving
it to anybody.

STAN
But if we watch it, we could fall under
its spell, too.

CLYDE
That is true. Only a Paladin with a
high constitution should watch the tape.
Therefore, I think it is a job for you,
Talangar the Black.

TOKEN
I am not scared. I'll go inside and
watch the tape,  just for a few seconds.
If I do not return in two minutes, send
a party in after me.  The fate of Middle
Earth... is in my hands.

[The neighborhood. The sixth graders come into view on their
bicycles making all sorts of noise]

SIXTH GRADER 1
Fourth graders! Give us that porno!


SHARON
Boys?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Boys, we're not mad at you. We just
wanna talk to you.

[Token's mansion, backyard. The boys wait for Token's verdict]


CARTMAN
Talangar the Black returns from watching
the video.

CLYDE
What vice did you see on the videotape,
Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's
magic?

TOKEN
I'm not playing anymore.

STAN
Uh well wait, what'd you see?

TOKEN
I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm
out.

CARTMAN
My God, this thing must really be powerful.


KYLE
This tape makes people freak out wherever
it goes.

STAN
What do we do with it?

CLYDE
One thing for sure, this tape cannot
be trusted with anybody. This must be
returned to the video store from whence
it came.

JIMMY
Well where is the videotape rented from?


KYLE
Two Towers Video Store. Ih in Conifer.


TWEEK
Conifer?? Walking there would take hours!


CLYDE
There's no alternative. We have to return
the tape before it causes more damage!


KINDERGARTNER
I'll go.

CLYDE
Ha! We cannot trust something of that
much power to a dwarf! Especially a
kindergartner dwarf.

CRAIG
You're too young.

CARTMAN
Quiet!

JIMMY
You guys, this is stupid.

CARTMAN
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!


STAN
I will take it!  I will walk to the
video store.

CLYDE
It is too far and too dangerous to go
alone. Take with you the wizard , the
dwarf , the warrior , the cleric , and
the Jew .

KYLE
Paladin!

CLYDE
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship
of the Lord of the Rings. Good luck.
I have to go home now before I get in
trouble.

TWEEK
Me too.

OTHER BOYS
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

CRAIG
Only the six of us are to go?

STAN
No no, there's seven of us. Kenny's
soul is still trapped in Cartman's body,
remember?

CARTMAN
Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's
body is big enough for the both of us.
Shut up, Kenny.

[Kenosha Pass, snowing. The boys walk along the highway through
the pass]

NARRATOR
So it was that the heroes traveled many
miles to return the Lord of the Rings
to the video store.

KYLE
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount
Ururalak.

CRAIG
Look out!

KYLE
We were almost killed.

CARTMAN
A dark wizard must be trying to stop
us!

STAN
True. Someone or something doesn't want
this video returned to the video store.


[Token's mansion. The boys' parents are at the front door. The
front door opens and Token's parents appear]

TOKEN'S FATHER
Oh. Hello everybody.

KYLE'S FATHER
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of
the kids were over here a little while
ago.

TOKEN'S MOTHER
Well yes, I believe they were, but they've
gone. What's the matter?

RANDY
We think our boys might be showing other
chiildren a, uh, ...pornographic tape.


STEVE
Wha? But Token's never seen a porno
before. He wouldn't know what to- Oh
God!

TOKEN'S MOTHER
Token!

[The dining room table. Token sits alone on one of the many seats
there. The adults arrive]

TOKEN'S MOTHER
Token? Did the boys come over and..
show you a movie?

STEVE
Token?  Alright, Token. We know you
must be very confused about what you
saw.

RANDY
Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was
called a pornographic film uh, ih it
shows adult men and adult women having
sexual intercourse.  Well, ya, you see,
when a, when a man and a woman fall
in love, the the man puts his penis
in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making,
and it's part of being in love.

TOKEN
...And when the woman has four penises
in her at the same time, then stands
over the men and pees on them, is that
part of being in love too?  Five midgets,
spanking a man... covered in Thousand
Island dressing. Is that making love?


STEVE
Jesus, what kind of porno is that??


KYLE'S FATHER
It was Back Door Sluts 9.

STEVE
Oh, Jesus, not that one!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as
confused and scared as this poor kid.


KYLE'S FATHER
Uh Token, this is very important: do
you know where the boys went with the
naughty tape?

[Bailey town limit. The boys arrive there]

CRAIG
We're entering the limits of Bailey.
Everyone stay close.

STAN
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey
is about.

KINDERGARTNER
Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.


CARTMAN
Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and
take his bounty of treasure!  For that
is the way of the-

BOY 1
I shall put the magic spell on you!


BOY 2
I have blocked your spell, wizard!


KYLE
Hey, what are you guys doing?

BOY 3
We're playing Harry Potter.

CARTMAN
HA!! Fags!!

KYLE
You guys. Somebody is following us.


CARTMAN
It's Butters.

KYLE
Butters?

CARTMAN
Yes. He's been following us for like
two hours.

BUTTERS
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters
see it.

CARTMAN
Just ignore him - maybe he'll go away.


JIMMY
Hey fellas, mind if we take a little
re-rest?

CARTMAN
There's no time for rest, sorcerer!
Keep up!

JIMMY
They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.


KYLE
Jimmy, are you sure?

JIMMY
Go!  You shall not! ...pah? You shall
not! puh.  You shall not paah.  You
shall not pa-!  You shall not paah!
You shall not puh-uh-uh  You shall
not pass.

[A river, further along the quest. Stan looks back to see about
Jimmy.]

STAN
Jimmy didn't stop them!

KYLE
They're gonna take the Lord of the Rings
from us.

CARTMAN
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders
can't stand water!

CRAIG
What? That's stupid.

CARTMAN
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig,
and I say sixth graders are opposed
to WATER!

CRAIG
Whatever. I'm going back to play with
the Harry Potter kids.

KINDERGARTNER
Me too.

CARTMAN
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy
Potter!

STAN
Just get across the river! They're coming!


SIXTH GRADER 1
What the hell is wrong with you guys?!
Get the tape!

SIXTH GRADER 4
Dude, I don't wanna get wet.

SIXTH GRADER 5
Yeah, I don't really like the water.


SIXTH GRADER 2
Besides, if our bikes get wet, their
chains'll rust.

SIXTH GRADER 1
Oh God-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll
find a bridge.

[The woods, later. The boys walk through it]

NARRATOR
The quest continued to return the Lord
of the Rings to the video store.

STAN
Man, we should have never crossed that
stupid river.

KYLE
Yeah. Good job, Wizard Fatass! Now we're
totally lost.

CARTMAN
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad,
we just don't know where we are! That's
what lost means, stupid! Kenny, shut
your Goddamned mouth!!

STAN
This is great! We're in the middle of
nowhere and nobody knows what direction
the video store is in!

BUTTERS
The Butters knowses.

KYLE
Oh brother!

BUTTERS
The video store. Yesss. Not far from
here. We can show you wheres it is.


STAN
Where?!

BUTTERS
First, just let Butters sseee the precious.


KYLE
No Butters. Look what it's done to you.
It's made you even lamer than before.


CARTMAN
If that was possible.

STAN
Tell us how to get to the video store,
Butters, or else we're gonna kick your
ass!

BUTTERS
Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We
will show you the way. Yesss. This way
it is.

[The road. The Marshes and the Broflovskis ride in the Marsh
car, with Randy driving, and Chris drives the Stotch car]

KYLE'S MOTHER
This is awful! I just know with every
passing minute, little Kyle is seeing
more and more depraved sex acts!

KYLE'S FATHER
Well we'll find them. A-and then we'll
try to put what they saw into context.


SHARON
Look! There's one of the boys now!
Jimmy!

RANDY
Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go
with the porno tape??

JIMMY
They're taking it to the vi... the vi...
the vii...

CHRIS
Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of
time.

JIMMY
They took it back to the video s...
the video s...

RANDY
The video sandwich?

CHRIS
The video stockyard.

RANDY
What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?

JIMMY
No, the video suh... the video s...tih...


KYLE'S FATHER
Stinger?

CHRIS
Staples. They went to the video Staples.
Where's that, Jimmy?

JIMMY
N-n-NO, you retards! the video s...tore!


ADULTS
THE VIDEO STORE!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Hurry! Hurry!

RANDY
I know where it is!

[Two Towers video store. The boys arrive out of breath and head
for the front door]

KYLE
Oh no! They're closed!

STAN
Closed??

SIXTH GRADER 1
There they are!

SIXTH GRADER 6
Don't let them turn it back into the
video store!

CARTMAN
We're screwed.

STAN
Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop
the movie in!

KYLE
Finally.  It's over.

BUTTERS
Precious. Must have our precious. Waaah!


KYLE
Butters! No!

BUTTERS
Nows wees hases it!

STAN
They're coming!

KYLE
It has to go back!

BUTTERS
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.


SIXTH GRADER 1
There it is! Give me that tape!

KYLE
Let go of the tape, Butters!

BUTTERS
I'll never let go!

KYLE
Fine!

BUTTERS
Precious!

SIXTH GRADER 1
Nooo!  No nooo!  Damnit!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Aw man, now we'll never see the hot
action.

SIXTH GRADER 1
You stupid little fourth graders!

CARTMAN
The tape is returned to which it came.
Its power over you shall fade as well.


KYLE
Middle Earth is again safe.

SIXTH GRADER 1
Yeah? Well that's not gonna stop us
from kicking your asses!

STAN
Uh oh.

[the lead sixth grader approaches punching his left fist into
his right hand. The other sixth graders move in alowly. Headlights
appear and a car horn sounds. The sixth graders look at the cars,
as do the boys. The cars pull to a stop short of the boys]


RANDY
Boys! Boys!

SIXTH GRADER 1
Crap! Parents!  Come on, guys.  We'll
see you next time, fourthies!

CARTMAN
And perhaps they would. But for now
the sixth grader army was defeated.


RANDY
There you are!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh Kyle! You're safe!

STAN
Oh hey guys, uh. We were just about
to come home. We had to return the video.


RANDY
A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's
some things we need to put into context
for you. You see, a man puts his penis
into a woman's vagina for both love
and pleasure. But sometimes the woman
lays on top of the man facing the other
way so that they can put each other's
genitals in their mouths.  Uh this is
called "sixty-nining" and it's normal.


SHARON
See boys, a woman is sensitive in her
vagina and it... feels good to have
a man's penis inside of it.

KYLE'S MOTHER
That's right, but sometimes a woman
chooses to use other things. Telephones,
staplers, magazines. It's because the
nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive,
it's like a fun tickle.

KYLE'S FATHER
Now, on to double penetration, boys.
You see, sometimes when a woman has
sex with more than one man, each man
makes love to a different orifice.


RANDY
That's right. It's something adults
can do with really good friends in a
comfortable setting.

KYLE'S MOTHER
It's also important that you understand
why some people choose to urinate on
each other.

RANDY
Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover
is something people might do, but you
must make sure your partner is okay
with it before you start doing it.


KYLE'S FATHER
Okay boys. Do you have any questions?


STAN
...Wwow.

RANDY
Well, let's all get going.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home.


CHRIS
Wait a minute. Where's Butters?

[Two Towers video store, inside the bin behind the drop box.]


BUTTERS
Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Preciouseses!
Preciouseses!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 417


"A VERY CRAPPY CHRISTMAS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Kyle's house, night. The Happy Chanukah sign is up and it is
snowing.]

[Kyle's house, night, bathroom. The toilet is seen and on it
are a glass and a plate of chocolate-chip cookies. Kyle sits
in his pajamas underneath a window and next to a night stand
and candle opposite the toilet bowl, and holding a small flag
which reads,

WELCOME

MR. HANKEY

Ike walks in and towards the food]

KYLE
He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.


IKE
Oooh nooo, poopies.

KYLE
Heee might not come if you're too close
to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by
me.

KYLE'S MOTHER
It's getting late, boys. Why don't
you come on up to bed.

KYLE
Just let us stay up a little longer,
mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He
always does.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Alright, bubbe.  Oh, and boys? Happy
Chanukah.

KYLE
Happy Chanukah, Mom.

[Kyle's house, night, bathroom. "Silent Night" plays]

IKE
Ayaaa ta.  Weee! Weee...

KYLE
Go away!

[The ant scurries away. At length, the candle burns down to the
plate and goes out. Kyle and Ike are both asleep. Sheila and
Gerald look in once again and find the boys asleep. Sheila picks
up Ike and Gerald picks up Kyle and take them to their respective
rooms. Kyle is then seen asleep in his room. He opens and blinks
his eyes, then gasps and sits up. He rushes out of bed and into
the restroom, only to find an empty plate and glass. He thinks
Mr. Hankey has been by, until he notices something on the floor
to the left of the toilet. A look of dismay comes over his face.
It's the ant he sees, now bloated and content. Kyle goes to make
a phone call.]

[Stan's house, night, bathroom. "Silent Night" continues]

STAN
A-ah huh.

KYLE
Stan! Go get the other guys and tell
them to meet me at the bos stop in ten
minutes!

STAN
Ho-o-oh.

[South Park, night, bus stop. Kyle, with flashlight and crow
bar, is waiting as the others arrive. Kenny arrives in coat,
hood, and undies. Cartman in pajamas, cap and coat, and Stan
fully dressed, but with his cap askew. A lock of hair is seen]


KYLE
Okay, good. You're all here.

STAN
What is this all about, Kyle?

KYLE
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up
yet.

CARTMAN
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to
bed.

KYLE
It's only three days until Christmas,
you guys! You know how bad thins have
been around here. I think it might be
because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.

CARTMAN
Kyle, I have a full day of watching
TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go
on a poo hunt right now, okay?

KYLE
If you guys want thre to be a Christmas,
you'd better come help me!

[South Park, night, city streets. Snow is still falling, but
a manhole cover has been lifted and set aside. Down below, in
the sewer, the boys walk in the muck looking for Mr. Hankey's
home]

CARTMAN
Heh-tchoo!

KYLE
Dude, you sneezed on my back!

CARTMAN
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs
while you're walking around in human
feces!

KYLE
Hey, look.  Hello?

MR. HANKEY
Hoowwddyy ho!

KYLE
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried!
I was weiting up for you and you didn't
come, so I thought that-

MR. HANKEY
Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle.

KYLE
But where have you been? Things aren't
the same without you. Nobody seems to
have the Christmas spirit.

MR. HANKEY
I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully
busy with my family.  Honey!

CARTMAN
Family?

MR. HANKEY
Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.


AUTUMN
Howdy-hey kids!  Would you like a drink?


MR. HANKEY
They're too young to drink, honey.


AUTUMN
Hey haa, it's Christmas!

MR. HANKEY
Come. You have to meet the little nuggets,
too. Kids!  This is our son, Cornwallis.


CORNWALLIS
Hoowwdy Ho!

MR. HANKEY
Our daughter Amber.

AMBER
Hoowwdy Ho!

MR. HANKEY
And our son, Simon.

SIIMON
Eee, hey! Hnhn.

MR. HANKEY
Simon's not so smart. He was born with
a peanut in his head.

SIIMON
Heh What? Dad? Huh?

MR. HANKEY
Nothin', Simon.

KYLE
A family! So THAT's why you haven't
been able to spread Christmas cheer.


MR. HANKEY
It sure has been tough. Nobody seems
that into Christmas out there.

STAN
I know, it's like it doesn't matter
anymore.

CARTMAN
My mom''s barely bought me any presents
so far.

MR. HANKEY
Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the
nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas
cheer!  And if you want, you can help
them.

KYLE
Sure we'll help!

CARTMAN
Anything for more presents!

AUTUMN
"Hic" Weh-hell, it's a Chrstmas party!
Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me
I won't take off my clothes?

MR. HANKEY
Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?


AUTUMN
but it's a Chrstmas party!

MR. HANKEY
Honey, can we go inside for a second?
Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow
we're gonna bring back the spirit of
Christmas!

[South Park, day, city streets. The boys and the nuggets stand
on the sidewalk in front of Tele's and the toy store humming
"Good King Wencelas" The nuggets soon hum their own tunes. Stan,
Kyle, and Kenny wear nose clips and suits that suggest they are
reindeer, while Cartman is dressed as Santa]

CARTMAN
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys!
Only three shopping days until-  God-damnit!
Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole!

STAN
Nobody's paying any attention.

WOMAN
Ew, I almost stepped in it.

TELE'S OWNER
Well, it was a good effort, boys. But
I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's
buyin' anything an' I can't afford to
keep this furnace runnin'!  Oh. And,
boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk
there. Watch out.

RED
Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's
content to celebrate with candles and
love.

STAN
This is hopeless. We're just gonna
have to face that the commercialism
has been sucked out of Christmas.


[A special report. Behind the anchor is a "No Christmas Trees"
sign]

NEWS ANCHOR
And in other news tonight it appears
that everyone is officially SICK OF
CHRISTMAS!  In an SPC poll, 38% said
they were fred up and tired of the holiday,
5% said they were indifferent to it,
and a whopping 57% they would quick
Bon Jovi square in the balls if given
the opportunity.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Well, I think people are just fed up
with the crowded shopping and the credit-card
bills, uh.  I, I think that the holiday
just has become a joke.

MAN
You know, it's just that a lot of people
don't really believe in the whole Jesus
thing anymore, you know? So what's to
celebrate?

MAN 2
Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right
square in the balls.

NEWS ANCHOR
Well, the holiday spirit may be gone
from South Park, but at least our faith
in each other remains strong.

ASSISTANT
In South Park.

NEWS ANCHOR
Oh really?

[South Park, Cartman's house, day. The report is over]

STAN
Dude, change the channel. This is too
depressing.

CHARLIE BROWN
Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree
for our play.

CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.

STAN
How come everyone in cartoons has such
big heads?

CHARLIE
Alright, everyone, we've got to get
on with our play!

KYLE
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin'
is dancing around!

CARTMAN
Yeah, this thing really falls apart
in the second act.

STAN
And why is it that on Charlie Brown
cartoons, everyone talks like this.


CARTMAN
My mom could make a better Christmas
special than this!

KYLE
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally
it!  It's so simple!

STAN
What, dude?

KYLE
We can get everyone back into the Christmas
spirit by making our very own animated
Christmas special, and showing it to
everybody in town!

STAN
We don't know anything about animation.


KYLE
How hard can it be? Look at it.

CARTMAN
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated
Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star
us instead of these little round-headed
guys!

KENNY
(Yeah, right! Awesome!)

STAN
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit
of Christmas"

[South Park, The Mayor's office, day. The report is over]

MAYOR
Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our
whole town's economy is going right
in the toilet! We've got to get everybody
back in the Christmas spirit!

AIDE 2
Mayor, some adorable children are here
to see you.

MAYOR
Meugh. Send them in.

KYLE
Mayor! We have the solution to your
problem.

MAYOR
You do?

KYLE
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas
card that everyone can watch and and
play it on the screen at the old drive-in.


STAN
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa.
And when people see it, they'll just
HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need
is three hundred dollars for our budget.


MAYOR
An animated Christmas card. Kids, that
just may be the dumbest idea I've ever
heard, ever!

THE BOYS
Awww.

MAYOR
But at this point I'm willing to try
anything. Johnson, cut them a check
for three hundred dollars.

THE BOYS
Alright!

KYLE
You guys go tell Butters to start making
the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr.
Hankey the good news!

[The Hankey home, day, exterior. Mr. Hankey and Autumn are in
a heated argument inside. The argument is incomprehensible for
a while, until a voice stands out.]

MR. HANKEY
Now you put that vase down! Put that
vase down! That's a very expensive vase!
Don't you throw that vase!

KYLE
Ah, Mr. Hankey?

MR. HANKEY
Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!

KYLE
We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're
gonna make our animated Christmas card.


Oh, that's swell! Kids! [the nuggets come out] Christmas is back
on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again.


THE NUGGETS
Okay!

AUTUMN
That's not the only thing we gotta get
workin' again,  if you know what I mean...


MR. HANKEY
Wha- why do you, why do you have to
say things like that in front of people?


KYLE
Well, I've gotta go start our animation.
We've only got two days.

MR. HANKEY
Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that
projector workin'! Don't you worry!


AMBER
What's the matter, Cornwallis?

[Butters' home, day. A gate is open by one side of the house.
Inside, the four boys enter a room littered with cutouts]

KYLE
Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've
got.

BUTTERS
Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect
too much with the budget you gave me.


STAN
Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!


BUTTERS
Well, alright. Here's a little paper
construction of Santa Claus.  "Ho ho
ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you
like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and
uh, here's a little Jesus.  "Hi there,
Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and
stuff."  "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good,
I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout
versions of you guys.

THE BOYS
Whoa!

CARTMAN
Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.


STAN
That's not me, that's you!

CARTMAN
What?!

KYLE
They kind of look like us.  I mean,
Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a
sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda
look like us.

CARTMAN
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT!

KYLE
God job, Butters.

BUTTERS
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout
version of me, too! Ih in case you need
it for your animated film.

STAN
No, that's okay.

KYLE
See ya!

BUTTERS
Uh-m, alright, alright then.  "Oh, uh,
hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"
"Huh, Butters, ma'am."  "Well, Butters,
would you like to slap my- titties around?"
"Whoa! Well, uhuh"  "Uh, no thanks,
ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again."


[The Hankey home, day. Inside, Cornwallis is seated at a table
with thumb tacks for legs. There are two 5-book stacks on the
table, a third stack on the floor behnd him, and two books on
the floor in front of the table. Mr. Hankey enters, and soon
seen are a spool of string for a bedstand and a pencil as a curtain
rod. A locket hangs over Cornawallis' bed, and it contains pictures
of his parents]

MR. HANKEY
Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the
drive-in.

CORNWALLIS
I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad.


MR. HANKEY
Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The
boys' animated movie will being back
the spirit of Christmas.

CORNWALLIS
It's not that, father. Its... Well,
I don't feel like I'm really a part
of Christmas.

MR. HANKEY
But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!


AUTUMN
Come on, it's time to sit around the
tree!

MR. HANKEY
We're having a talk, honey.

AUTUMN
God-damnit it's Christmas and we're
gonna be a happy family around the tree!


MR. HANKEY
Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now,
just go help the other kids; they can't
get their stockings up.

AUTUMN
That's not the only thing that can't
get up around here.

MR. HANKEY
...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.


CORNWALLIS
Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas
isn't for us.

MR. HANKEY
Christmas is about feeling good. That's
for everybody!

CORNWALLIS
I see the Nativity. There's angels,
shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All
the Christmas movies: Santa, elves,
reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of
it.

MR. HANKEY
No, you're not a part of it, Carnwallis.
You're all of it. Don't you see?

CORNWALLIS
I'm nothing but crap!

MR. HANKEY
But crap is everything.

Everything that lives on earth poos in some way

And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day

[Takes Cornwallis out and up to the street]

Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky


[cows graze on the some exposed grass while large birds fly lazily
above]

It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

'Cause it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men


[A cow poops as it eats, then Butters' family is shown eatng
burgers at table]

It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again

[Mr. Jankey sings to Cornwallis, then Butters' father is shown
straining on the toilet]

And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the
sea.

[some poo descends through the pipe, and Mr. Hankey soon follows.
A raw sewage outlet is then shown with Mr. Hankey exiting]


And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.


[plankton swarm the poo and devour it; a small fish eats the
plankton]

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside

[a bigger fish eats the small fish, but an even bigger one approaches]


Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive

[the bigger fish swallows the medium-sized one and swims up to
the surface, only to be snatched up by a bear]

By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand

[the bear walks off with the fish in its mouth and poos as he
leaves]

So it can spring to life and become food for the land

[flowers and grass spring up through and around it. The camera
pulls back to reveal an African savvannah around the flowers,
with all sorts of animals in it]

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe

[soft backup vocals come on, lending the song an African feel.
antelope run in the background as a giraffe appears and stops]


It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass

[The camera looks at Mr. Hankey and Cornwallis atop Poo Rock,
first from the back, then from the front]

The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end


[more cattle are shown grazing and pooing]

To make food for the humans and start all over again

[a man scoops the poo into a small bag and walks off; Butters
and family eat more burgers; his mom sits on the toilet]


[back on Poo Rock, before which animals poo freely] You see,
son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.


CORNWALLIS
But how can I be that giraffe and blade
of grass, and a human? I don't control
what they do.

MR. HANKEY
Just like your heart beats without
you thinking about it, so, too, your
giraffes and your humans do what they
do without you even thinkin' about it.
But it is all one life form. It is all...
you.

CORNWALLIS
I think I see now.

I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground

[steps forward]

MR. HANKEY
Becomes the grass of tomorrow

CORNWALLIS
Yeah

MR. HANKEY
Which the grazers turn around

[An antelope stops to poo a little, then runs off to join the
others]

CORNWALLIS
So I'm the leg of a leopard and the
wings of a hen

[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with
the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]

That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!

[Blink to black]

[Stan's house, basement, day. He hands out scripts to the other
three boys]

STAN
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't
have an ending.

KYLE
No ending? Well, we can't animate until
we have our voices recorded, so we'd
better just record what we have and
figure out the ending later.

SOUND MAN
Okay, talk directly in the mike and
don't hit any hard p's.

KYLE
What's a hard p?

CARTMAN
You know, first thing in the mornng
when it just won't come out?

KYLE
Oh, yeah.

SOUND MAN
Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and...


THE BOYS
We wish you a Merry Christmas

SOUND MAN
Hold on.

KYLE
We wish-

THE BOYS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

CARTMAN
...deh.OOOWW!!!

SOUND MAN
Uh,  mmm. Okay, and?

BOYS
We wish you a merry Christmas,

We wish you a merry Christmas,

We wish you a merry Christmas--

STAN
Hey! Wait a minute!

KYLE
What?

STAN
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

KYLE
Well, yes, I think so.

STAN
Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate
Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah
songs.

KYLE
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,

I made you out of clay,

Dreidel dreidel dreidel--

CARTMAN
Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.

KYLE
Don't you oppress me, fat boy.

CARTMAN
Don't call me fat, buttfucker.

KYLE
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin'
fatass!

STAN
You guys, knock it off! We have to record
this!

SOUND MAN
Dude, that was awesome.

STAN
What's awesome?

SOUND MAN
The script. It's sweet.

STAN
That's not in the script They do this
all the time.

SOUND MAN
Well, it should be in the script. All
that "you're fat" and "you're a Jew"
and stuff. It's great.

[South Park, Photo Dojo, day. The boys are gathered round a camera,
which is pointing straight down onto the poster Butters made
for them. Two lights shine on the poster, and the cutouts are
in place. Some other heads are at the top end of the poster]


KYLE
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots
one frame at a time. So, all we gotta
do, is put the right mouth on, according
to what syllable they're pronouncing
at that frame.

STAN
Easy.

KYLE
Yeah. So what's the first syllable?


STAN
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas


KYLE
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths
on all our heads.  And then we shoot
that for one frame.

STAN
Okay.  One.

KYLE
That's one twenty-fourth of a second
of our movie already shot!

STAN
Kickass!

KYLE
Now, the next mouth.

STAN
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas.


KYLE
Okay, where are the E-mouths?

STAN
E mouths...

[South Park, Photo Dojo, three hours later. The boys' eyelids
are drooping andthey're tired]

KYLE
Okay. "Woo" mouths again?

STAN
1  2.

KYLE
So how much done is that?

STAN
"We wish you a m- Merry"

KYLE
Aw,  Jesus Christ!

[South Park Dirve-In, night. The boys' eyelids are drooping andthey're
tired]

MAYOR
This kids better make a good Christmas
movie, Johnson. If people in this town
don't start shopping again, we're all
gonna be out of jobs next year.

JOHNSON
This... place is pretty run-down.

MAYOR
It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew
coming.

MR. HANKEY
Hoowwddy ho!  Down here!

JOHNSON
WAAGGH!

MAYOR
Oh. Mr. Haneky, it's you. How wonderful.


MR. HANKEY
My family and I are here to get the
drive-in ready for the biig movie.


AUTUMN
Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person.
*hic*  You wanna bet me I won't take
off my clothes and run naked through
this parkin' lot?

MR. HANKEY
Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!


AUTUMN
I didn't start it! He was looking at
my breasts!

MR. HANKEY
They're not real, you know.

AUTUMN
Don't you say that!

MR. HANKEY
Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're
made of silicorn!

JOHNSON
Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup.


MR. HANKEY
Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure
needs a lot of work.

CORNWALIS
We can fix it up, Dad.

AMBER
Oh, look! A homeless person.  Oh. He
looks sad, Pappa.  There. That's better.


MR. HANKEY
Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting
to look Christmasy

[South Park, Photo Dojo, next day. The boys are back at the animatic
further along in the project]

KYLE
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set
up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames.


STAN
AAAAAAAA!

KYLE
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!

STAN
That took us half an hour to set up,
fatass!

CARTMAN
Alright! You know what? I have been
here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this
stupid cartoon, and we're never goin'
to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys,
I'm goin' home!

KYLE
Fine! We'll do it with out you!

STAN
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've
already animated him in it!

KYLE
We'll dub his voice over.

STAN
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got
20 seconds of animation done, and we
still have Jesus' and Santa's voices
to record, and we don't even have a
third act. Dude, it would take a miracle
to finish this thing!

KYLE
Now, don't go saying that. There's always
hope.

Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.

But don't expect a miracle.

Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry.

[takes the poster and rolls it up.]

You pray, and I'll plan

[The boys exit the Photo Dojo with it]

We'll do what's necessary, 'cause

[now in Stan's room, works on a Brian Boitano cutout]

Even a miracle needs a hand!

[walks up to the wall and adds a scene to Act II]

KYLE
You love-

STAN
We love

KYLE
-And I'll labor.

STAN
Tralala

KYLE
You sit-

STAN
We sit.

KYLE
-And I'll stand.

STAN
Tralalalala

BOYS
Get help from our next-door neighbor,
'cause

[Kenny begins to hum as the Hankey family is shown cleaning up
the drive-in]

BOYS, HANKEYS
Even a miracle needs a hand!

[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr.
Hankey cleans up]

[Stan's house, basement, day. Stan and Kyle have to work without
Cartman, so they stand wearing headphones and reading the script
aloud]

KYLE
You could do Cartman's voice, can't
you?

STAN
"Awgh! I'm so fat!"

KYLE
Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.

STAN
"Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so
fat! Help me out over hmyah!"

KYLE
Cool! Now let's try the script!

SOUND MAN
Rolling...

STAN


STAN
I don't know what to do, dude. Who should
we help?

CARTMAN
I say we help Santa Claus!

KYLE
Oh, you're just saying that because
he brings you candy.

STAN
Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that
kind of shit from a Jew!

[Stan's house, living room, day. Kyle and Stan resume singing
as Kyle packs the cutouts into a box headed for Korea]

KYLE
You wish-

STAN
We wish

KYLE
-And I'll whittle.

STAN
Tralalalala

KYLE
You sit-

STAN
We sit.

KYLE
-And I'll stand.

STAN
Tralalalala

KYLE
Let's all try to help a little, 'cause


[A group of 20 Korean inbetweeners are shown working hard on
the short]

[South Park, Potter's Art Store, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk
out with construction paper]

BOYS
Even a miracle-

[a car comes in and runs over Kenny as the diriver honks, leaving
Kenny flat as a pancake. The boys just look in wonder]

STAN
...It's okay. We'll just have his character
die in the film.

[Stan's house, living room, day. Stan and Kyle are there. A large
box has come for Stan and he's about to open it]

STAN, KYLE
Even a miracle____ needs____ a____ hand!!


[South Park Drive-In, night. The drive-in is cleaned up now.
The entire town shows up to see the short film. To the left,
two klieg lights shine on a high platfom on which stand the Mayor
and her aides; Stan, Kyle, and Cartman. A decorated Christmas
tree stands behind them. On close-up, though, Cartman is missing]


MAYOR
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado
Film Commission is pleased to present
to you a work by some of our very own
South Park children.

CARTMAN
Thank you, thank you.

KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing
here?! You quit!

CARTMAN
What are you talkin' about, "quit"?
Huh! I don't remember that.

MAYOR
We know tha after you see this darling
short film,  you will all feel the mighty
glow of the Christmas spirit once again.
Boys?

KYLE
Okay, Mr. Hankey!

MR. HANKEY
O-kay!

[SCENE
a snowy hill. South Park comes into
view. A squirrel pops up to see the
camera, then drops away next to the
town sign. Kids can be heard singing
a Christmas carol. The camera pans to
the right]

KIDS
We wish you a merry Christmas,

We wish you a merry Christmas,

We wish you a merry Christmas--

STAN
Hey! Wait a minute!

KYLE
What?

STAN
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?

KYLE
Yeah, I think so.

STAN
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't
celebrate Christmas!

KYLE
What?

STAN
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!


KYLE
Dreidel dreidel dreidel-

[the film snaps in two and grinds to a halt. Fear strikes the
boys' faces, then the Mayor's face. The film spools out of the
reels and Mr. Hankey holds the unwound film in his hands]

SIMON
Eehhhh, pretty!

MAN
Oh, that's Christmas for ya.

MAYOR
Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to
be having some technical difficulties


MAN 2
Boring.

MAN 3
I've gotta go.

MAN 4
Stupid.

MR. HANKEY
It's completely destroyed! There's
nothn' I can do!

KYLE
All that hard work.

MAYOR
Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea
you had there. Now everyone is more
disenfranchised with Christmas than
ever. We want our three hundred bucks
back!

KYLE
But we spent it!

MAYOR
Fine. Then we'll sue you.  Johnson?


AIDE
I... used to believe in miracles.

KYLE
All that work!

STAN
For nothing.

MR. HANKEY
Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry.

KYLE
Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.

CARTMAN
I guess- we might as well- go home now.


[The Hankey home, night. Inside, Mr. Hankey sits on the little
sofa. Cornwallis hops up to him and joins him on the sofa]


MR. HANKEY
It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's
hopes up.

CORNWALLIS
But Dad, we can fix the projector.


MR. HANKEY
Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone'
gone home. And I don't know nothin'
about projectors. I'm just a stupid
piece of crap.

CORNWALLIS
Dad, you taught me an important lesson:
That crap is the cycle of everything.


MR. HANKEY
Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis!
I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop
your bitchin'

CORNWALLIS
No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because
you showed me that I have the power
and the strength to do anything I want.
You made me believe in myself, Dad!
Now I'm asking you to do the same.


MR. HANKEY
Son...  You're the smartest piece of crap
since Albert Poodinger! Come on!


[The Marsh house, living room, night. The immediate family is
gathered]

SHARON
Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley?
No commercialism and shopping, just
a nice fire and family.

GRANDPA
I wanna die.

[A view of the suburbs. Lights come on all over the neighborhood,
and families begin to come out of their houses. one girl and
her parents, another girl and her parents, a boy and girl and
their parents, etc. The light everyone sees is the drive-in screen.
The short has been repaired and is airing the scene where the
boys first meet Jesus. The drive-in soon fills up]

[On screen, Jesus floats down from the sky.]

KYLE
What the--

KENNY
(Nooo!!)

[The Broflovski house, night. The frontn door opens and Gerald
and Sheila step out with Ike. Kyle follows them out.]

KYLE
They did it! They got it working!


[On screen.]

JESUS
You have blemished the meaning of Christmas
for the last time, Kringle!

SANTA
I bring happiness and love to children
all over the world.

JESUS
Christmas is for celebrating my birth!


SANTA
Christmas is for giving!

[A shot of the audience]

CROWD
Oh, wow!

[The Hankey house. Amber and Simon stand outside]

AMBER
Mom! They got it working!

AUTUMN
What's that? They got your father's
penis workin' again?

[A shot of Stan, Kyle, and Cartman smiling. On screen...]

KYLE
...We actually spoke--to the Brian Boitano.


STAN
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned
something today, it doesn't matter if
you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist
or Hindu. Christmas still is about one
very important thing.

CARTMAN
Yeah, ham.

STAN
No not ham!

[The audience. The boys laugh]

CARTMAN
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say
that?!

KYLE
Heheh, we could make you say whatever
we wanted.

[On screen...]

STAN
...Christmas is about something much
more important!

KYLE
What?

STAN
Presents.

KYLE
Ah.

STAN
Don't you see, Kyle?

KYLE
Yeah.

STAN
Presents.

[The audience...]

VARIOUS FLOK
...Presents.

MAN 5
My God, they're right!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Christmas is about presents. If we all
buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?


RANDY
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism.
Becuase it's what makes our country
work!

MAYOR
They're starting to understand, Johnson.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
We got so caught up in the little things
of Christmas, like love and family that...
we almost fogot it's buying things that
makes our economy thrive.

MAYOR
Hey, the shops are still open. We still
have time to shop.

KYLE
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought
back the spirit of Christmas!

MR. HANKEY
No, you did it, boys!

AUTUMN
Aw, hell, we all did it!

MAYOR
Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How
would you like to have your own show
and make 100 more of them?

STTAN
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather
stab ourselves in the head.

CARTMAN
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our
presents.

KYLE
Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents
for eight days.

STAN
Wow! Count me in!

CARTMAN
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.

BOYS

Episode 512


"HERE COMES THE NEIGHBORHOOD"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. Butters stands in front of the class
witha small volcano - his science experiment.]

BUTTERS
...And so, just like in nature, ah I
can add the mixture into the volcano
and...

O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-

[the belching volcano draws his attention as it coughs up the
"lava"] Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.


BUTTERS
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik!  I got
a check. That's like a C!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay. Whose project should we look at
next? How aboouuut Eric?  Eric Cartman?


CARTMAN
Stand by, please.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
NOW Eric!

CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit!

KYLE
Haha

CARTMAN
Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project,
I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In
this way we see the duality of writing
devices that occur in nature.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
You just put that thing together just
now! I'm giving you a check minus.


CARTMAN
Oh GOD-DAMNIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Siddown

CARTMAN
I'll make you eat your parents!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
What did you say?!

CARTMAN
Nothing!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, Token, you're next.

TOKEN
Using my laptop computer, I hooked into
the Internet and found a meteorology
Web site.  I donwloaded the data, and
with my dad's video projector, I can
show you the graph I made of predictable
weather patterns over the next three
months.

CLYDE
Wwooww.

TOKEN
I also printed out the results on my
color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Very very good, Token. You get a check
plus.

TOKEN
Alright!

CARTMAN
Aw, that is such bullcrap!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, for the love of God.

CARTMAN
No! No, see, this is the fundamental
flaw with the check check-plus check-minus
system! The only reason Token was able
to do all that is because his family
is rich!

TOKEN
My family isn't rich.

CARTMAN
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is
four times the size of anyone else's
in town! And who else gets crab cakes
and, and lobster tail in their lunch
boxes?!

STAN
Your family is rich, dude.

TOKEN
But I...

CARTMAN
Let's just see where Token's clothes
come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani
Exchange!

KYLE
Aharmani Exchange?

CARTMAN
All the rest of us have to buy our clothes
at J mart! Have you even been inside
a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so!


STAN
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they
have their own pool table.

BUTTERS
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system.
You don't think you're rich?

[Token's house, after school. His parents are at the sofa. His
father reads a newspaper; his mother, a book. Token walks in]


LINDA
Hello Token. How was school today?


TOKEN
Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house
than everybody else in South Park?


BOB
Well, because we have more money, son.


TOKEN
I know. But why?

BOB
...W-well, because we went to graduate
school and therefore have more lucrative
jobs than most people in town. For instance,
your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical
company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's
mother is a crack whore. One pays more
than the other.

LINDA
Why, sweetie? What's the matter?

TOKEN
All the kids at school made fun of me
today because I'm rich.

BOB
...Oh.

TOKEN
I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna
eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and,
and and wear clothes from J mart!


LINDA
J mart?

BOB
Son, you, you don't know what you're
saying.

TOKEN
I just wanna be like all the other kids
in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad,
please.

[J mart, later. A small SUV pulls into the J mart lot. Token
takes his first look at J mart. He is awed by it and pleased
at the chance to shop there.]

BOB
You... sure you want to do this, son?


TOKEN
I'm sure.

LINDA
Hmmm...

BOB
Where's the... valet?

LINDA
He must be parkiing someone else's car.


BOB
Ah, here we go.  Take good care of it,
please.  Here's twenty dollars.  Hoh?
They've activated some kind of alien
blinding device.

TOKEN
That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's
flourescent lighting.

BOB
Oh.

LINDA
Excuse me, where can where would we
find young men's fashion apparel?


OBESE WOMAN
Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.

BOB
Next to the-?!

TOKEN
Come on!  Hey look: there pants are
only five bucks apiece. They must really
suck. What do ya think?

LINDA
What, what brand are they?

TOKEN
It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor
people pants.

RANDY
Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?


SHARON
Huh?  Oh. Yeah, it is.  What are they
doing here? They can afford to shop
at Cherry Creek.

LIANE
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses
are shopping here.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I don't get it. He must pull in at least
two hundred thousand a year.

BOB
S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't
think we quite fit n here.

CARTMAN
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue,
Stan. You own me ten million dollars.


TOKEN
Hey you guys.

STAN
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?


CARTMAN
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.


TOKEN
Yeah, well, you know, I did a little
shopping at J mart.

STAN
Alright, well, let's just watch the
Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway.


TOKEN
Here you go.

STAN
What's that?

TOKEN
It's a DVD of the Lion King

STAN
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.

KYLE
Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too
expensive.

CARTMAN
Not too expensive for Token's rich ass
family, apparently.

CRAIG
Don't you have a VHS of it?

TOKEN
I only have this.

CARTMAN
Oh, well, let me take this disk up
to the Enterprise and see if Captain
Kirk can decrypt it.

TOKEN
What's a VHS?

CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus, dude.

STAN
Come on, guys. We'll jsut have to find
other stuff to do.

KYLE
What's a VHS?

[Token looks at the DVD, then at the boys, then at the DVD. He
lets the DVD case fall to the floor on top of the DVD and leaves
the house. Music comes up as he leaves the Marsh house]

TOKEN
Why can't I be like all the other kids?


[sees Kenny and brother Kevin playing on their lawn. Kenny is
flying around getting dizzy while Kevin plays with a deflated
basketball.]

They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.


[hops onto a wooden box and peeks in - he sees Butters eating]


And cut-up hot dogs for lunch

It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.

[leaves the window and walks over to Stark's Pond, then sits
and pulls out a dollar coin from a small collection. The pond
has thawed, and lily pods can be seen on the water. Token tosses
the coin, and it skips across the water. He then walks on and
stops across the street from the South Park Welfare Office. Craig
and his family leave the office with their welfare check as Cartman
and mom walk in.]

There's no one in town I can relate to.

I play with autographed baseball bats

[he fades into a baseball uniform and holds a bat with Barry
Bonds' signature on it]

while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones

[across the street he sees a baseball game, with Kyle pitching,
Cartman catching, Stan at bat, Clyde in left field, and three
other boys. Sticks and cones are being used. Stan hits the cone.
It sails away and Stan rounds the bases]

Has a boy ever felt so alone?

[drops his bat and glove and walks away, then stops and gets
a look of determination.]

Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something
I'm not

[rushes home and goes to his desk to work on something - a 2-page
tabloid ad extolling South Park as the next Aspen]

If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.

If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,


So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.

[he finishes, puts the ad into a sturdy envelope addressed to
Forbes Magazine Department with some bills, and goes to the window
to look at the sunset. Outside, the camera pulls back from the
window]

Please, God, send more rich kids...

To my...

Town

[As the camera pulls back, Token's house is shown to be big indeed,
with a three- or four-car garage set back some distance from
the street. To the right, two more houses appear, but they are
small next to the Williams house.]

[Next shot, a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. An address is shown]


Will Smith

17804 Beverly Estates

Hollywood Hills, CA. 90046

[the camera pulls back to show Smith reading Forbes Magazine]


WILL SMITH
Ooo, look at this, honey.  A beautiful
unspoiled town in the Rockies. This
is just what we've been looking for!


JADA PINKETT SMITH
"Like Aspen was 30 years ago." Sounds
nice.

WILL SMITH
We could buy hundreds of acres of land
for next to nothing! And then I could
finally live like a cowboy.

JADA PINKETT SMITH
Oh Will, the country would be such a
nicer place to raise our kids!

WILL SMITH
O kids?

OLDER BOY
Yes, Daddy?

WILL SMITH
How would you like to move to the Colorado
Rockies?

OLDER BOY
The mountains, Daddy?

GIRL
Can we have horses?

OLDER BOY
O can we? Can we Daddy?

WILL SMITH
You bet!

KIDS
Hooray!

[South Park, soon after, day. A new four-story mansion rises
in a new lot. A crane positions the new fountain in a circular
driveway in front of the mansion. Token grins as he watches the
laborers work. A limosine and a moving truck pull up behind him.
Will Smith and family pour out of the limo]

WILL SMITH
Well, here it is. Our home to be.

JADA PINKETT SMITH
Oh, Will, it's beautiful.

TOKEN
Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!

WILL SMITH
Why thank you, young man. We're the
Smiths.

OLDER BOY
Ah, a local boy. You shall be our nwe
playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my
sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel


TOKEN
I'm Token.

LISA
Our daddy is a very famous actor. What
does your daddy do?

TOKEN
Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.

WILL SMITH
How quaint. Kids, why don't you play
with little Token while your mother
and I check out the town.

FREDERICK
Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us
how to play your mountain games.

TOKEN
All right!  Thanks, God.

[Token's mansion, later. Token leads the Smith kids on a tour
of the mansion]

TOKEN
...And this is the room where my mom
and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh
painting.

FREDERICK
Yes, yes, we have one of those, too.
In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.


TOKEN
You do? God, that's great!

DANIEL
Why?

TOKEN
I'm just so happy you guys moved into
town. You see, I used to be the only
rich kid. All the other families here
are kinda  low to  middle-income.


LISA
Why? What happened to all their money?


TOKEN
Well, they never really had any money.


LISA
Well, then, why don't their daddies
just act in a movie?

TOKEN
Well I... think that.. they...

FREDERICK
Sometimes children must be very firm
with their daddies.

LISA
Indeed.

FREDERICK
Like when Daddy doesn't want to act
in a movie because he thinks the script
is bad.

LISA
So we must plead with him:  "Please,
Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard,
Daddy."

DANIEL
"Please, Daddy, please!"

FREDERICK
"Twenty million is still twelve million
after taxes, Daddy!"

LISA
"I want a llama, Daddy!"

FREDERICK
"I'd do the picture, Daddy!"

LISA
"Please, Daddy!"

FREDERICK
"Daddy, please!"

LISA
"Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!"

DANIEL
"But Daddy!"

FREDERICK
And so Daddy does the picture.

TOKEN
...That's ...great.

LISA
Twenty million dollars great.

[A recording studio. A rapper is laying down some tracks.]

SNOOP DOGG
I found a girl who had an innie and
I felt her with my jimmy

Player-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-

ENGINEER
Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is
on line three for you?

SNOOP DOGG
Oh.  William! How are you buddy?

WILL SMITH
Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?

SNOOP DOGG
Couldn't be better. I'm just laying
down some vocals for my new album.


WILL SMITH
Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember
how we always talked about wanting to
buy property up in the mountains so
our kids could ski and ride horses?


SNOOP DOGG
Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all
the time.

WILL SMITH
Well I found the place, Snooty-roo.
It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered,
laid-back, and beautiful.

SNOOP DOGG
Ogh. It sounds lovely!

WILL SMITH
You really should come give it a look.
Jada and I would love for some friends
to move here with us.

SNOOP DOGG
I certainly will, William. And perhaps
I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant
a call. They've been looking for vacation
properties as well.

WILL SMITH
Great! Well, let me let you get back
to your recording.

SNOOP DOGG
Hah, see you soon. Bye.

WILL SMITH
Bye.

SNOOP DOGG
Alright, let's take it from the top,
gang.

I shout "Hell Yeah!" from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-

[South Park, day. Another rich family moves into town. Jimbo,
Ned, and Mr. Garrison watch from across the street.]

MR. GARRISON
Look, there's more of them moving into
our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is
building a house up on Cannon, and some
Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic
place up on Main.

JIMBO
Yep, there goes the neighborhood.


MR. GARRISON
That's the fifth family of them that's
moved here. Seems like all of a sudden
South Park is being overrun by those
types.

KYLE'S FATHER
Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"?


MR. GARRISON
Yiou know, those types! Rich people!


JIMBO
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk.
Neither does Ned.

NED
Nnnope.

JIMBO
I remember back in the day, RICH folk
weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're
movin' here in droves!

SKEETER
They're gonna be sending their kids
to our schools, and mixin' them with
our pure, non-rich kids!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before
they drove all of us poor underachieving
people out of town with inflated real-estate
costs!

SKEETER
Damn, I hate those stupid richers!


MR. GARRISON
Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich!
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's
in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook?


JIMBO
Yeah. How many rich people does it take
to screw in a light bulb? None! They
can hire people to do it for them!


MR. GARRISON
Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers
have such big garages? 'Cause they need
a place for all their Porsches and boats
and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's
right, cashchucker! Go have fun with
your two million dollar house!

JIMBO
I guess we showed them!

[Another house, nearby. A crane is positioning a swimming pool.
Oprah Winfrey directs the workers from the edge of the lawn]


OPRAH WINFREY
A little to the left. That's great and-
Let's put another pool over there.
Uh huh, good.

FREDERICK
Token, these are Oprah's newly-adopted
children, Dominique and Zizi.

DOMINIQUE AND ZIZI
Hello.

TOKEN
Hi.

A BOY
Cheerio!

FREDERICK
Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids:
P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and
Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size.

TOKEN
Wow, my plan to get rich people here
sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea!
Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.


LISA
Oh no, we're going shopping.

THE KIDS
Shopping!

FREDERICK
Yes, come Token. We're all going to
head down to the mall and buy some of
the stores.

TOKEN
Oh. Alright then.

[The local bar, night. It's pretty busy, with people chatting
away and enjoying their beer. Some motion is seen outside the
doors, and soon they open. Three rich men enter and scan the
bar, then move to a nearby table and sit. One of them is Kobe
Bryant]

KOBE BRYANT
'Scuse me, can ew get a couple of beers
here?

SKEETER
They've got nice expensive beers for
you across the street at the new Wolfgang
Puck's.

KOBE BRYANT
That's alright, we just want some cheap
beer tonight.

BARKEEP
...Maybe you didn't see the sign out
front: This bar is for people livin'
below their means ONLY!

MEN
Yeah!

KOBE BRYANT
This is a free country. I can have a
drink wherever I want.

MAN 1
Come on, Kobe, let's just go.

KOBE BRYANT
This ain't over! This ain't over by
a long shot!

MR. GARRISON
Those richers are getting snooty. We've
got to show those richers they're not
welcome here!

NED
Nn-what do you mean?

MR. GARRISON
How about tonight, we sneak up to one
of their houses, and right on their
lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase
t!

JIMBO
Lowercase t?

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, for "time to leave"!

BAR PATRONS
Yeah!

MR. GARRISON
Jimbo, you take some folk and build
a big wooden lowercase t! I'll take
the rest and get some gas and torches
ready!

MR. GARRISON
Alright!

[Kobe's mansion, night. Through a bay window he's seen reading
his newspaper in an armchair near a fireplace. A FOOM is heard
and a flicker of light is reflected on the walls outside Kobe's
house. He notices, takes a hard look, rises from his chair and
goes to the front door. He opens it, annoyed, but his expression
changes to one of fright. He sees the lowercase t burning on
the lawn]

KOBE BRYANT
Tee. T- Time to- leave?

MR. GARRISON
T is for "time to leave," cashchucker!


KOBE BRYANT
I'm callin' the police.

SKEETER
I think we scared 'im.

JIMBO
Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital
T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!


MEN
Yeah!

[South Park, new polo grounds, day. A group of rich kids gather
to begin a polo game. They all ride on ponies.]

FREDERICK
Now Token, polo is very simple. You
simply must hit the williard into some
cilium with your fracaman.

TOKEN
Well, yeah, but can't we just play without
these uncomfortable uniforms?

FREDERICK
"Can't we play without the uniforms?"
Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's
as well!  Now come, Token, and remeber:
it doesn't matter who wins. It matters
who wins three times in a row. Tally
ho!

PLAYERS
Tally ho!

PLAYER 1
Oh!

PLAYER 2
Yay!

PLAYER 3
This is exciting.

PLAYER 4
Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!

CARTMAN
What in the hell are they doing?

KYLE
Is that fun?

STAN
I don't know. We don't have horses,
so we can't play.

CARTMAN
Well, let's just play our game, then.


KYLE
Alright.

CARTMAN
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in
the nuts, Kenny!

KENNY
(Ow!)

KYLE
I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan!

STAN
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman!


CARTMAN
Kick his nutsack!

FREDERICK
You see, you must pay attention, Token.
I was able to jollyrow your davishmere
with a forecastle.

TOKEN
This game is too confusing. How about
we have a snowball fight?

PLAYER
A snowball fight?

LISA
How barbaric.

FREDERICK
Yes, Token, if you want to play such
savage games, I suggest you go live
with lions.

TOKEN
I don't fit in anywhere.

[South Park, another part of town. Bill Cosby and his two kids]


BILL COSBY
-ar. We're going to the zoo, and we
can eat Jerro pudding.  Ah, this is
goin' to be fun kids. We're goin' to
the zoo, we could eat the Jerro pudding
and chocolate cake.

PASSENGER 1
Hey! What are you doing? If you're going
to ride the bus in South Park, you're
gonna have to sit in the FRONT!

PASSENGERS
Yeah

PASSENGER 2
Yeah, that's where the first-class seating
is!

PASSENGER 1
Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!


BILL COSBY
Well it's very nice, actually

PASSENGER 1
Yeah, I'll bet it is!

BILL COSBY
Very, very comfy.

PASSENGER 1
Uh huh, looks like it.

[A field, a while later. Token stands there talking to someone]


TOKEN
Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit
in with all the kids at South Park Elementary
so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to
move to town. The problem is, I don't
fit in with them, either. That's why
I've come to live with you.  So if you'll
have me and raise me as one of your
own, I promise to be the best lion I
could be.  Uuuh, yeah.

[Chef's house, day. Chef is seen shoveling snow off his driveway]


CHEF
Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice,
heavy and wet. Just-

OPRAH WINFREY
You there, come march with us!

CHEF
For what?

OPRAH WINFREY
All the poor people in town think they
can persecute and harass us decent rich
folk.

WILL SMITH
So we're uniting and marching on the
town square!

KOBE BRYANT
The Million Millionaire March!

OPRAH WINFREY
Come on, brother!

CHEF
But... I'm not rich.

WILL SMITH
What?

CHEF
I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah
I don't make much money.

WILL SMITH
We'll give you a hundred dollars.

CHEF
Woo, fudge the snow now.

CHEF
I shall perservere. We shall perservere.


[The lions' lair at the zoo, later. Token takes a raw steak and
bites into it, growling]

TOKEN
RRrrr!!

GIRL
Look at the little black lion, Mommy.


MOM
He's cute, isn't he?

TOKEN
Roar!

LION 1
What are you doing here, boy?

TOKEN
You- you talked. I, I understood you.
I must be becoming a lion!

LION 2
You're not becoming a lion. The only
way you can do that is to see Aslan.


TOKEN
Who's Aslan?

LION 1
Very well, walk this way.

ASLAN
Is this the boy who's been living in
our realm?

LION 2
Yes.

TOKEN
Are... you... Aslan?

ASLAN
M-I am.

TOKEN
Well, I'm Token

ASLAN
So, you want to live with the lions,
do you?

TOKEN
Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in
anywhere else.

ASLAN
And what makes you think you can fit
it with us?

TOKEN
Well, I don't know.

ASLAN
Do you like jokes?

TOKEN
What?

ASLAN
Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions
love jokes.

TOKEN
...I like jokes a lot.

ASLAN
Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you
yet, young apprentice lion. Very well.
We wihill let you stay, if... you can
pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on,
try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull
my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho!


TOKEN
So can I stay?

ASLAN
He-you may. But being a lion may be
harder than you think.

[The local bar, later. The bar patrons watch a TV as a report
is heard. Seen are Mr. Garrison, Randy, Stuart, Skeeter, Gerald,
Jimbo, and Ned.]

REPORTER
A billion billionaires are gathering
their ranks and will be marchng on the
town square tonight  in South Park to
petition the end of separate bars, bus
seating and restaurants. It looks like
it will be a great turnout, as some
of the millionaires also paid several
thousand Mexicans to march for them.


SKEETER
If they get that petition passed, it's
all over.

JIMBO
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't
fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.


MR. GARRISON
Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?


SKEETER
They won, Garrison. They can't be scared
out of town.

MR. GARRISON
No! We just haven't scared them the
right way! Think about it. What scares
rich people more than anything?

JIMBO
...Ghosts?

MR. GARRISON
Bingo! Rich people don't want to live
in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!


MEN
Yeah!

MR. GARRISON
Everyonen get some sheets from home!
If we can't chase the richers out, we'll
spook 'em out!

MEN
Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!

[The zoo, lion's lair, night. The lions have eaten and lay about
on the boulders. One by one, they belch and the others laugh.
Token sets his bowl down...]

TOKEN
Huuuunh  Aslan.

ASLAN
Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?


TOKEN
...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.

ASLAN
Home. But I thought your friends made
fun of you at home.

TOKEN
They do. But, I guess I learned something
today. You see, even though kids at
South Park make fun of me, I still like
hanging around them more than snobby
rich kids or, lions. Even though I may
be different from them, I still like
my old friends best.

ASLAN
It sounds like you learned much, young
lion apprentice. Very well. But before
you go, perhaps you would like... a
stick of gum?

TOKEN
...No thanks.

ASLAN
Go on. It's spearmint!

TOKEN
No, because there's a spring in there,
and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna
hurt my finger.

ASLAN
Oh. So you don't want any gum then?
Are you... sure? Go on, try it!

TOKEN
Ow.

ASLAN
That is good stuhuff!

TOKEN
Jesus, lions suck!

[South Park town square, night, in front of the Mayor's office.
The billionaires are present, and Will Smith is at the podium]


WILL SMITH
And so it is with great determination
that us decent rich Americans have gathered
to say: "We will be separated no more!"


MILLIONAIRES
Hooray!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
This certainly has been an enlightening
evening. And as Mayor, I accept your
petition and will abolish all separation
laws.

MILLIONAIRES
Yeah!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
And I want to assure the nation that
is watching that South Park is not a
town of prejudice or bigotry.

VOICES
Woooooo!!

OPRAH WINFREY
What the-?

MAYOR MCDANIELS
God no.

WILL SMITH
AAAaaahhh!

MILLIONAIRE 1
Carl, do you see what I see?

CARL
Yes, Martin. I do believe this town
is hainted.

WILL SMITH
Kids! Go find the limo and get in!


SNOOP DOGG
You didn't tell me this town was hainted!


WILL SMITH
I didn't know!  I.. DIDN'T... KNOHOHOHOW...


SKEETER
It's working!

KYLE'S FATHER
They're scared to death!

[A mansion, the same one Mr. Garrison and the men saw earlier
as they commented on the new richers moving in, night. The family
rushes towrads the front door]

MILLIONAIRE
Pack up your things quickly! We've got
to get out of here!

[The town, night. "Ghosts" continue to chase the millionaires
around. In the background, Stan leads a group of boys down the
street. With him are Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Pip, Tweek, Clyde,
and Craig]

STAN
Oh hey, there's Token.

TOKEN
Hey guys.

STAN
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do
you wanna play?

TOKEN
You mean, you want me around?

STAN
Sure, dude, you're our friend.

TOKEN
Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip
on me for bein' rich.

STAN
Dude, just because we rip on you for
being rich doesn't mean we don't like
you.

KYLE
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something
about all our friends to rip on. We
made fun of you for being rich just
like we make fun of Butters for being
wimpy.

BUTTERS
They sure do.

STAN
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being
a Jew.

KYLE
Right.

TOKEN
That's right, huh?

KYLE
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.


STAN
Yeah, I get it for that.

KYLE
And Cartman for being fat

CARTMAN
Uh huh.

KYLE
And Cartman for being stupid

CARTMAN
Yeah.

KYLE
And Cartman for having a whore for a
mom.

CARTMAN
Hey!

KYLE
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole


CARTMAN
Ey, you did me already!

TOKEN
You're right, guys. From now on, I'm
fine with being made fun of for being
rich.

STAN
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for
being rich anymore.

TOKEN
You're not?

KYLE
No dude. Because since you got your
feelings so hurt for being ripped on,
now we think you're a pussy.

STAN
Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.


KYLE
Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play
football, you puss.

CARTMAN
Pussy.

BUTTERS
Heh yeah, later, puss.

CRAIG
Ha, that guy's a pussy.

TOKEN
Wait! I liked being ripped on for being
rich better!

[The rich enclave, later. The men of South Park have succeeded
in chasing the rich folks out of town, and they gather in front
of a mansion. They take off their sheets]

SKEETER
That was it. We just saw the last of
them speeding away in a van!

MEN
Alright!

KYLE'S FATHER
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll
never be back!

MR. GARRISON
That's great! And now we can sell all
their homes, and become... millionaires!


MEN
What?

JIMBO
But then you had us do all that for
nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich
sellin' these homes, then there will
still be rich people in South Park.


RANDY
Yeah. You'd become what you hate.

MR. GARRISON
Well yeah, but at least I got rid of
all those damn ni-

"GOOD TIMES WITH WEAPONS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Park County Fair, day. South Park is more spread out these days.
Looking like a small city now. People mill around. The boys walk
along a fairway. Cartman pulls out a small firecracker and tosses
it on the ground before Kyle and cackles softly]

KYLE
Stop it, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Pfaha, so funny.

KYLE
Goddamnit Cartman, stope throwin' those
stupid popping things at me!

ROGER
Come on and take a look, folks. We've
got a lot of knives for sale here.


STAN
Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons
from the Far East.

KYLE
Wow, cool.

STAN
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and
then we'll be like ninjas.

CARTMAN
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from
anybody.

KYLE
Our parents won't let us have weapons,
dude.

CARTMAN
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!

STAN
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be
at the stupid fair all day long. They'll
never know what we bought.  I'll get
the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.

CARTMAN
I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look
Kenny! There's something even you can
afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar
ninety nine.

KENNY
(Shuriken. Awesome!)

ROGER
Can I help you boys?

STAN
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these
ninja weapons.

ROGER
Okay, uh, you need to have your parents
here when you buy them, though. I, I
can't sell to anyone under eighteen
without parents' permission.

CARTMAN
Parents? Parents??  Oh God!

ROGER
Uh wha, what's the matter?

STAN
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents...
died in a car accident last year.


CARTMAN
Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take
them both?! Why!  Why?!

KYLE
Why do people have to keep reminding
us of what we don't have??

ROGER
It's all right, it's all right boys.
Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack
these up for you, okay?

STAN
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time
that's worked.

[Cartman's house, moments later. The boys are in his basement
mastering their new weapons. Each boy gets the weapon he wanted.
Kyle gets the yellow-ended nunchakus]

STAN
Kiya! Kiya!

KYLE
Kaii yo!

CARTMAN
Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!
Iya!

STAN
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become
the great and powerful ninja Sharohachi,
born to fight evil and people I don't
like.

KYLE
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make
me into Bounaku , a deadly but compassionate
ninja who protects those in trouble.


STAN
What's your ninja name, Kenny?

KENNY
(unintelligible)

CARTMAN
Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute
ninja who has dedicated his life to
eradicating the world of hippies

STAN
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect
the world!

CARTMAN
Kick ass!

[Outside, the neighborhood. The boys walk out onto a new, more-detailed
landscape]

CARTMAN
Hey you guys, you know what we should
do? We should go show our weapons to
Craig and those guys. They'll be so
jealous.

KENNY
(Hey yeah, that'd be awesome!)

KYLE
No dude, we can't go around showing
our weapons to people. Our parents'll
find out we have them.

CARTMAN
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews
can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!


KYLE
You don't know anything about Jews,
fatass!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel
Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel
Gibson says you are a sloth and you
are a liar. And if the Road Warrior
says it, it must be true.

STAN
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna
tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.
All right, this is it.

CARTMAN
Yes. The residence of the one called...
Craig.

KYLE
I still say this is a bad idea.

[Craig's house. Stan pounds on the door]

STAN
Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!

CARTMAN
Look what we got.

CRAIG
Where'd you get those?

STAN
We can't tell you where we got 'em!
It's secret ninja stuff.

CARTMAN
Oooh, is that jealousy I see in your
eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the
sweet water of your envy.

CRAIG
Uh, uh, they're not that cool.

STAN
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These
are real authentic weapons from the
Far East.

KYLE
But don't tell anybody we have them.


CARTMAN
Ugh.

TOKEN
Whoa! Where'd you get those??

CLYDE
Let me see.

STAN
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but
we have important secret work to do.


CARTMAN
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex
and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!


ALL
Ho!

[On the road]

CARTMAN
Ho man, did you see the look on Craig's
face?! That was awesome!

STAN
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in
the whole state!

BUTTERS
Huhey fellas. What's happenin'?

CARTMAN
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.

BUTTERS
Wowee! Hey, can I play, uhninjas with
you?

CARTMAN
No, Butters. We are a very select elite
fighting team sent to protect the world
from evil, and you can't play with us.


STAN
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very
good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have
a lot of work to do.

CARTMAN
Yes, and no time to do it. No time...


BUTTERS
I think I'd make a really good ninja.
Jeez, those guys never let me play
with them. Uh they just shun me all
the time.

[Butter's house. He walks past behind the couch, where his mom
reads a book unaware of the emotion in his voice]

BUTTERS
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow
of a person-

LINDA
Hi Butters.

BUTTERS
Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live
his life out in solitude.  And it's
because of times like these I was forced
to a life of evil.  Society cast me
out, and so I vowed to make them all
pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows
that beneath this sweet eight-year-old
little boy lies the most evil, the most
destructive supervillain of all time!
Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you
like dealing with me, ninjas!

LINDA
Oooh, Butters, are you going out to
play again?

BUTTERS
Yeah Mom, I'm jus' goin' outside for
a little while.

LINDA
Well, could you be a sweetie and take
that pie over there to the Thomsons.
I made it to thank them for babysitting
you last week.

BUTTERS
Well, okay-okay Mom.  Bah! Gah!

[On the road. The boys are shown in their anime forms]

STAN
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right
way. My ninja sense is telling me we
might be heading in the wrong direction.


KYLE
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special
power to see into the future and find
out where we should head next.

CARTMAN
Hold on you guys. I actually have another
power. I can see into the future too,
but better than Kyle. Let me try it.


KYLE
Goddamnit, Cartman! You can't keep making
up new powers!

STAN
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power
you've come up with!

CARTMAN
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots
of powers.

KYLE
No asshole! From now on you only get
to have ONE power! So what is it?!


CARTMAN
I have the power to have all the powers
I want.

KYLE
That doesn't count, fatass!

STAN
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get
to have any powers!

CARTMAN
C'mon!

BUTTERS
Haaa hahahaha!  Well well well! If it
isn't the four ninjas!

KYLE
Who the hell is that??

STAN
I dunno. Craig, is that you?

BUTTERS
Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer
of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble
ninja powers are no match for me!


KYLE
Whoa.

CARTMAN
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you
guys.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

STAN
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play
along. Now, fell the fiery sting of
my tonfa Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks
you down.

BUTTERS
Nuh uh!

STAN
Yeah huh, I got you!

BUTTERS
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of
a ...titanium alloy that shields me
from heat!

CARTMAN
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!


KYLE
Well, let's see how he likes the icy
blasts from my nunchakus Sokuromoto!


BUTTERS
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both
of you shall feel the power of my Web
of Holding!  Hahahahaha! You are both
trapped in spiderwebs!

CARTMAN
All right, dickhole! Time for you to
pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle
took them away from me! Quick, Kyle,
give me back my powers so I can fight
this evil villain!

KYLE
Okay, okay, you can have your powers
back.

CARTMAN
All right! And now I will use my power
to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh!


KYLE
Goddamnit Cartman!

CARTMAN
Hahahahahaaa ha! Now you are a chicken!
Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!

BUTTERS
Enough! Uh I grow weary of your foolishness.
Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!


STAN
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!


KENNY
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)
(Feel my wrath!)

CARTMAN
Oh, fuck dude!

STAN
It's Butters. Oh my God!  Oh, dude!
It's stuck in his eye!

KYLE
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!


KENNY
(I just threw it like Stan asked me.)


BUTTERS
It hurts! It hurts!

KYLE
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!


STAN
Ssh sshhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm
down. It's not that bad, really.

BUTTERS
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'.
I gotta go to the hospitalll!!

STAN
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll
be okay!

CARTMAN
Guys, meeting over here for a second?
All right you guys, we need to stay
calm and just do the right thing. We
have to kill Butters and bury him in
Kyle's backyard.

STAN
Dude, shut up!

KYLE
I agree with Cartman!

STAN
What??

KYLE
You don't understand what my mom will
do to me if she finds out I was playing
with weapons!

[a closeup of the shuriken lodged in Butters' left eye, moments
later. Some pliers clamp on to it and the camera pulls back.
Stan is holding the pliers and he tugs gently at the shuriken.
Butters sits on a tree stump]

STAN
Just stay still, Butters.

BUTTERS
Hwa.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!

KYLE
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his
brain!

CARTMAN
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't
remember it was us.

BUTTERS
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have
to take me to the hospital!

KYLE
If we take him to the hospital, they're
gonna find out what happened.

STAN
God-damnit!

KYLE
God? Please, if you get me out of this,
I swear, I will never play with weapons
ever again.

CARTMAN
Don't be so quick to throw off your
ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come
on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja
when everything's going your way, but
it's times like these, when the chips
are down, that a ninja shows his true
character.

BUTTERS
Whoa, I'm getting woozy.

CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way
out of this. We just have to use our...
ninja reasoning.

STAN
We... need a doctor... But we can't
go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait,
wait, wait what about the veterinarian?


CARTMAN
Dr. Shafley?

STAN
He's really old and and goin blind.


CARTMAN
So if we make Butters up to look like
a dog,...

KYLE
Ohh no.

STAN
We might pass him off as our pet.

BUTTERS
Ohoo but, but fellas, if I, if I dress
up like a dog with a star in my eye,
I I'm gonna get grounded.

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters!

KYLE
That is the dumbest idea you guys have
ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity
out of Cartman, but you, Stan?? Butters
needs medical attention right now!!


STAN
All right, then you take him to the
hospital, Kyle. You take him to the
hospital and let your mom find out what
happened.

[Moments later. Butters is made up to look like a dog. He sobs
in resignation. Kyle holds a bottle of glue.]

CARTMAN
I need the modeling glue. We need more
fur over here.

BUTTERS
Uh that modeling glue is making me
dizzy.

CARTMAN
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit!
Now, stop being such an asshole!

KYLE
We need some more fur.  I think that's
good.

CARTMAN
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.


BUTTERS
Oh. Wuff, wu-wuff.

STAN
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him
into town.

[South Park, in what looks like Skid Row. Stan appears and walks
into a clearing]

STAN
Okay, it's clear.

CARTMAN
Now remember, Butters, when you get
to the vet's office, you need to stay
down on all fours and- Butters, listen!!
At the vet's office, you need to stay
down on all fours and bark a lot.


BUTTERS
Wuhuff, woof, woof.

KYLE
We've gotta hurry, it's getting late!


STAN
Oh shit, somebody's coming!

KYLE
Quick, hide Butters!

CARTMAN
In here!

BUTTERS
Uh buh, but fellas, I gotta-

CRAIG
Aha!  There you are! You guys thought
you were sooo cool, didn't you?! Well
look at what we got!

CARTMAN
No way, you got weapons too??

STAN
Where'd you get those?

JIMMY
From the n-n-, from the nn-, from the
nn-

CLYDE
From the nice guy at the county fair.


CRAIG
At first we needed our parents' permission,
but then we told him our parents were
dead.

CARTMAN
Aw man, now every douchebag in town
has a weapon! Lame!

CRAIG
So,  how would you ninjas like to do
battle?

STAN
Uh not now, Craig, we we have to be
going.

CRAIG
You can't pass through this area until
you defend your honor!

KYLE
He said, not now, Craig!

CRAIG
I am not Craig,  I am Ginza,  with the
powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!


TOKEN
And I am Black Taku,  with the power
of perfect spelling!

STAN
Guys, we're we're really not playing,
okay?

JIMMY
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas?
Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?


CARTMAN
We're twice the ninjas you fags are!


CLYDE
Then fight us!

CARTMAN
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!!!

KYLE
I swore to never fight again.

STAN
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor
them.

CRAIG
Lose who?

KYLE
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck
in his eye, and we were taking him to
the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!


CRAIG
Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?


CARTMAN
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back
here right now!

CRAIG
Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're
outta here!

STAN
No dude, you gotta help us find him!


CRAIG
The hell with that!

CARTMAN
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters
tells on us, we're gonna tell on you,
and that's the ninja code!

[The road, sunset. Butters walks along the side still sobbing,
looking for help]

BUTTERS
Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.
Eh. Woof, eh. Woof.

STAN
Butters!

KYLE
Butters!

CARTMAN

KENNY

Hey Butters!

Butters!

KYLE
Dude, look!

CHEF
Hello there, children!

THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.

CHEF
How's it goin'?

STAN
Bad.

CHEF
Why bad?

KYLE
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters
around, have you?

CHEF
No, can't say that I have. Hey, what
are you children doin' with those weapons?


STAN
Nnothing, just, playing.

CHEF
Well, you children should be careful
with those. You could put somebody's
eye out.

KYLE
Yeah, we know.

CHEF
Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds.
They're about to start the big auction.
So long, children!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Butters closes in on it, babbling
incoherently and stumbling along. He enters the emergency area,
moves in a few feet, and falls flat on his back]

NURSE
Oh my God!  What the-? Doctor? Doctor??


DR. DOCTOR
Jesus Christ.  What kind of sick bastard
would do this to a dog? Poor little
pup.

BUTTERS
Woofwoof.

NURSE
Can you help him, Doctor?

DR. DOCTOR
I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately
for this little fella, I'm a people
doctor. Best we call the animal shelter.


NURSE
Right away.

ANNOUNCER
In our last episode the four ninjas
did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer
of destruction and doom. It was during
that great battle that ninja master
Kenny threw his star into Professor
Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious
trouble, because their parents might
find out they had weapons if Professor
Chaos told on them. While trying to
get Professor Chaos some aid at the
veterinarian's office, the four ninjas
ran into Craig and his three friends.
They challenged the four ninjas to fight,
and the legendary battle of Tokutawa
began. It was during this battle that
Professor Chaos escaped , and so the
four ninjas were forced to join forces
with Craig and his friends to find Professor
Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.


STAN
Butters!

KYLE
Butters!

CARTMAN
Here, Butters!

KENNY
(Butters!)

CRAIG
Butters!

CLYDE
Butters!

TOKEN
Butters!

CRAIG
Butters! Where the hell are you?!

KYLE
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have
made it to the hospital. By now our
parents probably know we were playing
with weapons! We have to get rid of
the evidence!

STAN
What?

KYLE
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons
so at least we can try to deny everything.


CARTMAN
Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks
for these things!

STAN
Yeah, let's just go return them and
get our money back.

KYLE
We don't have time for that, dude! We
just have to ditch them! Now!

CARTMAN
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchakus
away. If you can. But you know well
that your Jewish blood won't let you.
You can't throw away something you paid
fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.


KYLE
Screw you, fatass!

CARTMAN
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now
the Jew in you is screamig "NO! Those
cost money! Get your money back!" You
know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove
Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it!

KYLE
I, I can't do it. ... I can't do it.
I...

STAN
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back
to the fair and return them.

[South Park Animal Shelter, day. Dogs and cats are heard. Inside,
an elderly veterinarian pulls something along on a leash]

VET
Come on. Come on, little fella. Atta
boy.

BUTTERS
Woof woof.

VET
Right over here.  Good dog. Come on.
There you go, right in there.  Goooood
dog.

BUTTERS
Gaaaah!

ASSISTANT
Somebody threw a ninja star in that
poor puppy's eye?

VET
It just makes me sick how some people
can treat animals.  Well, nothing we
can do for it; let's put it to sleep,
shall we?  Here you go, pup. I've got
a sweet dose of murder for you.  What
the? Blasted! He's escaped! ... Oh well,
let's murder one of these other dogs.


[The county fair, anime form, sunset]

STAN
All right, the county fair's still open!


ROGER
Can I help you boys?

STAN
We have come to return the weapons we
purchased.

ROGER
Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.


KYLE
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna
kill us, and you, if they found out
that we bought these!

ROGER
I thought you told me your parents were
dead.

CRAIG
You guys!  You guys!

STAN
What is it, Craig?

CRAIG
It's Butters! We saw 'im!

KYLE
Where?!

CRAIG
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds.
He's just wandering around aimlessly.


KYLE
Then it's NOT too late!

STAN
Come on, Ninjas!

MR. GARRISON
All right, folks, our next item up
for bids is this lovely 19th Century
lamp/

STAN
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.


CRAIG
Butters is right on the other side.


KYLE
We have to get past them!

CARTMAN
All right. Looks like I have to use
my power of invisibility to get by.


KYLE
You have that power too?

CARTMAN
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots
of powers. Behold.  This way, I can
move about the crowd of people undetected.
Here, hold this stuff for me.

STAN
Good luck, Bulrog.

A BARKER
Now, this lamp comes from the estate
of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived
in upstate Wyoming.  It has a bronze
finish and actual gold leaf along the
base. Uh this is a rare opportunity
to own a classic antique.  The lamp
has been appraised by our auction staff
at well over two thousand dollars.
So we're gonna start the bidding at
three hundre seventy five. Do I, do
I hear three hundred and seventy five?
Kid, what the hell do you think you're
doin'?

BUTTERS
Haba, hava! Havahoaha!

LINDA
Butters!

RANDY
What happened to him?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh my God!

STAN
Ohhh Jesus.

KYLE
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.

[Park County Community Center, Emergency Town Meeting, day. The
chatter among the adults present is heated]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people, we are all extremely
upset over what's happened.  But let's
try to speak one at a time.

MAN 1
Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked
and appalled at what happened! I don't
know if the parents are to blame or
if it's the times we're living in, but
something has to change!

TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! I agree!

KYLE'S FATHER
This is the worst thing that's happened
in this town!  The worst thing!

MAN 2
Yeah! I mean, there were children watching
that auction! And when that little eight-year-old
boy walked up and flashed his... penis...
it was an outrage!

STAN
What?

CARTMAN
What?

SKEETER
Not only that, the auction was televised
on public access, so my little daughter
watchin' at home saw the -penis! How
am I suppsoed to explain that to her?!


KYLE'S MOTHER
This is what happens when the moral
fabric of society breaks down!

MR. GARRISON
You see the damage you've caused, Eric
Cartman?! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!


CARTMAN
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction!


KYLE
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters'
eye out with weapons?

STAN
Just run with it, dude.

KYLE
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh my fragile little
eight-year-old mind didn't know how
to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman
should be punished!

MAN
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!

[Park County Community Center, outside. The doors open and Stan,
Kyle, and Kenny exit onto the parking lot]

KYLE
Heck, I c- I can't believe it.

STAN
Hyeah. I guess parents don't give a
crap about violence if there's sex things
to worry about.

KYLE
So I guess this means we get to keep
our weapons.

STAN
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some
more work to do.

THE BOYS
Hya!

"THE WACKY MOLESTATION ADVENTURE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, day, Kyle's house. Kyle is playing football with
Ike on the front lawn. The football rests in front of Ike]


KYLE
Come on. Throw the football, Ike.

IKE
No on dahdo.

STAN
Dude!  You're not gonna believe what
Cartman has!

KYLE
Hepatitis B?

CARTMAN
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row,
for the Raging Pussies!

KYLE
...You got Raging Pussies tickets??

STAN
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's
got the bus schedule all figured out!


KYLE
Hold on. I'll be right back.

[Kyle's house, living room. On the sofa Gerald reads a newspaper,
Sheila reads a book. Kyle rushes up to them]

KYLE
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to
see the Raging Pussies?

KYLE'S MOTHER
No, Kyle.

KYLE
But all the guys are going!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those
concerts are dangerous and vile.

KYLE
But Mom, I-

KYLE'S FATHER
The answer is no, Kyle!

KYLE
Ugh!

[Kyle's house, front lawn. Kyle rejoins the boys]

KYLE
My parents said I can't go.

STAN
Well, of course your parents said you
can't go!

CARTMAN
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go!
I'm telling my parents I'm staying at
Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents
he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's
not telling his parents anything, 'cause
they're alcoholics and they don't care!


KENNY
(Yeah!)

KYLE
Ah. Oh, now I already told them.

CARTMAN
Well, I guess you're screwed, then.


KYLE
No! It's alright! Just give me some
time to work on them. I'll see you guys
later.

[Kyle's house, living room. Kyle tries to persuade his parents]


KYLE
...But what if I do a bunchof chores around
the house? Come on, you're being unfair!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the
Raging Pussies concert if you clean
out the garage, shovel the driveway
and bring democracy to Cuba!

KYLE
What's Cuba?

KYLE'S FATHER
A communist country run by a dictator
named Fidel Castro.

KYLE
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway,
or just the side the car is on?

KYLE'S MOTHER
The whole thing.

KYLE
Hoh, geez.

[Kyle's house, his bedroom, night. He's at his desk writing a
letter. He's done his other chores]

KYLE

DEAR MR. CASTRO


My name is Kyle.

[thinks]

I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.


[Centro Nacional de Cuba. Castro, flanked by an armed guard on
each side, is at his desk reading Kyle's letter]

And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,


If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.

[Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which
fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter]

Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain

All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea

[Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world
globe]

Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free

[Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house]

I just can't be very happy, that's certain

[A picture of Kyle replaces his self-portrait on the paper]


Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin'

[Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees
last]

Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your
mind?

That is my one and only wish.

CASTRO
¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!

[Kyle's house, living room, next day. He and his parents watch
TV and a news brief comes on. Kyle smiles, his parents are stuned]


Reporter	Once again, this does marks the end of Communism in
Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced
by a young boy's letter. [A shot of Kyle behind a wooden fence
comes up] Now the country is again open to American tourism.
[shot of Sheila and Gerald stunned] Plans can finally resume
for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. [Sheila and Gerald look at each
other]

KYLE
I did it! Now I can go to the Raging
Pussies!

KYLE'S MOTHER
No you can't!

KYLE
What??

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you
going to the Raging Pussies concert!
We gave you a chore that we thought
was impossible. You weren't supposed
to actually do it.

KYLE
But I did! Ah, I brought -democracy
to Cuba!

KYLE'S MOTHER
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want
you going to their concert.

KYLE
But that's not fair! You lied to me!


KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong,
buh- but you need to understand that
we don't want-

KYLE
What I understand is that you totally
screwed me over!! So why should I have
to listen to you?!

KYLE'S FATHER
Because we're your parents!

KYLE
We I wish I didn't have any parents!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle!

[Kenny's house, front steps. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit on the
steps as Kenny plays on the lawn with a fire truck]

KYLE
It's so unfair! How can my parents do
that to me?!

STAN
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes,
dude. They get off on it.

KYLE
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY
PARENTS!

CARTMAN
Well, you... could make them... go away
for a while.

KYLE
How?!

CARTMAN
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police
and have them take your parents away.


STAN
The police?

CARTMAN
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta
do is call the police and say that your
parents both molestered you.

KYLE
What's that?

CARTMAN
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted
to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend,
I just called the police, and said he
was molestering me, and I haven't seen
him for three months.

KYLE
Wow! Three months without parents!


KENNY
(Wow, that is awesome!)

STAN
But what do the police do to them?


KYLE
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever
they get. They're liars and cheats.


CARTMAN
You have to make it convincing, though,
when you call the police. You have to
be like,  "my parents molestered me."


KYLE
"My parents molestered me."

CARTMAN
No, but you've gotta cry, like this:
"My parents molestered me."  And then
they'll say somethng like, "Was it a
good touch or a bad touch?" and you
say  "Ih, it was a good touch" or- no
wait,  you say it was a bad touch.


KYLE
What's "bad touch"?

CARTMAN
Something about a swimsuit - I don't
remember, but you definitely answer
"bad touch."

KYLE
Okay, molestered, bad touch.

CARTMAN
Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.

[Kyle's house, front lawn, day. Police and press gather round
as the four boys and Ike watch by the driveway. Gerald and Sheila
exit the house followed by two policemen. Two reporters try to
ask them questions as cameras go off all around them]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would
never touch my children like that.


CASE WORKER
You do have the right to remain silent,
ma'am. I suggest you use that right.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Ugh, pleae, just listen to me!  What
about my children? Who will take care
of them?

CASE WORKER
Oh, now you care?! They're going to
live with their grandmother.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Their grandmother's been dead for three
years.  You're not listenng to me. Kyle,
tell these people that your  mother
never raped you! Tell them! It's my
fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!


CASE WORKER
They'll never be able to hurt you again.


KYLE
Cool, thanks.

CASE WORKER
Alright, folks. Our work here is done.


STAN, KYLE
Alright!

[Kyle's house, living room, shot of the hallway and stairs. "Old
Time Rock 'N' Roll" plays And so... Kyle slides into view in
his hat and underwear, facing away from the camera. He looks
left and his sunglasses are shown. As the first words are sung,
Kyle faces the camera and lip-syncs to them. With Chinpoko Mon
around them, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman jump gleefully up and down
on the sofa. In the kitchen Ike sticks a fork into the toaster.
Kyle dances some more.


Next scene is the Raging Pussies concert outside and inside a
stadum. The four boys are in the audience, and Kyle is still
in underwear.


Next scene shows kids from all over descend on Kyle's house for
a party at night. Everyone dances inside, some kids are eating
pizzaand Kyle is still in underwear]

STAN
Dude! Having no parents is awesome!
I'm gonna say my parents molestered
me, too.

CARTMAN
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents
molestered us!

KIDS
Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!

[Stan's house, living room. He's on the phone crying. Next scene,
his parents are hauled off by five cops. Shelley is shocked to
see her parents go, but Stan begins to dance. She looks at him
angrily and begins to pull her fist back. Stan stops dancing
and points at her. A cop hauls her off. Stan resumes dancing.




Cartman's house, front door. The door opens and Liane is hauled
out, then one man, then Chef. Cartman appears after them and
stops at the door, and waves goodbye to them.


South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's class. In front of the
class, she's hauled off. Then Principal Victoria is taken away,
and then Mr. Mackey, as Butters accuses him of somethng to the
case worker.


Four panes appear, with a child in each one calling the police




CANYON CITY

MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

[Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Ike sit on the sofa watching
TV]

TV ANNOUNCER
The following hot presentation is for
mature audiences only.

CARTMAN
You guys! Come out here!

[Downtown South Park. The sky is a deep blue and the streets
are clear of snow. Token, Butters and Kenny stand behind Filmore
and his friend. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Ike, and Clyde]

STAN
What's going on?

Cartman?	Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as
the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes
a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes
through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away]


KYLE
...Nothing.

CARTMAN
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult
left in town.  They've all been arrested,
and the ones that weren't arrested have
moved away because they're scared of
being arrested

KYLE
Not one adult left?

STAN
...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's
ours.

[The Rockies, some days later. A car winds its way down the winding
road in a snow storm]

WOMAN
Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we
are.

MAN
I haven't seen a road marker for miles.
What was the last highway we were on?


WOMAN
There has to be a town around here somewhere.


MAN
Maybe you're reading the map wrong.


WOMAN
Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads.


MAN
What the?  Oh no. No, no, no, no.

WOMAN
What's the matter with it?

MAN
I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have
to find some help quick. We're not gonna
make it more than a couple of miles.


WOMAN
Oh, look! There's a town up ahead.
Smiley Town? That's a strange name.


MAN
Well, it'll have to do. It's probably
the only town for a hundred miles.


[Smiley Town, a beat-up gas station. The car rolls up and the
man and woman get out. The woman joins the man on the driver's
side of the car.]

WOMAN
Hello? Is anybody here?

BUTTERS
Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?

MAN
...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at
our car.

BUTTERS
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic,
I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?


MAN
...It's... just you here?

BUTTERS
No, uh Craig's here, too.

MAN
Oh, good.

BUTTERS
But he's playing Spaceman right now.
Huh. Hey, Craig!

CRAIG
What?

MAN
Look we're in a bit of a spot here!
I've got a very important job interview
tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so
I have to get my car fixed fast! Is
there another garage in town?

BUTTERS
Huuuhhhh, no.

MAN
How about a phone? Can we just use the
phone?

BUTTERS
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid
the only phone that does work... is over
in Treasure Cove.

MAN
Fine! Can you take us there?

CRAIG
You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?


WOMAN
Yes.

BUTTERS
Uhh rrreeally are you sure?

MAN
Yes.

BUTTERS
Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where
it is.

[Downtown Smiley Town. Craig leads the couple down the streets
to a white line running down the center of a cross street]


CRAIG
This is the end of Smiley Town. The
only phone is somehwere in Treasure
Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna
have to cross the white line.

MAN
Well, can you help us find the phone,
please?

CRAIG
Hell no! I'm not crossing the white
line.

WOMAN
Why not?!

MAN
Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't
have time for Spaceman Spiff's little
games.

CRAIG
Craig.

MAN
What?

CRAIG
It's Spaceman Craig.

[Downtown Treasure Cove. The couple walks into this town to the
sound of ominous music. The town looks worse than Smiley Town
does.]

TWO SMALL VOICES
Carousel.

MORE VOICES
Nah nah nanah nah!

MAN
Look, there's an elementary school
Come on, there might be some teachers
inside.

LINDA


What is that? [the truck turns around and comes back]

WAAH [raises a foot to avoid being hit by the truck. The truck
goes down the street, then turns around and returns once more,
stopping in front of the frightened couple]

What do you want from us??

MAN
Linda, it's a remote-controlled car.
Looks like maybe there's a little camera
on it.

LINDA
Mark, I don't like this.

MARK
Relax, Linda, everything's fine.  Ow.
Ow.

LINDA
What is it?! Acid?!

MARK
No, ud, it's lemon juice.

LINDA
Oh God! Are you blind?!

MARK
No, it just really, really, really hurts!


LINDA
Mark? Mark, look.  Well, hello. What's
your name?  What- what do you want?


JENNY
We wanna play.

Linda	[panicked, rises] Mark, I'm scared!

MARK
Don't be scared. They're just kids.
Where are your parents?!

FILMORE
We already played with our parents.


JENNY
How, we wanna play wit' youuuu.

MARK
...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked
me out.

KINDERGARTNERS
We wanna play wit' you!

MARK
Get off me!

LINDA
Oh God, Mark! Help!

FILMORE
Oh no! She's crossing the white line!


KINDERGARTNERS
Whoa!

KINDERGARTNER
Spitwads!

CRAIG
Take that, kindergartners!

KINDERGARTNERS
Ew!

MARK
What the hell is gong on here?!

CRAIG
Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full
of them.

MARK
Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult
this instant!

CRAIG
I got new orders. I'm supposed to take
you to see the mayor.

MARK
The mayor! Good! Finally!

[Smiley Town City Hall, day. Pictures of Cartman adorn the building
and the path to the front door. A large inflatable King Kong
floats above the snow and is tethered to the ground below. Craig
and Butters liead Mark and Linda into the Mayor's office, where
they face Cartman behind the desk, and two other boys. Clyde
Frog sits on the desk at Cartman's right side, and his boombox
is at left.]

CARTMAN
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you
come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner,
as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would
like to ask you a few questions.

LINDA
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong
on here?! Where are your parents?!


CARTMAN
Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers.
They're not around.

MARK
No parents in the entire town? What
happened to them?

CARTMAN
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley
Town, and so I will ask the questions
around hyah!

LINDA
Look, just point us to a phone, kid,
alright?

CARTMAN
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the
phones... quite out of service.

MARK
No phones, either? How do you communicate?


CARTMAN
Butters, I need an ETA on the car,
stat.

MARK
Alright, we've had just about enough
here! That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen! I don't care what little
games you kids wanna play, we just want
outta here, alright?

BUTTER'S VOICE
It's gonna be about three days.

CARTMAN
So, it appears that you need me. Which
is good, because... I need you, too.
Ringy-ding?

MARK
I have the job interview of my life
in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to
get to a phone or a car!

ASSISTANT
Spitball!

CARTMAN
Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see
what we're dealing with here. Tonight
is Carousel. And they will try to kill
one of us. Eh, you two seem to have
the uncanny ability to cross the white
line. If you help us, we'll get you
what you need.

[Dividing line at the John Elway Memorial Park. The couple enters
the park, Mark on the left side of the line, Linda on the right
side]

LINDA
Mark, are we doing the right thing?


MARK
Look! If getting the stupid book will
get me a cell phone, I don't care!


LINDA
I just don't know if you're dealing
with these kids the right way.

MARK
Well, I told you I can't deal with
kids, Linda! That's why I don't want
to have children!

LINDA
Hey, I think you'd make a great father.


MARK
Oh, let's not go through this again,
Linda. D-  Look, here's the book they've
been talking about-  it makes no sense.


LINDA
My God! Mark!  What is it??

MARK
It's a boy.  They... killed him.

LINDA
The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out
of here.

KINDERGARTNERS
Nah nah nanah nah!

LINDA
Na-a-ah!

MARK
Oh no!

LINDA
Mark!

MARK
Uh. The fat kid told us to take it.


[Treasure Cove Elementary, evening. Inside, Mark and Linda are
tied, asleep and backs to each other, next to a bonfire.]

MARK
Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up!

KIDS
Nah nah nanah nah!

STAN
You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them.
Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.


KYLE
Yeah.

MARK
Why are you doing this?

STAN
How come you wanna help the fatass?!


MARK
Who?

KYLE
The fatass. The mayor.

MARK
Look, I have the job interview of my
life in less than-  -12 hours! I just
need a phone, and he said he'd help
me if I took your book so you couldn't...
kill them anymore.

STAN
You got foolied, outlander! We're the
only ones with a working phone. And
if you had taken our book, then it's
one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!


LINDA
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do
you children live in this town alone?


KYLE
Because we do. It was like this yesterday,
and the day before that.

LINDA
But what about before that?

STAN
You mean in the Before time? In the
long, long ago?

LINDA
Yes!!

STAN
If we tell you, will you help us stop
Fatass?

MARK
I'll do anything to get to a phone!


STAN
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're
gonna tell the story of the Before time
again.

KIDS
The Before time.

BOY
The story of the Before time.

STAN
Way back, in the long long ago, we
all lived by the birthgivers' laws.
But the birthgivers were unfair. They
made us go to bed early and eat broccoli.


KIDS
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

STAN
And so the fatass came up with a way
to have all the birthgivers disappear.
, by using the magic M word.

KIDS
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

STAN
Soon we were without power, water, or
fresh food. But we tried to survive.
Under the guidance of... the Provider.


KIDS
Provider. Provider.

STAN
The fatass and us disagreed on how to
worship the provider. The fatass tried
to make us follow his way by making
himself the school principal. So we
made ourselves the superintendents of
school. But then he just made himself
the mayor. The town split sides and
that's when the Provider got angry.


KIDS
Boo!

BOY
Bwack bwack!

KIDS
Coosh!

STAN
So now, every night, the Provider must
be appeased at Carousel. We need their
book so one of ours doesn't die.


KIDS
Carousel, Carousel.

STAN
We all know that one day, the Provider
will set us free. Make everything like
it was in the before time. In the long,
long ago.

MARK
Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight:
if I go get the fat kid's book on the
other side of the white line, you'll
show me where a cell phone is?

STAN
Yes. No foolies.

KIDS
No foolies.

[Treasure Cove Elementary, evening, outside. The couple is still
inside]

MARK
No, uh, it's it's it's right out here.
Come on.  Linda, I want you to just
go back to the car and wait for me,
alright? I'll go get that fat kid's
book so I can use their phone.

LINDA
Mark, I'm scared.

MARK
I know, but this will all be over soon.


[Canyon City Maximum Security Prison, day. Sheila, dressed in
prison orange, is brought into a large room to join the other
adults, and the door is locked behnd her.]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so
long!

KYLE'S FATHER
Hello, honey, how has prison been for
you?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, it's awful! Just awful.

SPEAKER
Alright parents, let's all take our
seats.  My name is Scott Evans, and
I am a prison rehabilitation counselor.


RANDY
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly
never touched our child.

KYLE'S FATHER
Eh, neither did we.

MRS. MCCORMICK
We didn't, either.

MR. EVANS
Enough, enough!  Look, it's obvious
we have a lot of emotional issues and
personal demons to face here. During
your prison time, you will all be spending
one hour a day in therapy here with
me. What I want you to do is learn to
control those sick, sexual urges you
have. Now we're gonna try an exercise:
I'm gonna confront you with vwhat you
lust after most.  Alright parents, now
I, I know this is difficult, but I want
you to just look at this child. Just
try to suppress your urges to rape him.
Just think about somethin' else. Think
about clouds and beaches. Don't think
about his supple, soft little body.


KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop
this!!

MR. EVANS
Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!

KYLE'S FATHER
I don't have any urges!

MR. EVANS
I can't help you if you won't admit
you need help!! Now sit down!  Look,
I know this is very difficult for all
of you. Most of you are still in denial
about what you've done! To you it seems
you've never raped your children at
all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu.
Now let's try again.  Look at this
young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight
it. Fight it!

[Smiley Town, street. Linda walks out from behnd a van.]

LINDA
Oh God, God, please just let us out
of this place.

BUTTERS
I thnk I found the problem, ma'am. A
broken window roller-upper.

LINDA
Oh no. NO!  Aaaah!

CARTMAN
Where is your husband?

LINDA
Uh, uh...

CARTMAN
Seize her!

[Treasure Cove Elementary, evening, school gym. Mark has returned]


MARK
Alright, I got the book for you.

STAN
Awesu-home!

MARK
Now, can I please have the cell phone?


KYLE
Sure, outlander. I'll get it

CARTMAN
Outlander!

[Treasure Cove Elementary, outside. Cartman, holding a taser,
leads the Smiley Town members to the school. Linda is bound and
gagged, but can still walk]

CARTMAN
Outlander! We have your woman! She still
lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood
was fair!

BUTTERS
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?


CARTMAN
Butters, calm down, ahright?

[Canyon City Maximum Security Prison, day, meeting room.]

MR. EVANS
Okay, so what are some other things
that we can do besides molest our children?


MAN
See a movie?

MR. EVANS
Sure, "see a movie"'s good.  We could
see a movie instead of molesting our
children. What else?

MRS. MCCORMICK
Make a sweater?

MR. EVANS
Uh huh. I'll put ah, "knitting, sewing."
Who's got another one?

BLOND MAN
Molest children?

MR. EVANS
Nonono, we're looking for things to
do besides molesting our children.


BLOND MAN
Oh. Fishing?

MR. EVANS
Fishing's good. Uh huh.

[John Elway Memorial Park, night. The two towns meet at the deviding
line, Linda with Smiley Town, Mark with Treasure Cove.]

CARTMAN
I believe you have something of ours,
outlander! Give it back, or the female
gets it!

LINDA
Mmrrhhhh!

CARTMAN
Heh, heheh.

LINDA
Rrrmm-mmrrhh!

MARK
Give him the book back.

STAN
No. If they have it, one of ours will
die for Carousel!

CARTMAN
We're running outu of time! Hand our
book over, quick!

MARK
Enough of this! You kids are all in
big trouble!

CARTMAN
The Provider awakes!

STAN
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side
doesn't have its book, fatass! That
means someone on your side is sacrificed
tonight.

CARTMAN
Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.
Butters, your turn.

BUTTERS
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!


MARK
Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody
tonight!

LINDA
Be careful, Mark. They'll nake you disappear
with the M word.

CARTMAN
Yeah, we'll call the police and say
you molestered us, too.

MARK
What?

BUTTERS
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take
me!

MARK
Is that what happened to the adults
here?! You lied to the police and said
they molested you?! My God, they were
your parents!

STAN
Parents?

MARK
The birth-givers! Your birthgivers.
Don't you remember? They are your providers!
Not some statue! And they're not up
in some fantastical faraway land now.
They're in prison. Probably crying
themselves to sleep, cold and lonely
and... I'm sure missing you all very,
very much.  Your birthgivers took care
of you. That's what their laws and their
rules were for, because they love you,
and they didn't want you to end up living
like... th-this!  He won't take care of
you. Your parents... your... providers...
will.

KYLE
Parents. Mom. Dad.

BUTTERS
Oh boy, here it comes!

MARK
If you want things to be the way they
were in the before time, in the long,
long ago, you all need to call the police
and tell them you lied about them M
word.

STAN
He's right, dude. Things were a lot
better with our parents around.

KYLE
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a
point. Things have gotten a lot worse
in the ten days since they've been gone.


MARK
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since
they left??

CARTMAN
Take him down.

BUTTERS
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm
ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.


KYLE
Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you
call the police for us?

LINDA
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with
kids after all.

MARK
Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we
should have some.

LINDA
Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting
my tubes ties tomorrow!

[South Park, day, neighborhood street. The town has been cleaned
up. The kids stand in front of a house waiting for a bus to roll
up. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Craig hold a banner among them which
reads, red letters on yellow background, "Welcome Home, PARENTS!"
Butters walks up]

STAN
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna
be back any minute!

KYLE
Do you think they're gonna pissed at
us for lying that they molested us and
sending them all to jail for ten days?


STAN
Well, they can't be too pissed off.
I mean, we made them a banner.

LINDA
Hey, kids.

STAN
Hey, you guys came back!

KYLE
Did you make it to your job interview?


MARK
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking
at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.


LINDA
And I got my tubes tied.

KIDS
Alright!

KYLE
Well, thnaks for everything, you guys.
You really helped us see how important
parents are.

KIDS
Yeah.

BUTTERS
Hey! Here they come!

KYLE
Mom! Dad!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kids!

PARENTS
...Come here, come here.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK.


KYLE
Yeah. We're fine.

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible
sexual abuse over the years. But we're
all better now.

KYLE
But you didn't do anything to me.

KYLE'S FATHER
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with
it through therapy and learned to admit
it.

KYLE'S MOTHER
It won't happen again.

KYLE
But, you guys, I-

SHARON
Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back
all the years of abuse, but we can't.


LIANE
We've learned to overcome it, son.
You'll see.

BUTTERS' FATHER
We love you, son, but we only love you
in a platonic way from now on.

BUTTERS
Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?


MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is
he?

JENNY'S MOTHER
Everything's gonna be alright now,
Jenny.  Come on, let's go home.

STAN
Huh.

KYLE
Huh.

MARK
Well, what are you kids gonna do now?


STAN
I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow
igloo?

KYLE
Sure.

CARTMAN
Snow igloos kick ass.

KYLE
Okay, hang on a second I-

STAN

KYLE
All right, all right!  Dude, what is

STAN
Trent Boyett is being released from
Juvenile Hall.

KENNY

Trent Boyett?? The kid from preschool??


STAN
Yeah. He just got paroled.

KYLE
Oh no! NO!

CARTMAN
Hey gaybots, what's goin' on?

KYLE
Trent Boyett is being released from
Juvenile Hall.

CARTMAN
Really? That's cool. When did-?  What

KYLE
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Oh, Holy Jesus, God is...

STAN
What the hell are we gonna do??

BUTTERS
Hey, is it true?? Trent Boyett is getting

CARTMAN
It's true.

BUTTERS
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta
hide!  Uh, oh boy!

CARTMAN
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We
are dead men.

KYLE
Look, m-maybe he's forgiven us. I mean,
we were only in preschool

[Flashback to preschool days. It's playtime, and the kids are
busy doing things, sliding and such.]

STAN
Dude, let's play Fireman.

KYLE
Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.


CARTMAN
Jews can't be firemen.

KYLE
Shut up, fatass!

CARTMAN
Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!


KENNY
(How about we put a real fire out?)


STAN
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out
a i>real fire. Then we'll be heroes!


CARTMAN
But how do we start a fire?

KYLE
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest,
baddest kid in preschool!

TRENT
Say Uncle!

BOY
Uncle!

TRENT
Say Uncle!

BOY
Uncle!

TRENT
What do you shitheads want?!

KYLE
Do you know how to start a fire?

TRENT
Sure! I burn lots stuff.

STAN
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.


KYLE
We're firemen!

TRENT
Do you fuckheads even know how to put
out a fire?

STAN
Yeah yeah, we play Fireman all the time.


CARTMAN
Don't worry, Trent.

TRENT
All right, fine.

BUTTERS
Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.


CARTMAN
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're
doing!

BUTTERS
Oh, all right then.

STAN
Wow, cool!

KYLE
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!

STAN
Woowoowoowoo, Clang clang clang clang
clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the
fire!

KYLE
We're heroes!  We saved the school.


TRENT
Put it out!

TEACHER
Trent Boyett, what have you done now?!


TRENT
They said they could put it out.

TEACHER
Children, get back away, now!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
I'm buuurniiing!

STAN
Put it out, put it out!

[South Park Elementary, moments later, still in the flashback.
The teacher is being put in an ambulance]

PARAMEDIC
Come on, hurry! We've gotta get her
to the hospital!

STAN
Dude, we are in so much trouble!

KYLE
My mon is gonna break my legs!

CARTMAN
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent
Boyett did.

STAN
That's true.

OFFICER
You boys! Trent is trying to tell us
the fire was YOUR idea.

STAN
No!

KYLE
Not us. We're good kids.

TRENT
Tell them it was an accident: you thought
you could put it out.

CARTMAN
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.

OFFICER
I thought so. All right, that's it,
Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall
for a long time!

TRENT
Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened!


BUTTERS
Ah, I'd do you in, Trent. Ah, I don't
wanna get involved. Or else my parents
will ground me.

TRENT
You'd better pray I never get out of
Juvenile Hall! You'd better ALL pray!


KYLE
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall,
he's gonna wanna kill us!

CARTMAN
Whatever. That's like five years from
now.

STAN
Yeah, who cares?

THE BOYS
All right, yeah, woohoo, we did it!


[The flashback ends and the boys are shown in the hall again.]


STAN
Now it's five years later. And Trent
Boyett is being released.

CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've
gotta tell our parents!

KYLE
We can't tell our parents, dude! We
lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're
responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!


STAN
Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now.


THE BOYS
Hello, Ms. Claridge.

STAN
Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge?


CARTMAN
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna
do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent
Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew.
He's gonna tear us apart!

KYLE
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe
Trent Boyett has forgotten all about
it.

[Juvenile Hall, outside, day, out in the desert. The sky looks
smoggy.]

[Juvenile Hall, inside. The gates in the hall roll back and a
mean Trent walks forward. On his right shoulder is written "Vengeance
is Mine, sayeth the Lord." Above the writing is a cross. On his
left shoulder is a skull surrounded by the words "Never Forget."
He approaches the check-out desk]

WARDEN
Everything that you had when you were
first brought in here will now be returned.
One Crayole eight-pack with crayon
sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped
scissors. One marble, blue. And one
switchblade knife with "Kill all betrayers"
written on the blade, black.  Trent!
Where are you gonna do?

TRENT
I gots business to take care of.

[Butters' house, day. In his darkened room, Butters trembles
in fear on the floor next to his bookcase. A knock is heard at
his door]

BUTTERS
Hah!

CHRIS
Butters?

BUTTERS
Hullo. Oh, uh hi Dad.

CHRIS
Butters, what is wrong with you??

BUTTERS
Nothin' wrong, sir. Eh nothin' at all.


LINDA
You've been shut up in your room for
days, Butters. You need to go outside,
go play.

BUTTERS
Uh... outside? No way!

LINDA
Why not?

BUTTERS
N-no reason!

CHRIS
Butters, we have had it with your moping
around! You're gonna go outside and
you're gonna play, right now!

BUTTERS
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-


[Butters' house, front porch. He's kicked out of the house and
the door shuts closed on him. He fiddles his fingers around nervously]


CHRIS
Butters, play!  Start playing right
now, young man!

BUTTERS
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! HAAA!  Dad!
Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!
AAAAAH! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad,
you gotta open the door!

LINDA
What on earth is the matter with him?


CHRIS
Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters
can't be a house hermit his whole life.


BUTTERS
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh here oh my
gosh he's gonna kill me!

LINDA
I just can't stand to hear him scream
like that. I'm gonna go upstairs.


BUTTERS
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right
now! You've gotta open it-  Oh hey!
Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen
you in a whle.

TRENT
Five years. It's been five long miserable
years.

BUTTERS
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful
sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool
and all, but... well that was a long
time ago. I mean, we were just kids.
Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent.
I-I'll give you anything you want. You
name it!

TRENT
Can you give me back my time? Huh? Can
you do that?? Kindergarten, first grade,
second? Can you give me that??

BUTTERS
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler
or nothin'.

TRENT
I'm gonna give you something you didn't
give me: a five-second head-start.


BUTTERS
No, Trent, I I ain't gonna run. We can
talk this through.

TRENT
Four seconds!

BUTTERS
Uh Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry
for the color-

TRENT
Three seconds!

BUTTERS
Ohhh yamuckers!

[Hell's Pass hospital, day. Butters wasn't fast enough. In a
recovery room, his parents stand at his bedside]

LINDA
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters
in the hospital, boys. It means a lot
to him.

CHRIS
What happened to him, Doctor?

DR. DOCTOR
From the test results, it would appear
your child was tortured by a bully.
He received a massive snuggie, his underwear
pulled up so high it nearly killed him.
He also received two Indian sunburns
on his forearms, a charlie horse on
the thigh, and a second-degree titty
twister. And from the damage to his
head area, it appears he was also given
a swirly, a colossal one.  It also appears
like he received a noogie, and, a Polish
bike ride.

LINDA
What's that?

DR. DOCTOR
We aren't sure. We only know that...
there is no cure.

LINDA
If only we had let him in!  Why didn't
we let him inside the house when he
was screaming for help??

CHRIS
Now, honey, we were trying to read.


CARTMAN
We've got to tell them who did this,
you guys. We're gonna get it as bad
as Butters!

KYLE
That's nothing compared to what my mom
will do to me if she finds out I've
been lying for five years!

CARTMAN
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there,
Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!


STAN
Calm down guys, we don't have to go
tell our parents. We just need to go
out and get some protection.

CARTMAN
How the hell are condoms gonna help
us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, heh.


STAN
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger
than Trent to protect us from him. Come
on!

[A riverbed. There's graffiti along the banks and sixth graders
ride their bikes all around the riverbed]

SIXTH GRADER 1
I'm gonna jump the wall of fire.  Yeah,
that was sweat!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Hey, look!

KYLE
Dude, we shouldn't be here!

STAN
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect
us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth
graders.

SIXTH GRADER 2
Stupic little Fourthies!  What are you
little Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!


STAN
We've come to... ask you for help.


SIXTH GRADER 2
Help???

KYLE
We need you to protect us... from a
bully.

SIXTH GRADER 2
Yeah? And what do we get for it?

CARTMAN
A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots
& Ladders game used only three times,
DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon
for a free side of fries with a purchase
of any deloxe hamburger at Red Robin.
All this can be yours.

SIXTH GRADER 2
You're gonna have to do better than
that, Fourthies!

KYLE
Well...  Well, what do you want?

SIXTH GRADER 2
You're Stan Marsh, right?

STAN
Yeah.

SIXTH GRADERS
OOOOOoooOoOooo!

SIXTH GRADER 2
We want a picture of your mom's boobs!


SIXTH GRADERS
Yeah. Awesome.

STAN
WHAT??

SIXTH GRADER 3
Your mom has the sweetest bewbs ever.


SIXTH GRADER 4
Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's
tits.

STAN
Dude, weak!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Come back with a naked picture of your
mom!

STAN
NO!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Then we aren't helpin' you!

KYLE
Wait! We'll do it.

SIXTH GRADER 2
It'd have to be a good picture, too!
So long, Fourthies!

CARTMAN
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture
of Stan's mom naked. Cool.

[Sonewhere. Trent makes makeshift barbells out of rods and solid
disks and begins pumping iron]

[South Park, Main Street. A couple and Ms. Claridge pass each
other]

WOMAN 1
That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge.
Poor woman suffered such horrible burns
she can only communicate by... beeping
once for yes and twice for no.

WOMAN 2
Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't
it?

MAN 2
Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge?
Well all right then.

MAN 3
Ms. Claridge, you all right?  You can
talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand:
one beep for yes and two for no. Don't
you think you should get out of the
street?  Look you, you don't have to
be so cold. I'm just trying to help.
Oooo, sorry!

[A doorbell rings. Mrs. Broflovski approaches and opens the door.
Trent faces her with his knife in hand.]

TRENT
Can Kyle come out and play?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.


TRENT
Thank you, ma'am.

[Stan's house. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit at the dining
table. Cartman is dressed as a woman]

STAN
You see, Mom, all the kids at school
were told to bring a picture of their
moms' breasts for anatomy class.

CARTMAN
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully
strange.  You cannot have a picture
of my hot breasts.

STAN
But mom, my teacher will-

CARTMAN
Nononono, you gotta go  "But Mo-o-o-om."


STAN
But Mo-o-o-

CARTMAN
"But Mo-o-o-om."

STAN
This is hopeless!

KYLE
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's
closet and get a picture when she's
changing clothes?

STAN
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a
picture of my mom's boobs!

KENNY
(I'll do it.)

STAN
No, you're not doing it either! We just
need to find something that looks like
boobs to take a picture of.

KYLE
What else has big round squishy globes?


[Living room, moments later. Cartman stands on a stool and squats
down. Kyle has a set of instructions and Stan has a marker. Kenny
stands as a witness]

CARTMAN
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples
like on the bottom of my asscheecks.


KYLE
No, the nipples are more in the middle,
see?

CARTMAN
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means
her nipples... sag more to the bottom
now.

KYLE
How do you know?!

CARTMAN
Will you guys trust me? I know this
stuff!

STAN
All right, fine.

KYLE
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.

KENNY
(Oh yeah!)

KYLE
God I hope this works.

[The ravine, day. The sixth graders are there again, riding up
and down the concrete slopes. Stan and his friends approach]


STAN
Escuse me!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Whattaya want now?!

STAN
We, we got it.

SIXTH GRADER 3
You got a picture of your mom's bewbs?


SIXTH GRADER 5
No way!

SIXTH GRADER 6
Hey, hold on a second!  These are like
the hottest tits I've evern seen!


SIXTH GRADER 7
Whoa!

SIXTH GRADER 8
Check them out!

SIXTH GRADER 2
Give me that!  Whoa! I knew she had
a hot rack!

SIXTH GRADERS
Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

SIXTH GRADER 9
Oh yeah, those are so hot.  Oooohhh


KYLE
Okay, so now you'll help us take care
of Trent Boyett?

SIXTH GRADER 2
Oh all right, we'll let this Trent
Boyett know that if he misses with you,
he's messin' with us!

CARTMAN
All right!

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

CARTMAN
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care
in the world!

KENNY
(All right!)

SIXTH GRADER 10
I need three minutes alone with the
picture behind the bushes.

SIXTH GRADER 6
I get to take the picture behind the
bushes after you.

SIXTH GRADER 2
I'm takin' it to the bushes first!


STAN
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?


KYLE
Naw.

[The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. The boys exit
an ice cream parlor with ice cream cones and walk down the street]


KYLE
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen
the look on Trent Boyett's face when
all the sixth graders showed up!

CARTMAN
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess
with us. I woulda kicked his ass.


STAN
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?
Ms. Claridge?

MAN 4
She won't talk to anybody, boys. Some
say... she's just given up hope.


CARTMAN
Hey guys, you know what we should do?
We should go get a-  Hwuh?!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, later. The boys enter the emergency room
and see it full of cots. The sixth graders are there, some injured
more than others. The emergency room personnel have their hands
full]

DR. DOCTOR
Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many
Indian sunburns and titty twisters in
my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink
belly!

NURSE 1
Doctor, we have another snuggie here


DR. DOCTOR
Over there!  Another wet willie?

NURSE 2
Worst one yet.

SIXTH GRADER
It's all

DR. DOCTOR
Give the poor kid some morphine.

STAN
Dude, what happened?

SIXTH GRADER 2
We... told him not to mess with you
guys... We told him... you paid us.


KYLE
Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!

DR. DOCTOR
Boys, you have to let him rest. Some
mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl


STAN
What's that?

DR. DOCTOR
It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone,
and the anus.  I don't know what kind
of kid would do this to other people;
I only know that I wouldn't ever want
to be on that kid's bad side.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, outside]

STAN
We're dead. Trent knows we send the
sixth-graders after him.

CARTMAN
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.


KYLE
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get
as far away from this town as possible!


STAN
No, no, we've just gotta find better
help.

KYLE
From who? We can't ask adults for help
and there's nobody tougher than sixth
graders.

STAN
There is... one person.

[Stan's house, living room. Shelley is watching TV with a bowl
of soup on her lap. Stan and friends enter and approach]

STAN
Shelley?

SHELLEY
Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!


STAN
Shelley, you're my sister, right? And
families... depend on each other.


SHELLEY
I said shut up, or I will destroy you,
tur-r-rd!

STAN
Shelley  Somebody is going to kill me,
and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help,
so, you're kind of the only person I
have... left.

SHELLEY
STOP CRYING, TURD!! Now, who's gonna
kill you?

STAN
Trent Boyett. He just got released from
Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for
burning Ms. Claridge, but actually,
it was our fault.

SHELLEY
Oh, you are such stupid turds.

STAN
We were only four years old at the time,
uh. We du-we didn't think about the
past coming back to haunt us then. We
didn't think and now he's gonna kill
us!

SHELLEY
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd
is going to kill you. That's my job.


KYLE
So you're gonna help us?

SHELLEY
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in
return.

CARTMAN
A picture of your mom's boobs?

SHELLEY
SHUT UP, TURD! You're going to admit
to Ms. Claridge what you did!

STAN
Admit it was our fault?

SHELLEY
You can't run from your past, turds.
Apologize and make amends. Then I'll
protect you from this Trent turd.


[The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. No one has moved
her. Cars move past her, honking at her, and two men and a woman
approach the corner facing her.]

MAN 5
Ms. Claridge, the people in town are
really worried about you.

WOMAN 5
Look, if you're having some kind of
problem, you have to be able to talk
to people.

MAN 6
Just tell us this: do you trust that
we want what's best for you, yes or
no?

MAN 5
All right, fine! But someday you're
gonna have to learn to let people in!
Bitch.

STAN
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-someting
to tell you.

KYLE
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a
lot of stupid things when we were kids.


CARTMAN
A lot of stupid things that we regret.


KENNY
(And it's time for us to come clean.)


STAN
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little,
we used to play with our weiners a lot,
and one game we played was "Fierman."


TRENT
I've been lookin' for you!  Firve years
I've been waitin' for this day.

CARTMAN
AAAAAAAAH!

STAN
Trent, look: We've realized our mistake!


CARTMAN
Yes, our conscious got the best of us
and, and we were just about to tell
everyone the truth.

TRENT
You had five years to do that. And while
I wasted away my time in prison you've
been enjoying nice, normal lives!


KYLE
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent!
I promise you!

TRENT
Don't tell me that! I heard about the
things you've done! But there WERE no
magical Christmas adventures or talking
poo for me! I didn't get to fight a
huge mechanized Barbra Streisand like
you did! No accidental trips to Afghanistan
for Trent Boyett!

CARTMAN
Stay away from us, Trent!

STAN
What is that?

CARTMAN
It's my mom's taser. I took it from
her purse.  Just back off, man!

TRENT
Look, just take your punishment! You
deserve it! Let me have my retribution
and it can be over with.

CARTMAN
I am NOT going to have a titty twister!
I hate titty twisters!

TRENT
You don't even know how to use that!
Wow!

OFFICER 2
So, Trent, you just had to finish off
your old preschool teacher, eh?

TRENT
No! They did it!

CARTMAN
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.

OFFICER 2
Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this
to you.  Yes yes. Take him away!

TRENT
Naw! You've gotta listen to me!

KYLE
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be
really mad!

CARTMAN
Whatever, that's like five years from
now.

STAN
Yeah, who cares?

THE BOYS
Yeah, woohoo

CARTMAN
We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice
time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa!


SIXTH GRADER 6
Hey, hold on a second!

CARTMAN
Uh oh.

SIXTH GRADER 6
Bewbs!

SIXTH GRADER
Omigod!

SIXTH GRADERS
Boobs!

SIXTH GRADER
I'm taking them to the bushes!

SIXTH GRADER 2
I'm taking them to the bushes first!


CARTMAN
Hah! Hey!

"BUTT OUT"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, gymnasium, day. A school meeting is called
and kids file in. Between two basketball backboards hangs a blue
banner with the words "BUTT OUT!" The O doubles as a no-smoking
symbol. There's plenty of chatter in the gym.]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please?
M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's
about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet

Ohoh, really?? Do you think lung cancer
is cool, too??

RANDY
What about emphysema?? Is that cool??


VERNON
And what about abortion, and AIDS?


RANDY
Pfft! That's none's the cool.

PAM
Word.

VERNON
Yeah. So butt out!

BUTT OUT!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! Give that cigarette
butt a throw!

STAN
Huh, Jesus Christ!

BUTT OUT!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!


VERNON
Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could
grow up to be a failure.

PAN
Worse yet, you could grow up to be dead.


KYLE
So don't believe what those evil tobacco
companies tell you!

RANDY
Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you
can grow up to be-

BUTT OUT!
Just Like Us.

[South Park Elementary, loading area. The boys are there next
to a trash bin, smoking ... and coughing]

STAN
Give me a hit. Give me another one,
give me another one.

KYLE
Aw dude, this is really hard.

CARTMAN
Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey.

KYLE
Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes.
Guys, stop coughing.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Boys, what are you doing back here?
I asked you a question: What are you
doing back here, 'k?!

CARTMAN
Nothing.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
What??

CARTMAN
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing.

KYLE
D'awww sick!

CARTMAN
Gross dude!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well hey, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you boys have been smoking!


CARTMAN
No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have
any cigarettes.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well you'd better not! Because let me
tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh,
smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you
start smokin' at an early age, m'kay,
ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because
uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of
health problems like cancer.  M'kay,
and let me tell you something about
cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay,
and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit!
M'kay?!

MR. SLAVE
Oh! Jethuth Chritht!

STAN
...Woops.

[The Principal's office ...er, the remains, anyway. Only the
door and the desk remain. The bookshelves are burnt up except
for the bottom shelf. The cabinets are charred. The desk is charred
and two of its legs are burnt off]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, you boys have certainly done
it this time!

CARTMAN
We're sorry.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Not as sorry as you're going to be when
your parents get here! Ah, here they
come now.

KYLE
Oh God...

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Come on in.

SHARON
Stanley, what did you do this time?!


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You'd better brace yourself, parents.
The boys were caught... smoking!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Smoking?

SHARON
No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy
smoker!

STAN
Mom...  Dad, it was just a-

RANDY
I don't have a son!

LIANE
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible
things in your life, but smoking? You're
grounded for three weeks!

CARTMAN
Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding
me?

KYLE'S FATHER
Haven't you boys heard anything about
how harmful smoking is to you and those
around you?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Of course they haven't, because the
tobacco companies have gotten to them
first. This is really their fault


KYLE
Yeah. This is really their fault.


KYLE'S MOTHER
No matter how much money the anti-smoking
groups spend, the tobacco companies
are there to fill our childrens' heads
with lies and propaganda that make them
wanna smoke.

CARTMAN
Yeah, huh?  Ih, it's like the tobacco
companies have control of my mind- No.
Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies...
making me want to smoke. Ah!

LIANE
Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are
you okay, sweetie?

RANDY
Well, those God-damned tobacco companies
aren't gonna have control over MY kid!
I say we bring them down!

KYLE'S MOTHER
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking
celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.


KYLE
Who's Rob Reiner?

[Rob Reiner's Smoke Stoppers, day. A blue skyscraper flanked
by two taller blue towers, with the Hollywood sign in the background.
Inside, Rob Reiner speaks to four executives, but he's facing
the window. He's reading from some papers]

ROB REINER
I don't understand it. I pushed a law
for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied
to get images of cigarettes removed
from movies and art, I forced smokers
out of bars and parks, but still I get
letters from parents saying their kids
are doin' it.  Apparently, people still
don't understand hwo bad smoking people
is for them. Don't they know how dangerous
it is to their health?  Don't they know
the hazard of second-hand smoke?

EXECUTIVE 1
According to the letter, sir, the town
has a tobacco company quite near them.


ROB REINER
Yeah, that must be it.  The tobacco
companies, with their millions of dollars
and their slick desks and fancy buildings,
they're the ones making music wanna
smoke!  They're the ones hurting our
nation's health! I will not stand by
and see the children of America corrupted
by those bastards!  This is war!!


Welcome Rob Reiner

[South Park City Hall, day. People have gathered to greet Reiner
when he arrives, and some people have signs saying the same thing
as the banner. Other signs say "THANKS ROB!!", "Welcome MEATHEAD!"
and "Give 'em hell REINER!" Stan and friends wait by the front
door]

KYLE
You guys, maybe we should come clean
right now and tell everyone that it
wasn't the tobacco companies that made
us want to smoke.

STAN
Hwat??

CARTMAN
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming
the tobacco companies, then nobody's
blaming us.

STAN
Yeah, what's the problem?

KYLE
Well it's just that, eh, this seems
like another one of those times when
things are gonna get way out of hands,
you know? It's been happening a lot
lately. How about this time we just
put a stop to it right now?

CARTMAN
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded
for three weeks, do you?

STAN
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't
gonna get out of hand.

MR. GARRISON
Here he comes!

ROB REINER
Damnit.  Butter!  Butter!

MR. GARRISON
What'd he say?

ROB REINER
Butter!!  Hello South Park!!  It is
so nice to see an entire town come together
to fight for good health! And I'm gonna
help ya!  These poor innocent children
have been seduced into smoking tobacco.
So I say, "We fight fire with fire!"
We're gonna use these children to bring
the tobacco companies down!

KYLE
Oh no...

[The town bar. Reiner sits at a booth with the boys, feverishly
eating. A waitress comes up with a platter of cheeseburgers and
fries.]

ROB REINER
All right kids, here's what we're gonna
do.  We're gonna sneak you into the
tobacco company by saying you kids want
a tour for a school paper.  Once you're
nside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos
and then we'll publish them, saying
that the tobacco company invited you
over to seduce you into smoking. Got
it?

CARTMAN
Got it!

KYLE
But... isn't that, kind of, lying?


ROB REINER
Mm.  Uh, we're just leveling out the
playing field.  The tobacco companies
lie to you about the dangers of smoking.
If we're gonna take them down, we've
gotta lie right back!  Oh my God!  Excuse
me!

BUDS MAN
Yes?

ROB REINER
Would you mind putting that death stick
out?!

BUDS MAN
But, uh, this is a bar.

ROB REINER
Isn't smoking illegal in bars here?


BARTENDER
Not in Colorado

ROB REINER
Oh my God! What kind of backward hick
state is this?!

BUDS MAN
Look man, I work fourteen hours a day
at the saw mill. I just got off work
and I need to relax.

ROB REINER
Well when I relax I just go to my vacation
house in Hawaii!

BUDS MAN
I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii!


ROB REINER
Yuh your vacation house in Mexico, then,
whatever it is! Look, you are putting
my life and these boys' lives in danger
by smoking that in here! And I'm not
gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking
in bars in Colorado! There will be no
more smoking here!

[Back at the table...]

CARTMAN
Isn't he awesome, you guys?

KYLE
What??

CARTMAN
Dude, he just goes around imposing his
will on people. He's my idol.

[Big Tobacco Co., day. Reiner and the boys approach the front
door.]

ROB REINER
All right boys, just do what I tell
ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco
company for two billion dollars!  As
soon as we get into the mani facility,
I'll snap the photo of you kids, and
we can all run out! Think you can handle
it?

CARTMAN
Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd
handle my grandpa's balls, sir.

ROB REINER
Heh, great.  Okay, now watch yourselves,
kids. These tobacco company people will
do anything to get you hooked on smoking.
They are liars and they are frauds!


[Big Tobacco Co., headquarters. A door opens and closes.]

RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?

ROB REINER
Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called
about my boys wanting a tour.

EXECUTIVE
Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin
Harris and I'm the vice president of
Big Tobacco.

ROB REINER
Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.

KEVIN HARRIS
Well, come on in.  How about a little
history first?  Native Americans were
the first to cultivate the tobacco plant.
They smoked it in pipes for medicinal
and ceremonial purposes.

ROB REINER
Not if I were around, they wouldn't
have.

KEVIN HARRIS
Escuse me?

ROB REINER
Oh, nothing! Please continue.

KEVIN HARRIS
The first successful commercial crop
of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia
in 1612.  Within seven years it was
one of the country's largest exports.


KYLE
So, tobacco helped to build America.


KEVIN HARRIS
That's right. Over the next few centuries
the tobacco business was so great that
many slaves were brought from Africa
to help work the fields.

CARTMAN
Which means, if it weren't for tobacco,
many of our black friends wouldn't be
here today.

KEVIN HARRIS
And so for centuries, tobacco production
flourished. Nobody was even aware of
any dangers back then, until, in 1965,
when Congress passed an act forcing
all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon
General's warning on their packages.
So now, everyone knows the dangers of
smoking. And some people still choose
to do it, and we believe that's what
being an American is all about.

KYLE
That sound perfectly reasonable.

KEVIN HARRIS
And here's our factory at work.

FACTORY WORKERS
With a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey
lidey lay

We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day

So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives

And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night

YOUNG WORKER
I like to have a cigarehette every now
and then

It makes me fee-l calmer when the day is at an end. [hops onto
the wheelbarrow and rides away]

OLDER WORKER
And if it gives me cancer when I'm eighty
I don't care

Who the hell wants to be ninety anyway?

FACTORY WORKERS
So with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey
lidey lay

We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day

So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives

And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night

KEVIN HARRIS
Well, I guess that's the end of our
tour.

ROB REINER
Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture.
Got it! Ha! You bastards are going
down now!

KEVIN HARRIS
What??

ROB REINER
I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner!
And you've just been Reinered! Come
on boys, let's make our escape!  Don't
you try and stop us!

KEVIN HARRIS
Oh my God!

[Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, night. Reiner and the boys
arrive]

ROB REINER
Hoh boy, that was great, kids.

STAN
Those people at the tobacco company
all seem really nice.

ROB REINER
Hah, you see that? They got into your
head. Now you kids can meet some good,
decent people, the folks who work to
get smoking banned!

[Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, interior. The workers there
walk around like zombies, or Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's helper.
They make grunts as they pass each other. The woman runs off
and the man chases after her.]

ROB REINER
This is how we get rid of smokers.
We go state to state and do things
like, use bogus studies and make extensive
commercials to get the public on our
side and force cigarette smokers to
stop!

CARTMAN
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings
a lot of people just a little bit of
joy and, and you get to take that away
from them.  You are so awesome.

ROB REINER
Here you go Bob.  This is Mr. Baffrey.
He does all our Photoshop work.  Now,
all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes
into your hands!  And bingo! When this
hits the papers the tobacco company
is screwed! Hahahaha!

KYLE
But dude, you're making stuff up.

ROB REINER
You kids need to understand something,
okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like,
when you know what's good for people
more than they do.

CARTMAN
Oh my God, that is what I've always
said.  I love this guy!

WORKER
Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking
outlawed at bars here didn't pass.


ROB REINER
What?!  God-damnit, what the hell is
wrong with people in this state?!


WORKER
Apparently, several people here still
believe there's no proof second-hand
smoke can kill you.

ROB REINER
Well they want proof?! All right, we'll
give them proof! Boys, I need one of
you to act in a commercial for us! We'll
shoot it tomorrow!

CATMAN
Wow, a commercial?

ROB REINER
And you boys decide which one of you
will be best for the part. All right
people, we've gotta get moving on the
bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's
go!

CARTMAN
God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner,
can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold
drink, perhaps?

[Outside the tent. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny rush out of there and
stop some distance away from it]

KYLE
Guys, I thnk we shold bail out of this
right now!

STAN
Huh?

KYLE
This is just startin' to look like another
one of those times where it, it's gonna
end up with the whole town turning out,
it's a big showdown happening, and us
havin' to talk about what we learned,
and I say we just stop right now, and
go play cards or something.

KENNY
(Well yep, that's what I think.)

STAN
Yeah, maybe you're right.

CARTMAN
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one
of us gets to be in the commercial,
huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the
game is on!

KYLE
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their
stupid commercial.

CARTMAN
Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your
Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think
you don't care about being in the commercial
so that maybe I won't either. Ooops.
didn't work, did it, Kyle?

KYLE
No, we really want nothing more to do
with these people.

CARTMAN
Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither
do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say
next. You're gonna say, "How about none
of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And
then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow
you can waltz in all by yourself and
do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew
double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work
on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us
can be in the commecial, gentlemen.
The game... is on.

[Kyle's house, night. Cartman climbs up to the second story and
opens a window at the end of the hallway. He carries with him
a bunch of lumber, a hammer, and some nails. He approaches Kyle's
door and gets to work hammering the lumber in place over the
door]

CARTMAN
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one
of us will be showing up to do the comemrcial
tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had
me with your Serbian Jew double bluff,
didn't you?! Well let's see you try
to open this door now.  Hahahahaha!
Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha-


KYLE
What are you doing?

CARTMAN
Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.Wait, this
isn't my house.

KYLE
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial
tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those
anti-smoking people are liars and they're
bullies who will stop at nothing to
get what they want, and that means they're
dangerous.

CARTMAN
Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's
see you try to get through the door
now! Haa haa hahahahaha!

[Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, day. Cartman is at the photo
shoot getting makeup, being prepped for the shot]

ROB REINER
Okay Eric, this is going to be real
simple. All you gotta do is read the
words on the TelePrompTer here.

CARTMAN
Heh, ho-okay.

ROB REINER
Let's see how the tobacco companies
deal with this.  All right, roll camera.
Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever
you're ready, Eric.

CARTMAN
Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people
say there's no proof that second-hand
smoke kills. The tobacco companies say
there's no proof that second-hand smoke
kills. I've just been diagnosed with
terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm
the proof. The next time you want to
believe that second-hand smoke doesn't
kill, think about me. Because, by the
time you see this commercial, I'll be...
dead.  Dead??

ROB REINER
And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up,
people. That was fantastic.

CARTMAN
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll
be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that
"dead" part?

SCARY ASSISTANT
That was very good, Eric. Here, eat
this cupcake.

CARTMAN
Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.

SCARY ASSISTANT
But you are. Just eat this one cupcake.
It has... sprinkles.

CARTMAN
I'm not eating the cupcake.

ROB REINER
Eric, do you know what a hero is? A
hero is somebody who sacrifices himself
for the good of others. Youc an be a
hero, Eric. All you have to do... is
eat the cupcake.

CARTMAN
Jesus Christ! HAAAA!

ROB REINER
Hey!

[Stan's house. The other boys are in the dining room playing
cards. Cartman opens the door, runs in, and closes it quick.
He then goes to a window and looks to see if he's being followed]


STAN
What are you doing, Cartman?

CARTMAN
They're going to kill me!

KYLE
Who's going to kill you?

CARTMAN
The anti-smoking people! They had me
say I died from second-hand smoke and...
now they want to sacrifice me to make
it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!


STAN
Well, get away from us then.

KYLE
Yeah dude, don't get us killed too.


CARTMAN
You guys have to help me!

KYLE
No dude, get away!

CARTMAN
Please, you guys, I don't know what
to do!

STAN
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!


CARTMAN
If I go, you guys go!

STAN
Daaaad!

RANDY
What?

STAN
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill
Cartman and he won't stay away from
us.

RANDY
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking
people are kind, caring, and intelligent.
Your heads have just been corrupted
by the lies of the big tobacco companies.


CARTMAN
Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe
the tobacco company can help us!


STAN
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the
commercial, remember?

KYLE
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!


CARTMAN
Well that's fine. I thought you guys
were my friends, but I guess I was wrong!


KYLE
Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.


KENNY
(Uh huh.)

CARTMAN
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed
off heah! Now come on, we're goin' to
the tobacco company.

STAN
Oh all right.

KYLE
No! What we really should do is go to
our parents right now and take responsibility
for smoking ourselves. Even if it means
getting grounded.

STAN
Why?

KYLE
Because, if we go to the tobacco company,
I know exactly what'll happen. They'll
take us in, and then Rob Reiner will
show up with all the townspeople, holding
torches or something, and there'll be
a big showdown until we talk about what
we learned, and change everyone's minds
- this is all following a formula!


STAN
So it's either deal with all that, or
be grounded for three weeks.

[Big Tobacco Co., night. The town arrives with all the townspeople
carrying torches and clamoring.]

KYLE
God-damnit!

ROB REINER
Give us the child!

KEVIN HARRIS
We will not!

ROB REINER
There, you see that?! The tobacco company
won't give us the kid! And do you know
why?! Because they know that if they
give us that kid, then we'll kill him!
And when our commercial goes on the
air, it will lose them business!

TOWNSPEOPLE
Yeah! Yeah, that's right!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Wait a minute, what?

ROB REINER
Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are
gonna think it's because of second-hand
smoke! And then these bastards are all
gonna make money, and they know it!


RANDY
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you?
That's not right.

ROB REINER
Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain
this again?! Smoking is bad, people!
So if we have to be a little extreme
to stop it, it's okay!

KYLE
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because,
I've learned something today. You just
hate-  See, I knew it.

STAN
Yup.

KYLE
You just hate smoking, so you use all
your money and power to force others
to think like you. And that's called
fascism, you tubby asshole!

ROB REINER
GOD-DAMNIT THERE'LL BE NO MORE SMOKING!!


STAN
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault
that we smoked. It was our fault, us!
We should all take personal responsibility
instead of letting fat fascists like
him tell us what to do!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
You're right, boys, m'kay?

BUDS MAN
Yeah. Let smokers smoke.

TOWNSPEOPLE
Yeah!!

MR. GARRISON
Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out!


ROB REINER
I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking
groups!

CARTMAN
I don't idolize you anymore, asshole!


ROB REINER
My goo! My precious goo!

KYLE'S MOTHER
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company
that made you wanna smoke?

KYLE
No.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well then, you are grounded, mister!


LIANE
You too, Eric.

CARTMAN
Aw awww!

[Added in later showings of the episode.]

STAN
Well, I guess we learned our lesson.


KYLE
No we didn't, dude! No we didn't!


THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 704


"I'M A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings. The fourth graders
are still chatting as Mr. Garrison enters.]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats.
Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?


MR. SLAVE
All donesy wunsy.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, let's all take out our math homework
and go over the problems.

CARTMAN
Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where
did I file that?

MR. GARRISON
Oh, and by the way, children, there's
a walkout scheduled today to protest
the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against
the war, run along outside, and if you're
for the war, uh, stay here and we'll
do math problems.

[South Park Elementary, front entrance. The door open and all
the kids run out. A cloud of paper signals their exit. Some of
them twirl with delight. The boys come out singing]

THE BOYS
We got out of schoo-l! No more school
toda-ay!

KYLE
What should we do?

STAN
Let's go see a movie!

PROTESTERS
No war! No war!  No war! No war!  No
war! No war!  No war! No war! No war!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh
uh, here you go, boys.  These will help
you protest. It's good to see that you
care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war,
m'kay?!

A VOICE
Excuse me, boys.  Tom Stansel, HBC news.
Can you kids tell me why you marched
out of school today?

STAN
Uh... war?

TOM
Right. What about the war?

KYLE
Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?

TOM
Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you
think is most gay?

KYLE
Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.

STAN
Yeah.  War is not my voice.

CARTMAN
Bush is a Naizi

SKEETER
Hey all you unAmerican bastards! If
you don't like America, why don't you
git out?!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Don't you call us unAmerican! This country
was founded on the right to protest!
M'kay?

PROTESTERS
Yeah! Right!

STUART
If the Founding Fathers saw you burning
your flag an' callin' the President
a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!


SUPPORTERS
Yeah! Right!

RANDY
The Founding Fathers would agree with
our right to protest!

SKEETER
Foundin' Fathers would kick all your
asses!

TOM
Boys, what do you think the Founding
Fathers would say?

CARTMAN
...Eh the... Founding who?

[South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. He stares at the
children angrily, his arms crossed]

MR. GARRISON
Well, I hope you little Commies are
pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going
out there and protesting America, and
then saying on national television that
you don't even know who the Founding
Fathers are! You kids don't know squat
about America, do you?!

BUTTERS
Mmuh well, not really, no.

MR. GARRISON
Well that's just jingles! Because I'm
assigning all you little flag-burners
a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix,
and the Founding Fathers!

CLASS
Awwwwww!

MR. GARRISON
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study
groups of four, and if you can't give
an outstanding report on what the Founding
Fathers would have to say about all
this protesting, then it's Fs for you!


CARTMAN
Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is
waaay too much material for a nine-year-old!


KYLE
Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time
we get put in a study group, you sit
on your ass while the rest of us do
all the work!

CARTMAN
But you guys are such better studiers
than me. I know you can pull it off.


STAN
You're gonna read this stuff and study
like the rest of us!

CARTMAN
Maaaa. M-maaaa.

KYLE
Shut up and study!

CARTMAN
Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When
our Founding Fathers created America.
I wonder what it used to be like in
those days?  In those days? In those
days? In those days?

KYLE
What are you doing?

CARTMAN
I'm trying to have a flashback.

KENNY
(A what?)

CARTMAN
You know. If I have a flashback, then
I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!


STAN
No, you just have to study.

CARTMAN
Nonono. I've seen this work before.
Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay.
How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so
long ago. I wonder what life would have
been like back then?  Back then? Back
then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait,
I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys,
I don't even care about 1776. It was
so long ago, that I don't think it has
anything to do with me.  With me. With...
anything to do with me. With me.

KYLE
That isn't gonna work, dumbass!

MR. SLAVE
Kids, let's keep it down for study group,
or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish
me.

STAN
Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna
have to study!

CARTMAN
Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!

[South Park Avenue. The opposing groups face each other in front
of the tallest building in town. Skeeter paints a line across
the span of the street and looks up]

SKEETER
There! All finished. From now on, this
is the pro-war side of town, and that's
the unpatriotic side.

RANDY
How about we call this the rational
side of town, and that the redneck side?!


PROTESTERS
Hahahaha, yeah.

JIMBO
You just keep all your flag burnin'
and your hippie-rock protest songs on
YOUR side o' the town!

PROTESTER
Hey wait a minute, your side of town
has the post office.

STUART
Well your side has the grocery store.


JIMBO
Well you can come to our side of town
to use the post office and we can go
to your side to use the grocery store.


KYLE'S FATHER
Aaah, can we cross the line to take
our kids to school?

JIMBO
W-hell, naturally you could cross the
line for that. Just like ...we could
cross the line for hardware, supplies,
gas, and pharmaceutical needs.

TOWNSFOLK
Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.


SKEETER
Hey everybody, this is never going to
work. Don't you see? All this dividin'
up the town, it's just ridiculous. What
we really should be doing, is just beatin'
the hell out of each other like we were.


RANDY
He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool.


[Cartman's house, upstairs. The boys walk down the hallway and
reach Cartman's room. He's rigged up a way to ... knock himself
out. Three pulley wheels and a nail guide a string tied to the
door across the entrance, up the wall, and back to the top of
the door entrance. At the other end of the string is a big rock.]


KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
You're suppsoed to be studying!

CARTMAN
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to
find out all about what happened back
in 1776.

STAN
How?!

CARTMAN
All I have to do is be thinking about
American history when I walk through
this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing
the rock to fall on my head. And then
I will have a flashback to the times
of our Founding Fathers!

KYLE
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged
retard!

CARTMAN
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle!
But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen,
if you will clear the doorway, please?
Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be
like in the year 1776.

KYLE
Cartman? Cartman??

CARTMAN
Benjamin Franklin?

KYLE
No, turdpants, it's Kyle!

CARTMAN
Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you
God-damned Jew!

[City Hall, day. Both sides of the war issue are in the office.]


TOWNSFOLK
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Okay, people. What are we rabbling about
now?

RANDY
Mayor, our peace rally has always been
set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war
bastards are suddenly trying to say
they get the town square.

SKEETER
That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to
support the war was set up months ago!


KYLE'S FATHER
There was no war months ago!

SKEETER
Hey, if you don't like America, then
you can git out!

RANDY
Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of
twangy country music prowar proopaganda!


STUART
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o'
rock protest songs!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well up yours, rednecks!

TOWNSFOLK
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Quiet people! The town square is public
space. That means if neither group will
nicely and maturely move the day of
its rally, I'll just have have to give
the town square to both groups.

JIMBO
All right, that's fine! Because our
war support songs will be a thousand
times better!

RANDY
Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!


SKEETER
We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the
hizzle!

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna
sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!


[Cartman's house, night. The front door opens and in walk the
boys.]

STAN
Cartman?

KYLE
Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit!


CARTMAN
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in
time.

STAN
Oh no...

CARTMAN
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back
to the days of our Foundig Fathers!


KYLE
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying!
What the hell is all this?!

CARTMAN
I have programmed TiVo to record over
fifty hours of the History channel.
When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will
be dropped into the water, combining
our electrowhatever fields and sending
me into a flashback of history!

STAN
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really
bad idea.

CARTMAN
Or a really sweet one.

TIVO
Your TiVo is full.

CARTMAN
Whoa, here it goes!

KYLE
Cartman?  Cartman??

STAN
Aww crap.

[The flashback. Cartman is seen in period dress, face down on
a dirt road. He comes to, looks up, sits up and looks around,
then notices his clothes. He quickly rises and looks at Philadelphia
in the distance.]

CARTMAN
Ohhh awesome!!!

DRIVER
Worthy young lad, are you all right?


CARTMAN
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year
it is?

DRIVER
This year? Why it's 1776, it is.

CARTMAN
Oho yes! I did it I did it!

DRIVER
Would you like a ride into town? I'm
on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's
hosue to get a very important document,
I am.

CARTMAN
Oho kick fucking ass, dude!

DRIVER
Never seen you around here, friend.
Might you be from up North?

CARTMAN
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having
a flashback.

DRIVER
A flashback? Why, what is that?

CARTMAN
Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome!


Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.

With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses
made of bricks.

What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me

I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.


Seriuosly hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room. Cartman's
mom sits by his bed as Stan and Kyle look on. Dr. Doctor enters]


LIANE
Is he going to be all right, doctor??


DR. DOCTOR
Your son tried to kill himself in a
ritualistic fashion I've never seen
before. His chances of surviving are
very slim. I'm so sorry.

LIANE
Oh baby baby, you can't die.

KYLE
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole!
Get up! Get up!!

LIANE
Whoa. Easy, Kyle.

KYLE
But it's not fair! We have to do a full
report on the Founding Fathers, and
Cartman got out of helping us again!


STAN
I gues we're just gonna have to do it
with the three of us! Come on, guys!


LIANE
I know you're in a very dark place now,
sweetie. But you must come toward the
light! Come toward the light!

[Flashback, night. The driver and Cartman approach Jefferson's
house.]

DRIVER
Here we are, then. The current residence
of Master Thomas Jefferson.

CARTMAN
Super neato!

DRIVER
I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.


CARTMAN
But, I need to talk to the Founding
Fathers to do my report.

DRIVER
Sorry. Only the official messenger boy
is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson


CARTMAN
Oh, okay.I guess I understand.  I don't
wanna wait for our life to be over...
I don't wanna wait for our life to
be over...

JEFFERSON
Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.

CARTMAN
And I am the official messenger boy,
I am.

JEFFERSON
Very well. Take this document to the
Continental Congress.

CARTMAN
Wow, the Declaration of Independence
Day.

JEFFERSON
Some favir going to war with England
and others want to avoid war at all
cost.

CARTMAN
It's a bitch, ain't it?

JEFFERSON
Perhaps this document will make the
reasons for war obvious to all. Good
luck, young messenger!  Now make haste!


[Stan's house, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny study at the coffee
table in the living room]

STAN
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the
Declaration of Independence, then the
Continental Congress-

PROTESTERS
No war! No war! No war!

KYLE
Oh, Jesus...

RANDY
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the
living room. We have to practice our
big war protest song.

STAN
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison
is making us do a presentation on what
the Founding Fathers would say about
the war.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Hey... That's a terrific idea!

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah! We could have the boys do their
presentation as part of our peace rally
on Saturday!

STAN
Oh, no, nononono.

SUPPORTERS
Support our troops! Support our troops!
Support our troops!

SKEETER
See? I told you they had your son.


STUART
Kenny. What are you doing over here
with all these unAmerican traitors?!


KENNY
(I'm doing my homework.)

RANDY
The boys are going to give a presentation
at our rally about how the Founding
Fathers would agree with our right to
protest!

STAN
Actually, we hadn't really come to a
decision-

STUART
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES
his country!  Come on, Kenny!

KENNY
(But Dad, I-)

STUART
NOW!

SKEETER
Yeah!

SUPPORTERS
Support our troops! Support our troops!
Support our troops! Support our troops!


STAN
Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we
lost two in our study group!

KYLE
God damnit!

RANDY
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches?
Manipulating those kids to be on their
side.

KYLE'S FATHER
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up
to you to show all those war-mongerers
that the Founding Fathers agree with
us!

PROTESTER 1
Yeah, that's right!

PROTESTER 2
Come on, guys!

PROTESTER 3
Get back to work!

KYLE
Do you think kids in every town have
to deal with this crap?

[Philadelphia, day. Independence Hall is shown. Cartman enters
and finds the Congress room. The doors open before him]

A VOICE
Enter, young messenger.  I am John Hancock,
President of the Congress.

CARTMAN
Wow.

HANCOCK
Mr. John Adams?

ADAMS
Aye.

HANCOCK
Will you do the honors of reading the
document to Congress, please?

ADAMS
WHEN in the Course of human Events,
it becomes necessary for one People
to rise up-  -we mutually pledge to
each other our Lives, our Fortunes,
and our sacred Honor.


P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day. [rolls up
the Declaration. Cartman looks around]

A CONGRESSMAN
Excuse me, but does this Declaration
actually suggest that we should go to
go war with England?

ADAMS
We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson.


[South Park, day. The town square stage. On stage are decorations
for the two sides. On the left is a large peace sign on a green
curtain surrounded by peace signs and protest signs, on the right
is a large eagle surrounded by yellow ribbons. Both groups are
on stage]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
All right everyone, thank you all for
comin' out to protest the war, m'kay?
.

SKEETER
Don't kid yourselves. These people have
come out to support our troops, right?!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a
protest song he wrote about the war.


SKEETER
Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war
song first!

JIMBO
Yeah! The last thing these people want
is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!


MAYOR MCDANIELS
People, I told you, you have to share
the stage.

RANDY
Nobody wants to here another pro-war
country song!

SKEETER
Well excuse me if...

I'm a little bit country.

RANDY
Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll!


SKEETER
I'm a little for supportin' our troops.


RANDY
And I'm a little for bringin' them home.


SKEETER
I believe freedom isn't free.

RANDY
No, but war shouldn't be our goal.


SKEETER
We must defend our country.

RANDY
If it means war, then we say NO!

SOMEBODY
Yeehaw!

SKEETER


Did you forget them towers in New York?

Did you forget how it made you feel

To see them towers come down?

Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?

RANDY
I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock
Iraq!

The only kind of rockin' America should do is the kind that we
can all dance to, yeah!

SKEETER
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned
lead.

We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch
will be dead.

RANDY
Why are we fightin' this war?

There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.

They didn't give me a choice.

War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!

[Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument
going on]

ADAMS
We must go to war!

DICKINSON
But what about the violence?! The lives
lost?! If we found a country, it should
be founded on peace and diplomacy.


CONGRESSMAN 1
England will only understand one thing:
Force.

CONGRESSMAN 2
I must state again for the record that
South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and Georgia are against war!


CONGRESSMAN 3
Yeah, because you don't care about the
fate of the Colonies like we do! You're
all unpatriotic! And if you don't like
the Colonies, then you can git out!


DICKINSON
Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're
protesting this war because we care
so deeply for the fate of our Colonies!
You are all unpatriotic for leading
the Colonies into a war that half of
them don't want!

CARTMAN
Whoa, how very very relevant.

[South Park, day, town square. The rally is still going on, and
a reporter files the following report]

TOM
Tom, I'm standing in the town square
where the war rally has been going on
for an incredible eighty-seven hours.
The crowd still appears to be split
right down the middle - half of them
support country music, and the other
half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
And now we'd like to bring out a couple
of very special South Park students
who did a report on what the Founding
Fathers would have to say about the
war.

PROTESTERS
Booooo!!

RANDY
For you people who still think war
is the answer, perhaps you can listen
to the voices ... of the children.


STAN
Uh, we didn't do it.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
What?

KYLE
We didn't do our homework.

SHARON
Boys! You were supposed to come out
here and tell everyone about the Founding
Fathers!

STAN
Well, first we lost one study partner
when Cartman put himself in the hospital,
and then they took Kenny away, and then
Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for
Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find
anything in the history books about
Iraq and then-

SKEETER
That's because the Founding Fathers
would have supported the war!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
The Founding Fathers would have protested
like us!

SUPPORTERS
Support!

PROTESTERS
Protest!

SUPPORTERS
Country!

PROTESTERS
Rock-n-roll!

[the two sides charge at each other on stage, then off stage.
They attack each other with their signs. One man drives his "War
is not my voice" sign straight down into another man's head.
A man drives his "Bush is a Nazi" sign up a woman's nose after
she swats him with her "Support Your Troops" sign. A woman strikes
someone else down with her "No Blood for Oil" sign. Stan and
Kyle just look on]

[Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument
still going on]

CONGRESSMEN
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!


DICKINSON
We cannot found a country based on war!


ADAMS
We cannot found a country that is afraid
to fight!

CONGRESSMAN
Rabble!

CONGRESSMEN
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble
Rabble!  Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin.
It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin
Franklin.

CARTMAN
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin
Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.


HANCOCK
Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on
the war issue?

FRANKLIN
I believe that if we are to form a new
country, we cannot be a country that
appears war-hungry and violent to the
rest of the world. However, we also
cannot be a country that appears weak
and unwilling to fight to the rest of
the world. So, what if we form a country
that appears to want both?

JEFFERSON
Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and
protest going to war at the same time.


DICKINSON
Right. If the people of our new country
are allowed to do whatever they wish,
then some will support the war and some
will protest it.

FRANKLIN
And that means that as a nation, we
could go to war with whomever we wished,
but at the same time, act like we didn't
want to. If we allow the people to protest
what the government does, then the country
will be forever blameless.

ADAMS
It's like having your cake, and eating
it, too.

CONGRESSMAN 2
Think of it: an entire nation founded
on saying one thing and doing another.


HANCOCK
And we will call that country the United
States of America.

CARTMAN
Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa,
here it goes. I wish I could go back
to my time. To my time, to, to my time.


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's room. Cartman comes to
and looks around]

CARTMAN
Wow!

[South Park, town square. The townsfolk are still attacking each
other and killing more of their number. One man kills another
with a "PEACE NOW" sign. A war supporter runs a flag pole through
a protester, then pulls it back out again. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny
watch from the other end of the square, towards the stage as
the carnage continues]

CARTMAN
Everyone, stop! Please!

TOWNSMAN
The-the child! The child, from the hospital.


CARTMAN
If you all don't mind, I would like
to do my report now. I know what the
founding fathers would say.

STAN
He does?

KYLE
He does?

CARTMAN
I learned somethin' today. This country
was founded by some of the smartest
thinkers the world has ever seen. And
they knew one thing: that a truely great
country can go to war, and at the same
time, act like it doesn't want to.
You people who are for the war, you
need the protesters. Because they make
the country look like it's made of sane,
caring individuals. And you people who
are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers,
because, if our whole country was made
up of nothing but soft pussy protesters,
we'd get taken down in a second. That's
why the founding fathers decided we
should have both. It's called "having
your cake and eating it too."

RANDY
He's right. The strength of this country
is the ability to do one thing and say
another.

SKEETER
Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you
guys protesting, why everyone around
the world would hate the American people
instead of just the President.

KYLE'S FATHER
And if it weren't for you people flexing
your arms, America could easily get
taken over by terrorists or... or China.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
I guess we... owe you an apology.

STUART
Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.

TOWNSFOLK
Awww.

KYLE
Cartman? Cartman saved the day?

STAN
Can't be

CARTMAN
The Founding Fathers want you all to
know that we can disagree all we want,
as long as we agree that America kicks
ass.

SKEETER
Hey I'm a little bit country

RANDY
And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-eh


SKEETER
I'll be the muscle of America

RANDY
And me, I'll be the caring soul.

TOGETHER
When you put us together you get a nation
with one goal

To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.


RANDY
Come on up here, everybody!

EVERYBODY
We're a little bit country, and we're
a little bit rock-n-roll

STUART
We can be a nation that believe in war,


COUNSELOR MACKEY
And still tells the world that we don't.


EVERYBODY
Let the flag for hyprocisy fly high
from every pole

We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll


RANDY
Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has
been great bringing you a hundred episodes.


SKEETER
We want to thank our guests, the pro-war
people.  And the anti-war people.


STAN
What the hell are they doing now?

KYLE
Ah I don't know.

EVERYBODY
For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES??
One hundred episodes!

KYLE
I hate this town. Ah I really really
do.

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 707


"RED MAN'S GREED"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Three Feathers Casino, night. People flock in. The building
is massive, the front entrance is prefaced with a long pool with
water jets shooting water into the air. The interior is shown,
with its slot machines and milling crowds. The boys enter with
the Marshes and the Broflovskis. Randy and Gerald carry cigars
in their hands]

STAN
Wow, dude.

CARTMAN
Man, Indians have it good, huh?

RANDY
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans,
remember? Show some respect.

CARTMAN
All right, let's go!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go
onto the casino floor.

CARTMAN
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see
a shovel in my hand?!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
You kids can enjoy our Native American
Comedy Club.

KYLE'S FATHER
All right, we're gonna hit the tables.
Why don't you kids run along to the
comedy club?

RANDY
All right, time to win some money!


KYLE'S FATHER
Oh yeah! blackjack table!

BLACKJACK DEALER
Welcome to the blackjack table. May
luck run through you, like the spirit
of the buffalo.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!


KYLE'S FATHER
Relax, sweetie  I know how to count
cards.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well I don't wanna play here!

SHARON
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the
nickle slots.

RANDY
Oooo, the nickle slots! You might win
the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women,
huh? God I hate 'em.

KYLE'S FATHER
All right, time to show these people
how to gamble!

[An entrance is shown - The Laughing Coyote Comedy Lodge, then
the interior of the lodge itself. A Native American drummer sits
on stage.]

ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy
Club. Please put your hands together
for Johnny Manymoons!

KYLE
What is Native American comedy, anyway?


MANYMOONS
Thank you, thank you. Bear walked into
a bar. Bear said to Deer, "May I please...
have a drink?" And so Deer said to Bear,
"Why the big paws?"

AUDIENCE
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

MANYMOONS
Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked
up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, "I
am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell
at him for me?" Coyote said to Pony,
"Why can you not yell yourself?" And
Pony replied, "Because I am a little
horse."

AUDIENCE
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

[The blackjack table. Gerald sits alone fiddling with some chips.
Randy returns from somewhere with a cup of coins]

RANDY
How's it goin', Gerald?

KYLE'S FATHER
Ohh, not so good.

RANDY
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down
three hundred bucks.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.


RANDY
Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait.
Twenty-six thousand dollars??

KYLE'S FATHER
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling
problem.

RANDY
Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!

KYLE'S FATHER
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before
Sheila finds out!

RANDY
Where did you get that kind of money??


KYLE'S FATHER
The casino gave me credit! I put the
house up as collateral! But I still
have this ten-dollar chip.

BLACKJACK DEALER
Dealer, twenty one.  Sorry.

KYLE'S FATHER
That's it. I'm destitute.  Loan me
money! You've gotta have money in the
cup!  Wha- what's in the cup?

RANDY
Just six quarters!

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh God. Oh Jesus.

BLACKJACK DEALER
Thank you for playing at Three Feathers.
May your life be filled with the song
of the sparrow.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up
your ass!

[Three Bears Casino, sometime later. Randy and Gerald sit on
a bench next to some slot machines. Gerald's head hangs low]


KYLE'S FATHER
How am I going to tell my family?  How
do I tell them that tomorrow, we have
to ...pack up our things and ...get
out of the house?

KYLE'S MOTHER
There's daddy!

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, Jesus.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Where have you guys been? We've been
looking all over.

KYLE
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks.
I wanna go.

KYLE'S FATHER
What, What did you say?

KYLE
I said I wanna leave.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine,
Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack
up our things, load them in the car,
and we'll leave!

KYLE
What?? No, no, I mean, I-

KYLE'S FATHER
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South
Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, what are you talking about?


KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants
to leave! Our nice old house doesn't
interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm callig
the moving company right now!

CARTMAN
Well, you shouldn't be such a dick,
dude.

SHARON
What's wrong with Gerald?

RANDY
He... he lost his house to the Native
Americans.

SHARON
What?? But don't the Native Americans
know he has nowhere else to go?

RANDY
They don't care.

[The casino office. Chief Runs with Premise looks out over the
floor]

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring
their life-savings away!

ELDER 1
Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea
from the buffalo.

ELDER 2
Yes, but we have milked this simple
mountain folk almost dry. If we really
want to see cash flow, we need to bring
in city people from Denver.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Yeessss. It is time for us to implement
our plan.  A superhighway, built from
Denver right to our casino!

AIDE 1
And what do we do about the small town
of South Park that lies in the highway's
way?

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Simple. We buy it, and we demolish
it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!

ELDERS
Ha ha ha ha!

[South Park Elementary, next day. A town meeting is being held
in the gym. Mayor McDaniels sits at a table with four aides,
two on either side of her.]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
And that's really all I can tell you.
The town of South Park is going to be
leveled, in order to make way for a
twelve-lane superhighway.

RANDY
But how can they do that?!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
The Native Americans have purchased
the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're
buying the last of what they need to
have complete ownership.

JIMBO
Well can't we stop them? Let's call
the bank.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
The Native Americans bought the bank.


MR. GARRISON
Oh my God.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The
Native Americans are offering you retail
values on your homes.

RANDY
No, screw that! We'll just pool our
money together and buy the town ourselves!


CHEF
Yeah! Let the South Park people own
South Park!

RANDY
How much do we have to raise, Mayor?


MAYOR MCDANIELS
Three hundred thousand dollars.

RANDY
Ohhh, never mind.

BUTTERS
How can they do that, huh? How can they
make us all move away?

CARTMAN
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!


KYLE
Native Americans.

STAN
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such
great times here.

[stops reminiscing, turns around, and walks back to the boys]
We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop
those Native Americans!

THE BOYS
Yeah!

ALEX
Yeah, this is our town!

STAN
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of
new friends somewhere else. We're a
team!

KYLE, BUTTERS, TWEEK
Yeah!

CARTMAN
That's right!

BUTTERS
Yeah, ahh, that's right!

ALEX
Yeah, we're a team!

STAN
We just gotta figure out a way to raise
three hundred thousand dollars!

CARTMAN
Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys!
We can get Kyle infected with AIDS!
And then start a charity organization
that we steal money from! Come on, let's
go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?


STAN
We need somethng that'll get us money
tomorrow!

BUTTERS
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade?


KYLE
Dog parade?

BUTTERS
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little
outfits, and parade them down the street.
It'll be so adorable!

KYLE
How do we make three hundred thousand
dollars doing that?

BUTTERS
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets
to our moms and dads.

STAN
Our moms and dads are the ones who need
money, Butters!

BUTTERS
Oh...

CARTMAN
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a
little better now.

[South Park, later on, day. The Broflovski house is shown, and
a massive bulldozer rolls up to knock it down. A large chunk
of it is torn off by the scoop.]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!

RANDY
How can you do this to people?

RUNS WITH PREMISE
We're sorry. But if we do not build
a superhighway, our casino might stop
seeing profits.

RANDY
There's more to life than profits!


RUNS WITH PREMISE
Well like what?

RANDY
Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff.


CHRIS
Well, come on, honey, I guess we should
start packing up our things as well.


MR. GARRISON
Yeah.  So long, South Park.

STAN
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could
raise three hundred thousand dollars!


CHRIS
A dog parade?

STAN
No!

RANDY
Stan, we've all tried to raise money,
but we only raise ten thousand dollars,
and the deadline is tomorrow.

STAN
I know. So how about we take the ten
thousand dollars back to the Indian
casino? Tell them, Kyle!

KYLE
The odds on a single number in roulette
are thirty-five to one.  That means,
with a ten thousand dollar bet, you
win three hundred and fifty thousand.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Boys, that's ridiculous.

STAN
Look, we, we've got nothing to lose.


CHEF
What do you guys think?

JIMBO
It's a long shot.

RANDY
Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've
got to save our town.

[Three Feathers Casino, that night. The townsfolk are there once
more]

RUNS WITH PREMISE
The residents of South Park had hoped
to raise three hundred thousand dollars.
but in the end managed to raise only
ten. The loss of their town may be imminent
for the poor people of South Park.
Awww, I think I'm going to cuwhy.


TWO ELDERS
HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!

[The doors open and the townsfolk surge in. Randy carries a large
amount of yellow chips]

RANDY
All right, boys. You're gonna have to
wait here.

STAN
Dad.  Good luck.

RANDY
It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside,
everyone!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
What are they doing?

RANDY
We're gonna try and beat you at your
own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten
thousand dollars!  On thirty one black!


RUNS WITH PREMISE
Impossible!

STAN
Come on! Come on!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Thirty one. Black.

TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it!
We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!


RUNS WITH PREMISE
No... NOOO!

ALEX
South Park is saved.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
We have plenty enough to save our town
now!

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah! But wait.  Three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars. That means if we won
again, it will be twelve and a quarter
million!

MR. GARRISON
We can save the town and be super-rich!


RANDY
Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!

KYLE'S FATHER
Let it ride!!

TOWNSFOLK
Woohoo! Yeah!

KYLE
What the hell are they doing??

JIMBO
Let's go thirty one! Let's see it!


ROULETTE DEALER
Two, red. You lose.

TOWNSFOLK
AWWWWWWW!!

RANDY
Damnit!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Hmmm!

STAN
Theh, they had it! They freakin' had
it!

[The road. The Marshes drive home in their car, a much nicer
one than the one they had once. Randy drives, Sharon sits on
the passanger side. Stan sits between Shelley and Grandpa in
the back seat.]

STAN
You totally had it! You had enough to
save the town and then some.

RANDY
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand
the fine points of gambling. You're
never supposed to stop when you're on
a winning streak.

STAN
A winning streak??!! You played one
game!!!!

RANDY
Stan? Okay?

STAN
What???

RANDY
All right? Stan? Okay?

STAN
You people just got greedy, like the
Native Americans!

RANDY
Hey, mister!! We're not like them,
all right?!  Now, we may have pie in
the sky dreams once in a while, but
we aren't the ones kicking people out
of their homes! So don't you compare
us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing,
evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native
Americans.

[South Park, next day. A "SOLD" sign is placed above the town
sign, indicating that the town, indeed, has been sold. At South
Park Elementary, the residents stand in long lines waiting for
the checks being offered for their homes]

ELDER 2
There you are, sir. There's the check
for your home. Just sign here, and here.


MR. GARRISON
Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're
officially homeless.

MR. SLAVE
Jezuth! Jezuth Chrith!

STAN
Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take
their dirty money!

RANDY
Stanley, we don't have a choice. The
Native Americans own South Park now.
We have to take what they'll give us
for our homes.

ELDER 3
There you go. Have a nice day.

STAN
Come on, you guys! This is our town!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
It's over, Stanley. What else can we
do?

STAN
We can stay. And fight.

CARTMAN
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear
up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!


KENNY
(Yeah!)

ALEX
Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!


CHEF
I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand
economics.

RANDY
It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move
to the next town over.

STAN
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans
decide they want that land, too! What
if the Native Americans just keep building
their casinos and their highways uh,
until we have nowhere else to go?? We
have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh!
Forget it! Come on, you guys!

CARTMAN
You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies!


[South Park, day. Moments later, a train of bulldozers roll down
into town. Runs with Premise, riding on the lead bulldozer, looks
happy until he sees the boys standing abreast on the street,
blocking the way]

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Get out of our way!

STAN
No! We won't let you destroy our town!


RUNS WITH PREMISE
Boys. It isn't your town anymore.

STAN
Just because you have a piece of paper
saying you own it doesn't make it yours.
We grew up here. Our parents grew up
here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and
eat at that Chilis. We take fish from
the streams and bread them and freeze
them to make fish sticks. This is not
just a town, it is our way of life.


ELDER 1
Well your way of life is about to change,
little boys. Now move!

KYLE
You can't just roll into places and
take people's lives away!

A DRIVER
And what are four little boys going
to do to stop us, huh?

TOWNSFOLK
We are strong

No one can tell us we're wrong [Stan looks behind him, smiles,
then looks up to his left. People now appear on the roofs of
the buildings as well as on the street.]

Searching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ong [Stan looks at
the roofs on the other side of the street, smiling.]

Both of us knowing... [The boys grin]

Love Is A Battlefield

STAN
This land is not for sale.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Damnit! I thought you said they were
dealt with!

ELDER 1
They were!

MR. GARRISON
Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your
filthy bastard Indian money!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Filthy bastard Native American money!


MR. GARRISON
Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that.


RUNS WITH PREMISE
This isn't over!

JIMBO
We'll never give up! You bastards!


ALEX
Yeah! South Park is ours.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't
just stand here and block their way
forever.

RANDY
We can stand here as long as it takes.


[Three Feathers Casino, night. Chief Runs with Premise looks
over the casino floor from his office]

RUNS WITH PREMISE
What is the state of our people?

ELDER 2
Last nignt I spoke with the spirit of
the bear, and Bear said that if we do
not build our highway soon, our investors
may soon sell off their shares of the
new casino.

ELDER 1
Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared
market loss on the revenue of the new
casino drops fiftenn percent every day.


RUNS WITH PREMISE
Then we must force the South Park people
off their petty land.

ELDER 1
But they are determined and proud. And
the spirit of the wind has stated that
if we use force, it could be a publicity
nightmare, further hurting our net assets.


RUNS WITH PREMISE
I already have a plan how we can force
them off our land... sneakily.  We're
going to give them...  blankets.


ELDER 1
Blankets?

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Yes. We will present the blankets as
a peace offering. But what the round-eyes
will not know is that the blankets are
infected with SARS.  They will all get
SARS! And then SARS will run through
their town like a buffalo. Now I need
your help getting the SARS onto the
blankets.  Okay, bring them in!  Let's
see how South Park deals with this!
Everyone grab a Chinese person and
rub them on a blanket.  Make sure you
rub them all over. Get the SARS nice
and deep in there.

[South Park, next day. The deadline has arrived]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park,
Colorado, where the residents are entering
the third day of their sit-in to try
and stop Native Americans from building
a superhighway through their town. The
temperature is low, but spirits are
pretty low, too.

RANDY
What do they want?

MR. GARRISON
We're not moving, assfaces!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Free blanket?  Though I know we have
differences, we believe a compromise
can be reached. In the meantime, it
hurts us to see you all on television
sitting in the cold. Will you not take
this offering as a gesture of goodwill?


MR. GARRISON
You had me at "free blanket."

ELDERS
Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...


FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans
are handing out blankets as a sign of
goodwill towards the South Park people.
What an incredible display of compassion.
I certainly hope there's nothing sinister
behind it.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Please. As a token of good faith.


RANDY
You... understand if I'm a little wary
of trusting you.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.


RANDY
Well, thanks.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Oh. You're welcome.

[South Park, day, later. People are anywhere from asleep to sick.]


FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and
the outbreak of SARS in South Park has
reached epic proportions.  The entire
town has been quarantined by the federal
government, nobody allowed in our out,
which means, nobody can come to our
aid.  It appears this town, and this
reporter, are done for. Coming up next,
choosing the right hair conditioner.
What you don't know about hair care
products could be costing you a bundle.


[Randy has taken ill and now lies under a lean-to. Sharon sits
on one side of the lean-to, Shelley on the other. Stan walks
up to his dad with a can of beer in his hand. Randy coughs]


STAN
It's all right, dad.

RANDY
How's your... mother?

STAN
She's hanging in there.  Here, drink
some beer.

RANDY
It's cool on my tongue.

STAN
You're gonna be all right.

RANDY
Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS.
There's only a ninety-eight percent
chance that I will live.

STAN
No, Dad, NO.

RANDY
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our
people. The Native Americans put it
in the blankets they gave us.  Soon
there will be only ninety-eight percent
of us left.

STAN
What can I do?

RANDY
You... must find a cure for SARS, son.
And save our people.

STAN
Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!

RANDY
The spirit of middle-class white people
is strong in you, son. Seek out the
wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO!


[Bellocreek Trailer Park. Stan approaches it and enters. He walks
up to a trailer and knocks on the door.]

WISE MAN
What?

STAN
Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-

WISE MAN
Your coming was foretold to me. You've
come to save our people. Come in.  Watch
the cats.

STAN
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?


WISE MAN
Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit
down.  You must find the answer yourself,
by taking an inward journey.

STAN
An inward journey? That sounds kind
of gay.

WISE MAN
Let the voices of our ancestors show
you the way.  Breathe. Breathe from
the bag of visions.

STAN
Ah! Oh, dude!

[Three Feathers Casino, night. Chief Runs with Premise holds
a meetingn in his second-story office.]

RUNS WITH PREMISE
How much longer must we wait for our
superhighway??

ELDER 1
SARS has spread through the entire town
of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise.
Their wills will break soon.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Then I suppose we must be patient.


WOMAN
Runs with Premise, come quickly!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
What is the matter, wife?

WOMAN
It is our son, Premise Running Thin.
He is very sick.

[Premise Running Thin's bedroom. He's in bed, wearing a headband
with a feather attached to it. His parents approach]

RUNS WITH PREMISE
Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?


WOMAN
He, he shared a cup with one of the
people from China. He has SARS!

RUNS WITH PREMISE
No! I told you not to touch them!

PREMISE RUNNING THIN
Papa. Papa...

MEDICINE MAN
I have given him herbs from the desert
plant and water from the cactus of life.
But nothing seems to be working.

PREMISE RUNNING THIN
This would never have happened if those
townspeople would have just moved away!
No more waiting around! Tomorrow we
begin the final stage of our plan! Shock
and Awe!

[South Park, next day. The townspeople are still sick. Stan runs
up to Randy.]

STAN
Dad! Dad!

RANDY
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey
with the old man? Did you have a vision??


STAN
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I,
I saw something, someone spoke to me
and... told me the middle-class white
way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken
Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.


RANDY
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan,
we must give it to everyone!

KYLE
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan.
I thought we were kind of, sort of,
not really done for.

ALEX
Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan.


RUNS WITH PREMISE
Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested
bodies off the Earth!  What the?  Wait
a minute.  Stop! Stop!  Your, your SARS.
Where did it go?

RANDY
We have cured ourselves using the medicines
of our culture.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
My son... Premise Running Thin has the
SARS as well.  You... you can cure him?


[Three Feathers Casino, upstairs. Premise Running Thin sits in
bed sipping his soup. A can of Sprite and some Dayquil are on
his tray. Around his bed are the Three Feathers tribe on one
side, the South Park residents on the other]

ELDER 1
It is amazing. All our plants and herbs
failed to heal him, but your people's
remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo
back into his heart. Perhaps there are
many things we can learn from your way
of life.

RANDY
We're a simple people. All we want is
to be allowed to live our lives.

RUNS WITH PREMISE
You have cured Premise Running Thin.
In return, I shall give you all five
dollars credit at the casino.  All right,
all right, I will not build a superhighway
through your town. And you can all have
your homes back.

TOWNSFOLK
All right! Yeah!  Woohoo!

ALEX
Well, I guess we all learned that South
Park is more than just a town. It's
a community that nobody can split up.


STAN
Dude, who the hell are you?

ALEX
Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and
do the guest voice thingy.

KYLE
What?! Get the hell out of here!

ALEX
Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Joe!

THE END
SOUTH PARK

Episode 107

"PINKEYE"

by

Matt Stone, Trey Parker & Philip Stark



EXT. OUTER SPACE

A large metal object drifts slowly through space.

TITLE: MIR SPACE STATION

INT. MIR SPACE STATION

A Russian cosmonaut floats around inside the cockpit.

COSMONAUT #1
Vlad nyet chakesfski. Bordat comrade
daboolschnet.

SUBTITLES: "Propulsion systems stable. No problems with MIR."

Suddenly, a green-faced monster with 6 eyes pops out from
behind the control panel.

MONSTER
Graah!!

COSMONAUT
Aieeee!

The monster removes its mask, revealing it is actually
Cosmonaut #2.

COSMONAUT #2
Porchat! Vlidit shtadecht!

SUBTITLES: "Gotcha! Happy Halloween!"

COSMONAUT
Shtadt bodit but shtad!

SUBTITLES: "You scared me you communist bastard!"

A red light on the control panel starts to flash. Yet another
cosmonaut floats into frame.

COSMONAUT #1
Uh... Shtool.

SUBTITLES: "OH....CRAP"

COSMONAUT #2
Schtool.

SUBTITLES: "Crap!"

EXT. BUSSTOP - MORNING

The boys stand at the busstop.

They say nothing, just stare forward and blink.

Kyle sighs softly.

Cartman sniffles. Then --

SMACK!! The MIR Space Station drops from the sky and crushes
Kenny, killing him instantly.

STAN
OH MY GOD! They killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastards!!

CARTMAN
What the hell is that thing?

KYLE
It looks like a UFO!

CARTMAN
There's no such thing as UFOs!

Just then an ambulance pulls up. Two paramedics get out.

The boys watch as the paramedics place Kenny's crushed body
into a plastic body bag.

PARAMEDIC
Let's get him to the Morgue.

They throw Kenny's body in the back, jump in the car and
drive away. The boys stand there for several seconds,
blinking. Then the school bus pulls up and they shuffle on.

CARTMAN
Hey, wait 'till you guys see my
Halloween costume tomorrow! It kicks
ass!

KYLE
Dude, it can't be cooler than mine!

STAN
Hey, man, we gotta get home and get
our costumes ready!

EXT. MORTUARY - NIGHT

Clouds pass in front of the moon behind a creepy building
ominously nestled between two large hills and surrounded by
a huge graveyard.

A large black bird swoops down and perches on a large sign
which reads: "SOUTH PARK Mortuary". The bird lets out a shrill
cry. Then it lets out a poop.

INT. MORTUARY - NIGHT

Kenny's dead body lies on an embalming table, surrounded by
tubes and medical instruments. The MORTICIAN and his ASSISTANT
stand nearby. On the wall behind them is a calendar which is
marked off up till the day "OCTOBER 30".

The Assistant sets the bottle down on a nearby shelf. The
Mortician takes an IV needle and sticks it into Kenny.

MORTICIAN
(Sighing)
You know... I think death is least
funny when it happens to a child.

ASSISTANT
Oh Yeah, I know what you mean.

The Assistant pours some Worchestershire sauce onto a corn
dog and takes a bite.

MORTICIAN
Marty, do you have to put that stuff
on everything?

ASSISTANT
I don't know. It just makes everything
taste so... English!

MORTICIAN
Well, let's let him drain.

The Mortician and his Assistant leave the room. The syringe
drains Kenny's blood into a bucket.

CREEPY MUSIC starts up as we see another tube which runs
embalming fluid into Kenny. We FOLLOW the tube up to a shelf,
past a row of bottles, up to a vat labeled "EMBALMING FLUID".

We MOVE UP to see that on the shelf above the vat sits the
bottle of Worchestershire sauce. As the music gets LOUDER,
the bottle starts to rock back and forth.

Suddenly, it FALLS over and begins to pour out into the vat
of embalming fluid!

As the music reaches a CRESCENDO, Kenny's eyes pop open!

EXT. MORTUARY - NIGHT

The Mortician and his Assistant stand by the back door,
smoking cigarettes.

MORTICIAN
So then the necrophiliac says, if
this ain't a cadaver, then I...

Kenny leaps onto the Mortician and clamps onto his head like
a velociraptor. A short melee ensues as Kenny claws and bites
both men and runs away.

ASSISTANT
(holding his head)
God damn, that little turd bit me!

MORTICIAN
(clutching his arm)
Me too!

EXT. SOUTH PARK - EVENING

As CREEPY MUSIC plays, Kenny's zombie silhouette walks down
South Park avenue -- clouds drift in front of a bright, half
moon.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #1

EXT. BUSSTOP - MORNING

Kyle stands alone at the busstop, but we don't recognize
him. He is wearing a strange, furry mask.

Stan walks up dressed as Raggedy Andy.

KYLE
Ha ha! You look like a pansy!

STAN
Shut up, Kyle!

KYLE
What are you supposed to be?

STAN
I'm Raggedy Andy.

KYLE
(Laughing)
Why the hell did you dress up like
Raggedy Andy, dude?!

STAN
Wendy's going as Raggedy Anne. And
she said this way we'd win the costume
contest for sure.

KYLE
No way, dude. I'm gonna win the
costume contest with this sweet
Chewbacca costume!

STAN
Wendy said that first prize is two
tons of candy!

KYLE
Wow, Cool!

Just then Cartman walks up dressed as Hitler.

CARTMAN
Hey dudes.

KYLE
Cartman... What kind of costume is
that?

CARTMAN
It's Adolph Hitler costume. SIEG
HIEL!! SIEG HIEL!!!

STAN
Where'd you get that?

CARTMAN
My mom made it. Isn't it Cool?

KYLE
NO IT'S NOT COOL!

CARTMAN
What are you supposed to be, Stan?
Howdy Doody?

STAN
No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat ass!

CARTMAN
Oh. Wow, you look pretty cool.

Long pause... Then Cartman and Kyle laugh loudly.

KYLE
Sissy

STAN
I'll kick your ass, Kyle!

CARTMAN
Oh look out! Holly Hobby is all pissed
off!!

Kenny walks up. One of his ribs juts out. Dark circles ring
his eyes. He looks like a Zombie.

KYLE
Hey look, Kenny's not dead.

Kenny slouches a little more.

STAN
You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.

KYLE
Yea, what's the matter? Couldn't
your family afford a costume for
you?

STAN
Yeah, why is your family so poor,
Kenny.

Kenny remains silent.

CARTMAN
Kenny's family is so poor, that
yesterday they had to put their
cardboard box up for a second
mortgage.

The boys laugh and wait for a smart ass comeback from Kenny,
but Kenny just stands there.

CARTMAN
(Agitated)
I said your family had to put a
cardboard box up for a second
mortgage!! Kenny!!!

No response.

CARTMAN
I'm talking to you, Kenny! Achtung!!
Poor piece of crap.

The school bus pulls up.

MS. CRABTREE
Come on, we're running late!

STAN
Ah, we're ALWAYS running late you
ugly skank.

MS. CRABTREE
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

STAN
I said I can't wait to own a fishing
tank.

MS. CRABTREE
Oh... neither can I.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The Mortician and his Assistant sit on a little hospital
bed. The DOCTOR uses his stethoscope on their chests. The
Assistant moans softly.

DOCTOR
Very interesting...

MORTICIAN
What is it Doc?

The Doctor takes the stethoscope out of his ears.

DOCTOR
Well, your temperature is only 55
degrees, you have no pulse, no
heartbeat, and your eyes are all
puffy and sticky.

MORTICIAN
Oh, no. You mean...

DOCTOR
Yea, I'm afraid the two of you have
pink eye.

The Mortician and his Assistant gasp.

DOCTOR
I'd give you topical medicine but I
don't want to touch you.

ASSISTANT
Oh I'm so hungry and all I can think
about eating is is... BRAINS!

DOCTOR
Yeah, well, for God's sake don't
touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some
antibiotics.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The boys walk into the classroom.

KYLE
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet
Chewbacca costume! They're gonna be
so jealous --

The boys walk in and see:

The entire class is dressed up like Chewbacca.

STAN
Whoa dude!

KYLE
(Incredulous)
EVERYONE came as Chewbacca?

MR. GARRISON (O.S.)
It sure does seem to be a popular
costume this year Kyle.

The boys turn to see MR. GARRISON dressed up like MARILYN
MONROE. He lifts up his hands to reveal MR. HAT, who is
dressed as Chewbacca.

MR. HAT
(WOOKIE GROWL)

Kyle removes his mask and throws it down.

KYLE
Dammit!

STAN
Wendy?

The Chewbacca next to Stan takes off it's mask to reveal
that it's WENDY.

WENDY
Hi Stan.

STAN
You said we were going to be Raggedy
Anne and Andy, remember?

WENDY
Yeah.

STAN
We were going to enter the costume
contest as a pair!

WENDY
I know, but then... I guess I just
realized how stupid we would look.

Stan blinks.

STAN
You WHAT?!!

WENDY
I thought you would reach the same
conclusion, so I came as Chewbacca.

Stan slams his head down on his desk.

KID #1
Hey Stan, you look almost pretty
enough to kiss.

KID #2
Yeah, you want to be my girlfrind?

CARTMAN
You see? All of a sudden my costume
is pretty bad ass, huh?

KYLE
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is NOT
bad ass!

CARTMAN
You're just jealous. Why don't you
go back to Endor, you stupid Wookie!

KYLE
Wookies don't live on Endor!

CARTMAN
(Mimicing him)
Mama ma mi mo momo!

KYLE
At least my mom's not on the cover
of Crack Whore Magazine!

CARTMAN
What? What did you say?!

MR. GARRISON
Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas
take your seats.

The boys sit down.

MR. GARRISON
Children, since today is Halloween,
I thought we should learn something
about the great horror writer Jackie
Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins
first wrote her novel..

Kenny's arm falls off and hits the floor.

WENDY
Ew!

MR. GARRISON
Is there a problem Kenny? Let's try
to keep our hands and arms to
ourselves, okay?

KYLE
I'm never going to win that 2 tons
of candy looking like everyone else!

EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Ms. Cartman decorates the exterior of the house with Halloween
paraphernalia. It is already covered with plastic pumpkins,
skeletons, witches, vampires, graphic scenes from car crashes
and photos of mutilated bodies.

She hums happily as she hangs a photo of President Nixon.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh, I'm gonna decorate the house for
Halloween, With scary ghosts and
bats and creepy crawly things.

Just then the Mortician and his Assistant walk by, looking
completely Zombified.

MS. CARTMAN
Hello there! Happy Halloween!

MORTICIAN
Must... eat... brains... brains...

Another Townsperson walks past them and bumps into the
Mortician.

The Mortician and his Assistant immediately rip into the
Townsperson and gnaw on his head. The Townsperson SCREAMS
like a banshee.

Ms. Cartman continues to decorate, singing to herself happily.

MS. CARTMAN
(Singing)
It's the most wonderful time of the
year...

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The boys eat lunch.

KYLE
I'm gonna make a new costume during
recess. I can STILL win that candy!

CARTMAN
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your
pudding?

Kenny sits there slumped over.

CARTMAN
(in a different voice)
No, Eric, go ahead and take my pudding
if you like.
(normal voice)
Why thank you, Kenny, how nice of
you!

Cartman takes Kenny's pudding.

KYLE
Aren't you hungry Kenny?

STAN
He hasn't moved an inch or said
anything.

CHEF approaches wearing a red white and blue jumpsuit.

CHEF
Hello children!

BOYS
Hey Chef.

Chef stops when he sees Cartman's costume.

CHEF
What in the hell are you doing dressed
up like that?

CARTMAN
(mouth full)
Eating Kenny's pudding.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA approaches.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Hello there, children. Oh, love the
Elvis costume, Chef.

CHEF
Elvis? I'm Evil Knieval! Why the
hell would I dress up like Elvis?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Why the hell would you dress up like
Evil Knieval? Anyway, I hope that
you kids are --

She stops when she sees Cartman's costume.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
AAAGH!! Eric! God bless it. What do
you think you're doing?

CARTMAN
Hey, he SAID I could have his pudding!
Ask him yourself!

Kenny drools.

CARTMAN
(in a different voice)
That's right Principal Victoria,
it's okay with me 'cause Eric is
cool.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Where did you get that costume young
man?

CARTMAN
My mom made it.
(loudly)
SEIG HIEL!! SEIG HIEL!!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
SHUSH!!
(Panicking)
Oh, God bless America. You get into
my office before anyone else sees
you! I have to show you an educational
video!

She drags Cartman away from the table. He squeals like a
hungry pig.

CARTMAN
Squueeee!! I don't want to see an
educational video.

Kenny leans over and bites into Clyde's arm -- CHOMP!

Clyde SCREAMS in agony.

CLYDE
OWWW! You bit my arm.

STAN
Oh Good! Kenny's back to normal!

INT. PRINCIPAL VICTORIA'S OFFICE - DAY

Cartman sits in a tiny chair opposite the Principal's desk,
watching a video monitor.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Watch the video Eric.

NARRATOR
Adolf Hitler was a very, very naughty
man.

The image on the TV becomes one of those famous shots from
WW2 footage of Hitler addressing a mass of Nazis.

HITLER
Sfinen! Loobin der Bruce Leeben! Ala
mencian verden brooder! Tauchter aus
elisium! Ala mention vereden brooder
vaus de modem stragal tout!

Cartman's smile grows. He seems impressed and intrigued.

He looks closely at the screen, but now the image of Hitler
has been replaced by Cartman on the stage.

CARTMAN
Juden est forbideen! Est una scrava
uts cafiga hoda!!

HITLER
Juden est forbideen! goddamit!

Now a little Smokey Bear type creature steps in front of the
camera.

SMOKEY BEAR
So remember kids, dressing up like
Hitler in school isn't cool.

These words appear across the screen as Smokey Bear says
them. Principal Victoria shuts the TV off.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Now, do you have any questions?

CARTMAN
Can I see that again? That was cool!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You must remove that costume
immediately!

CARTMAN
I can't, I have to win those two
tons of candy.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well how about we make you a new
costume? Let's see now...

She looks around the office and spots a white sheet on a
shelf.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Aha! Though of something. How about
we make you a nice scary ghost
costume?

CARTMAN
(whiny)
I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!

ANGLE ON: Principal Victoria, as she throws the sheet over
Cartman and starts SNIPPING away with a pair of scissors.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
(as she works)
And lemme just make a few quickie
alterations and... there you go young
man!

FULL SHOT OF CARTMAN, WHO NOW LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE KLANSMAN
IN HIS WHITE ROBE AND HOOD.

EXT. SOUTH PARK

The Mortican Zombie and his Assistant Zombie-walk down the
street.

They come across a pair of Joggers.

JOGGER #1
Ooh, looks like they got a touch of
that pink eye that's going around...

The Zombies attack the joggers. The Joggers SCREAM
horrifically.

INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

The gym is decorated for Halloween. A large banner reads
'Costume Contest!'.

The Chewbacca children all stand in line. At the end are KKK
Cartman, Stan (still as Raggedy Andy) and Zombie Kenny.

CARTMAN
Boo! I'm a ghost!

STAN
Oh man, I feel like a total chode.

CARTMAN
Oh c'mon Stan. Maybe that's just
because you LOOK like a total chode.

CHEF
Hello, children.

CARTMAN
Hey Chef.

Chef turns around and JUMPS when he sees Cartman.

CHEF
AHH!!

Chef runs away.

CARTMAN
Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts
huh!

STAN
Hey, where's Kyle?

Just then, the gym doors fly open and Kyle walks in wearing
a HUGE solar system costume.

KYLE
Check THIS out!

STAN
Whoa, dude!

CARTMAN
What is that?

KYLE
I'm the whole solar system!! The
planets even all revolve the right
way! That tub of candy is as good as
mine!

Mr. Garrison tweets on a little whistle.

MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's get you lined
up so the judge can get a good look
at your stupid little costumes.

The kids line up.

MR. GARRISON
Children, this year we have a
celebrity judge. The star of 'Family
Ties'... Miss Tina Yothers!

Tina Yothers prances out on stage. The kids are unimpressed.

CARTMAN
Who?

KYLE
Dude, I thought she was dead.

STAN
Yea, me too.

Tina Yothers approaches Mr. Garrison and hands him an
envelope.

MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Miss Yothers.

Mr. Garrison opens the envelope.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, The Second Place award for
best costume goes to... Kenny, for
his Edward James Olmos costume!

Tina Yothers pins a red ribbon on Kenny. He drools.

MR. GARRISON
And the award for the Very Best
Costume goes to....

Kyle's eyes widen.

MR. GARRISON
WENDY! For her Chewbacca costume!

Wendy walks past all the other identical Chewbaccas and
receives the blue ribbon.

KYLE
WHAT?! But she looks just like
everybody else!

Wendy receives her two tons of candy.

KYLE
Up yours Tina Yothers!!!!

MR. GARRISON
And the award for the WORST costume
this year goes to... STAN for his
stupid little clown thing costume.

Let's all point at Stan and laugh children.

Everybody points and laughs at Stan.

Wendy stands next to Stan.

STAN
(muttering)
Thanks a lot, Wendy. You RUINED my
Halloween!

WENDY
Relax Stan, You'll feel better once
we're out trick or treating.

Stan can't believe it. He looks bitch-slapped.

STAN
I don't want to trick or treat with
you! You lied to me!!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children let's all gather around
and bob for stupid apples now.

The kids gather around a large barrel of water.

MR. GARRISON
You go first bebe...

Bebe steps up and dunks her head in the water.

MR. GARRISON
That's good, just use those mouth
muscles like the girls in Beijing.

Just then, a little zombie Clyde steps up next to zombie
Kenny.

CLYDE
Brains...

Clyde dunks his head in after Bebe's head. Bebe screams in
pain.

MR. GARRISON
Wait your turn, Clyde!!

EXT. CHEF'S HOUSE - DUSK

Chef walk up to his house with a bag of groceries under his
arm. He pulls out his keys, when suddenly --

BAM!! A townsperson, JOHNSON, throws himself against the
door. He is a Zombie.

JOHNSON
ARRGGHH!!!

CHEF
AGH!!

Chef drops his groceries.

CHEF
Damn, Johnson, what the hell's gotten
into you?

JOHNSON
Piiinnnkkk... eyyeee...

Johnson lunges at Chef. Chef dodges and unlocks the front
door.

CHEF
Get the hell out of here, Johnson! I
don't want no God damn pink eye!

Chef goes inside and slams the door shut.

INT. CHEF'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Chef sits in front of the TV, squeezing one of those
handmuscle things.

ANGLE: TELEVISION

ANCHORMAN
...and the President responded to
the incident by saying, quote, "Screw
those commie bastards, and screw
their little wussy space station".

The Anchorman turns to another camera.

ANCHORMAN

EXT. SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

Stan and Cartman stand on the sidewalk, ready to trick or
treat.

CARTMAN
Where the hell is Kyle? We don't
have all night to wait for him!

STAN
I bet I get more candy than you,
dude.

CARTMAN
Are you crazy? I'm the Candy Master!

STAN
No no, you're the ASS Master. There's
a difference.

CARTMAN
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around
all day looking like Pippi
Longstockings!

STAN
Oh yeah?! Well, at least MY mom's

Magazine!!

CARTMAN
God Dammit! My mom is NOT on the

Kyle walks in dressed as a little vampire.

KYLE

STAN
Oh good you're here. Now, let's make

CARTMAN

STAN
Plastic pumpkin pails?

KYLE
Check.

STAN
Tazer?

KYLE
What's that?

STAN
For shocking people who try to give
us granola treats or something.

CARTMAN
Yeah, granola pisses me off!

Kenny approaches, looking completely Zombified.

STAN & KYLE
Hey Kenny.

CARTMAN
Whew! You stink, Kenny!

The boys consider him for a moment.

KYLE
You STILL didn't get a costume, Kenny?

Kenny doesn't respond.

CARTMAN
Too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying
job or else Kenny's dad would be a
millionaire!

Kenny doesn't respond.

CARTMAN
I said YOUR DAD WOULD BE A
MILLIONAIRE!! KENNY!!! Kenny your
family is poor!! Kenny your family's
poor!!!

No response.

CARTMAN
(To Stan)
I don't like Kenny anymore. He just
doesn't communicate.

The boys start to walk away. Just then, Wendy shows up.

WENDY
Hi guys.

CARTMAN
Hi Wendy.

STAN
(Sarcastic)
How's your barrel full of candy,
Wendy?

WENDY
Oh, I didn't want all that sweet
stuff. I gave it away to hungry
children in Narobi.

CARTMAN
YOU WHAT?! ARE YOU INSANE?!

WENDY
Let's go trick or treats!

STAN
I don't think so, Wendy. I think
you've had enough candy for one day!

WENDY
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed
up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't
be mad.

CARTMAN
How can he be mad with such pretty
hair and rosy cheeks?

STAN
Trick or treat with yourself, Wendy!

WENDY
But Stan.

STAN
No buts Wendy, I wish you were dead!

The boys walk away. Wendy looks sad. She stands there alone,
when suddenly a shadow looms over her. Wendy turns around
and screams.

WENDY
AAAGGHHH!!!!

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Chef rushes into the office, where the Doctor is examining a
patient.

CHEF
Doctor!

DOCTOR
Why hello Chef. Let me guess -- pink
eye, right?

CHEF
No, Doctor! I've seen this type of
thing before...

Chef pulls the Doctor aside.

CHEF
This ain't no pink eye... It's THE
LIVING DEAD!

DOCTOR
What the hell are you talking about?

CHEF
Think about it! Dead people getting
up and walking around... and Tina
Yothers comes to town! Coincidence?
Oh I don't think so!

DOCTOR
Chef, I think maybe the pink eye has
made you a little delirious. Let me
give you some topical cream --

CHEF
Damnit! Don't you see? These people
have been Zombified! They got no
heartbeat, no feeling... I'll show
you.

Chef goes over to the patient and rips off his arm. Blood
spews everywhere as the patient SCREAMS in agony.

DOCTOR
Uh Mr. Torres was here for a routine
checkup, Chef.

Mr. Torres collapses to the ground.

CHEF
Oh. Sorry. But my point is that
topical cream ain't gonna fix what's
wrong here!

DOCTOR
Hey... Hey now, there have been a
lot of incredible advances in topical
creams over the last few years!

The patient passes out from loss of blood.

CHEF
Doctor, who was the first person to
come in here with the sickness?

DOCTOR
Well, it was the Mortician and his
assistant at the Morgue yea.

Just then four Zombies burst into the office!!

CHEF
AAGHHH!!!!

Chef jumps out the window and escapes.

DOCTOR
Now now, fellas, let's form a line.
I've got enough topical cream for
everybody!

The Zombies attack the doctor, who SCREAMS out in pain.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The boys stand on the front porch. The door opens revealing
an older lady.

BOYS
Trick or Treat!

Kenny's other arm falls off.

LADY
Oh, how cute!

The lady takes a handful of candy and starts to put it in
Cartman's bag --

Suddenly, Kenny lashes out and bites the woman's arm almost
in half.

LADY
AAIIIEEE!!

STAN
Dude, Kenny!

Blood spews everywhere.

LADY
OH MY GOD!

She slams the door shut. From inside we hear hear muffled
screams.

LADY (O.S.)
CALL 911! CALL 911!! CALL 911! CALL
911!!

CARTMAN
Oh nice going, Kenny! She was about
to give us the candy!

You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The Mayor pops up from behind her desk.

Why... Why Chef, what a surprise!

OFFICER BARBRADY
You're probably wondering why we're
standing here with a pile of money
and no pants on.

CHEF
Actually, I...

MAYOR

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the
Japanese Mafia

OFFICER BARBRADY
Not a thingy dingy.

CHEF
I don't really give a crap. We've

DEAD!

MAYOR
You mean Tina Yothers?

The Mayor and Officer Barbrady LAUGH hysterically.

CHEF
No, dammit! I'm talking about the
Zombies that have taken over South
Park!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, Evil Knieval, why don't you
jump over them with your rocket cycle?

The Mayor and Officer Barbrady laugh even harder.

CHEF
Aw, to hell with you both!

Chef leaves, slamming the door behind him.

The Mayor and Officer Barbrady laugh for a moment more, then
stop abruptly.

MAYOR
Well, let's get back to it.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Righteeo.

EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - NIGHT

The front door opens revealing an obese man.

BOYS
Trick or Treat!

The man holds out some candy.

MAN
Hope you kids like chocolate peanut
butter cream puffies --

Kenny JUMPS onto the man's back and SLASHES at his face.

The man tries unsuccessfully to pull him off.

MAN
AAGH! GET IT OFF!! GET IT OFF ME!!!

Kenny rides the man as he spins around and COLLAPSES.

The boys look on with blank expressions.

Kenny bites into the man's skull and digs into his brains.

CARTMAN
(pissed)
Dammit! We'll never get any candy if
Kenny keeps eating people!

STAN
Yeah! That's it, Kenny! You can't
trick or treat with us anymore!

The boys leave Kenny eating the man's brains.

tear down a house, we HEAR screaming coming from inside.

in a KKK robe. Behind him stand several other Klansmen.

The Klansmen look down at Cartman in his KKK costume.

KIDS
Trick or Treat.

CARTMAN
Hey... They're all dressed up like

The Klansman throws something into Cartman's pumpkin pail
and slams the door.

Cartman pulls it out and looks at it.

CARTMAN
ONE Tootie bar?! You cheap bastards!

CHEF

BOYS
AHHH! CHEF!! NO!!!!

Chef realizes that the boys look normal.

CHEF
Oh, sorry children, I thought you

CARTMAN
Can we have candy now, please?

Chef frowns when he sees Cartman.

CHEF
Dammit boy, what the hell are you

Dammit!!

CHEF

What are you talking about Chef?

CHEF

KYLE
Well, not really, except that Kenny
keeps eating peoples' brains...

CHEF
Don't you children see? Kenny's turned
into a zombie, along with everyone
else in town!

STAN
(realizing)
Oh my God! That means...

KYLE
(also realizing)
...if everyone has been turned into
Zombies...

CARTMAN
(having an epiphany)
...then there won't be anyone to
give US CANDY!!!!!!!!!

All the boys gasp at the same time.

CARTMAN
AAHHHH!

KYLE
Chef! You've got to help us!

CHEF
I'm working on it, children.

Chef throws a bunch of chainsaws and other assorted weapons
into a duffel bag.

STAN
Wait, where are we going?

CHEF
The Doctor said the first people he
treated were the Mortician and his
Assistant. Now, I've got a hunch
we'll get to the bottom of this at...
THE MORGUE!

The children sit on the couch frightened until Cartman farts.

CARTMAN
It was Kyle.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #2

Chef and the boys look around the room.

STAN
What are we doing here, Chef?

CHEF
Just look for anything suspicious.

Everybody looks around.

KYLE
I found it!! I found it!!!

Kyle pulls out a porno magazine. Bold letters on the cover
read: "CRACK WHORE MAGAZINE". On the cover is Cartman's mom,
posing in lingerie with a glass pipe in one hand and a butane
torch in the other.

STAN
What?

KYLE
See Cartman?! Your mom IS on the

Cartman's eyes bug out.

STAN

CHEF

You better let me take that, Kyle.

STAN
Hey Chef, look!

Chef comes over to Stan, who stands by the embalming table.

ANGLE ON: The plastic tubing. We FOLLOW it up onto the shelf,
past the row of bottles, up to the vat of embalming fluid,
then up to the empty bottle of Worchestershire sauce.

Chef grabs the empty bottle and reads the label. It says:

"WARNING: NOT TO BE USED AS EMBALMING FLUID. EMERGENCY

WHIP PAN around the room and STOP on Chef -- who looks just
like Michael Jackson in 'Thriller'.

I... I can't!

Everyone stops and watches as Kyle runs up with his mule
chainsaw. He approaches Kenny and SLAMS the chainsaw down on
top of his head.

He pushes down until the chainsaw gets caught in Kenny's
neck. GRUNTING, Chef pushes harder, until the saw goes clear
down to Kenny's feet, cutting him in half.

Immediately Wendy turns back to normal and collapses into
Stan's arms.

KYLE
Oh my god I killed Kenny! You
bastard!!

WENDY
(groggy)
Oh. What happened... Stan?

STAN
Don't worry, babe. Everything's gonna
be okay.

KYLE
It's working! They're turning back
to normal!

SFX: CHEESY MAGIC-WAND SOUND as the many Zombie corpses all
over the place lose their Zombie features and turn into
regular corpses.

CHEF
You did it, children!

Everyone cheers.

CARTMAN
Okay let's go trick or treating now
come on!

WENDY
I'm sorry I dissed you at school
like that, Stan. I guess I just wasn't
very considerate of your feelings.

STAN
That's okay, Wendy. I'm sorry I wished
you were dead.

They smile, gazing into each other's eyes.

WENDY
Maybe we could... Actually kiss
tonight Stan...

They lean forward and are about to kiss when Stan VOMITS on
Wendy.

WENDY
Eww! Gross Stan, Sick!! Barf is gross.

Wendy steps through the rotting corpses to run away.

COMMERCIAL BREAK #3

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Stan, Kyle and Cartman, in normal clothes, are standing in
front of a tombstone.

STAN
Oh, man... I can't believe he's
gone...

The small grave reads 'Kenny McCormick' and then 'Sleep well,
little child, the Lord holds thee now'.

KYLE
Yeah... He was too young to be taken
from us!!

STAN
Dude, you're the one who cut him in
half with a chainsaw.

Cartman pulls out a small Kleenex and wipes his eyes.

CARTMAN
Let us remember the good times...
Kenny would have wanted it that way.

Cartman chokes himself up saying this. He really starts to
weep. Kyle puts his arm around him.

All the boys appear to be sobbing. But then, suddenly, Cartman
pops out of it.

STAN
You know I've really learned something
today... Halloween isn't about
costumes or candy... It's about being
good to one another and giving and
loving.

KYLE
No, dude, that's Christmas.

STAN
Oh... Then what's Halloween about?

KYLE
Costumes and candy.

STAN
Oh.

CARTMAN
(Suddenly fine)
Well, let's get home and start eating
candy.

The boys smile and start to walk away.

KYLE
We can eat it at Cartman's house and
see more naughty pictures of his
mom!

CARTMAN
Knock it off, you guys!! She said
she was young and she needed the
money!!

STAN
(Off-screen)
Cartman! The pictures were taken
like last month!!

CARTMAN
(Off-screen)
Screw you guys!!

The boys fully exit frame, and we are left alone in the
graveyard.

The camera TILTS DOWN to Kenny's grave...

Suddenly a brown gloved hand BURSTS through the ground!!!

As Horrific MUSIC plays, Kenny slowly pulls himself out of
his grave!!!

Finally, the music reaches a CRESCENDO as Kenny stands above
his grave and gives out a muted cry!!

PULL BACK

Just then, a large statue from the grave next-door falls on
top of Kenny, killing him instantly.

Music ends, all is silent...

After a few seconds, a small plane crashes on top of that...
As if that were necessary.

"JARED HAS AIDES"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Cartman's hosue, living room, day. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle are
on the sofa laughing as Cartman does some prank calls]

CARTMAN
Shu- shut up you gurs, shut up you
guys.

CITY WOK OWNER
Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease.


CARTMAN
Hello, is this City Wok?

CITY WOK OWNER
Yes, this Shitty Wok.

CARTMAN
Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the
City Beef.

CITY WOK OWNER
Shitty Beef...

KYLE
Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.


CITY WOK OWNER
Shitty Chicken...

STAN
Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial
with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating
at Subway Sandwiches!

[Commercial. The first thing on the screen is a submarine sandwich.
It pans across the screen. ]

SINGER
He's still lookin' good!

[a man appears eating a footlong subway sandwich. The name "JARED
VOGLE" appears on the screen near the bottom]

His name is Jared

[he struts down a sidewalk. "LOST 262 LBS." appears on the screen]


His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...

[a side shot of Jared walking smoothly behind a white picket
fence in Downtown, then of slices of a party sub, then of the
first sandwich]

[Cartman living room. Butters walks in]

BUTTERS
Uh hey, fellas.

STAN
Hey Kenny

BUTTERS
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny!
Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have
to learn to deal with it!

KYLE
Okay, Not-Kenny.

[Commercial continues]

ANNOUNCER
Hey South Park!  You can meet Jared
IN PERSON March 6th at the Kenny McCormick
Memorial Town Square!

BUTTERS
Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!


KYLE
Dude! That's today!

STAN
We've gotta get down there! Come on,
Not-Kenny!

BUTTERS
Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!


CARTMAN
Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.

BUTTERS
Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.

CITY WOK OWNER
Hello! City Wok! City Wok I take your
order prease!

[Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square, moments later. A crowd
is in front of the stage waiting for Jared, with people holding
up signs saying "We Love Jared" "We Love You Jared!!" "Jared
for President", etc. The boys walk up to Mr. Garrison. Kyle taps
him.]

KYLE
Excuse me. Could we get through here?


MR. GARRISON
Hell no! I've been savin' this spot
for six hours!

His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin'
Jared's lead-

RANDY
Here he comes!

SINGER
He's still lookin' good, with all those...
sub sandwiches...

JARED
Thank you all so much. You know what?
After a year of eating delicious sub
sandwiches, I've proven weight loss
is easy!  And I promise you, I will
always be your faithful leader in easy
weight loss!

SOME MEN
Alright!!

CARTMAN
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted
and lost weight. He is sooo cool.


[South Park, later. A knock is heard and a door opens. Jared
is seen eating a sub at a desk. A worker peaks in]

WORKER
Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if
you'd sign their sandwich?

JARED
Sure, let 'em in.  Hi kids.

BUTTERS
Wow, Jared!

KYLE
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight
eating nothing but sub sandwiches?


JARED
I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also
had a little help on the side.

STAN
What kind of help?

JARED
Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big
part of it. But the way that I lost
so much weight was that I got aides.


CARTMAN
Eh, AIDS?

JARED
That's right. I got aides about two
years ago and I've been losing weight
ever since. It's amazing how slim you
can get with aides.

STAN
I'll bet you can.

JARED
Would you like to meet them?

KYLE
Them?

JARED
My aides. Scott, Tyler!  Scott is my
personal trainer  and Tyler is my dietician.


SCOTT, TYLER
Hello.

KYLE
Oh, "a i d E s" aides.

JARED
Yep. Hooray for aides!

KYLE
Well, that's not really what you say
in the commercial.

JARED
I know. You kinda have to read the fine
print at the bottom of the screen. It
says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey
sandwich with no mustard or mayo or
anything like that and then had proper
diet and exercise aides.

KYLE
But you're lying to people. If they
knew that you didn't eat just all the
sandwiches you want, you might not be
so popular.

JARED
You, you think so. Well, why... should
it matter?

KYLE
It matters, dude.

JARED
Hmmm.

[Main Street, moments later. The boys walk along...]

KYLE
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating
sub sandwiches. He lost weight because
he ate less of them and exercised.


STAN
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody
can become famous just because they
go from being a big fatass to not being
a big fatass.

CARTMAN
Ohmigod!  You guys! I think I'm having
a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming
to me now.

KYLE
That that's diarrhea.

CARTMAN
Noo. Don't you see what this all means?
Anybody could do what he did. What's
to stop someone else from going to say,
City Wok, and cutting a deal with them?
Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese
food, but then eat only a little tiny
bit of it and exercise.

STAN
Then City Wok could say their food
makes them lose weight.

CARTMAN
That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow
I tell you.

KYLE
That's a great idea!

CARTMAN
Lose weight and make money. I tell you
this is gonna be the greatest thing
that Butters has ever done.

BUTTERS
Meee???

CARTMAN
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about,
Butters? Joyce de Witt?

BUTTERS
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh
you're the fat one.

CARTMAN
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause
I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't
slim down bones, stupid!

KYLE
But Butters isn't fat.

CARTMAN
That's my whole point. First we fatten
him up, then we make the deal with City
Wok, then take the weight back off.


STAN
He's right. If Butters is naturally
skinny, he'll be able to take the weight
off faster.

BUTTERS
Buut fellas, if I get fat my parents
will ground me.

CARTMAN
Oh come on! Just think about how famous
you'll be!

BUTTERS
You mean like Jared?

KYLE
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!


BUTTERS
Well the heck with that! You said Jared
was a penisbutt!

STAN
You wouldn't be a penisbutt, Butters,
you'd be famous. Just think about all
those people following you around, singing
songs to you just because you lost some
weight...

His name is Butters, it's Butters. [the boys begin to sway for
each line]

CARTMAN
He used to be fat but not no more


KYLE
City Wok brought him down to a size
4.

STAN
Now he's got lots of moneys and girls


CARTMAN
and a lifetime of free food at City
Wok.

BUTTERS
Wow

[Le Place Restaurant, night. Jared is dining with a woman inside]


JARED
Christine, you know I love you very
much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding.


CHRISTINE
I love you too, Jared. You've changed
my whole life.

Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez

She lost forty pounds when she met Jared, and-

JARED
Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh...
some young boys were talkin' to me earlier,
and... it made me think that people
might not be so proud of my weight loss
if they knew something.

CHRISTINE
Jared, what's this all about?

JARED
Uh Christine, this isn't probably gonna
matter to you at all, but... I have
aides.

CHRISTINE
Uhwwwhat???

JARED
Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since
before we were together.  What, what
are you thinking? Are you bummed?


CHRISTINE
Am I bummed?!  You've had AIDS all this
time and you knew it?!

JARED
Well of course I knew it.

CHRISTINE
Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!


JARED
I didn't think it was that big of a
deal.

CHRISTINE
Not that big of a deal?! I slept with
you!

JARED
Aren't you overreacting a little bit?


CHRISTINE
Well Jesus Christ! We're supposed to
get married!

JARED
We can still get married Christine,
I mean, sure, they're my aides now,
but after we get married... they'll
be our aides  You'll love having aides,
Christine, you really will. And when
we have children, they'll have aides.
It'll make things so simple!  Christine!
Jeez, those boys were right. People
really don't like aides. I'd better
tell everyone the truth.

[South Park Elementary, next day. The boys enter the kitchen
to get their meals.]

CHEF
Hello there, children.

KYLE
Chef, we need Butters to gain about
fifty pounds fast.

CHEF
Fifty pounds? Why?

CARTMAN
Uuh, school project.

CHEF
Well, if you want him to get really
fat as fast as possible, one of you
will have to marry him.

STAN
Marry him?

CHEF
It definitely worked for every woman
I ever met.

BUTTERS
Oh no no no! I ain't gettin' married;
my parents will ground me!

KYLE
Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.


BUTTERS
Well uh how come? What's wrong with
me?

CHEF
Well, I guess we're gonna have to do
this the old-fashioned way. Come on
back, children.

[The kitchen, food preparation area. The camera pans across the
table showing pots, pans, and dishes with food all over the place.
It rests on Butters trying to finish off a plate, but struggling.]


BUTTERS
Ugh.  Wuh. Wuh I can't eat no more.


KYLE
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise.


STAN
Chef, we need more food.

CHEF
I'm runnin' out, children.

CARTMAN
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll
kick you till you're deader than Kenny!


STAN
Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't
joke about Kenny being dead. Enough
time hasn't passed.

CARTMAN
So how long until we can joke about
it?

KYLE
Twenty-two point three years. That's
how long it takes for something tragic
to become funny.

CARTMAN
Woogh, that's a long time to wait.


BUTTERS
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep
pukin' it up.

CARTMAN
Then eat your puke.

BUTTERS
NO!!

CARTMAN
Oh come on! Japanese girls do it.


[Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square, later.]

MAN 1
He's going to speak with us once again!


SINGER
He's still lookin' good, eatin' them
sandwiches all the time...

JARED
Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's
is a healthy way to eat fast food and
lose weight!

JARED
But,  I feel like I need to come a little
clean about something, uh-... it wasn't
...just Subway sandwiches that made
me thin.

JARED
The reason I was able to lose so much
weight so quickly was that I got aides.


MAN 2
Huh?

MAN 3
What?

MAN 4
Did he say AIDS?

JARED
But I still wanna be the leader in a
fitter America, and so I'm here to tell
you, that you should ALL go out and
get aides!

MAN 2
Oh my God!

A WOMAN
Is he serious?

JARED
Having aides - is - awesome! With aides
you can literally watch the fat melt
away! And with the proper mix of aides
and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible!


[Cartman's living room, some days later. Stan is measuring Butters'
girth and grins at the result. Camera zooms out]

KYLE
Wow! He looks great!

STAN
How do you feel, Butters?

BUTTERS
W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Ow!


CARTMAN
Get a hold of yourself, man!

STAN
Alright, now it's time for phase 2.


[City Wok, moments later. The boys walk towards it and enter.
The owner greets them]

CITY WOK OWNER
Wercome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try
Shitty Chicken today?

CARTMAN
Sir, we have come to offer you the business
deal of a lifetime.

CITY WOK OWNER
You want the Shitty Beef?

KYLE
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy
your food is. Our fat friend here is
going to lose forty pounds eating at
Shitty Wok.

CITY WOK OWNER
Which one? I see two fat friends.

CARTMAN
The fat one!

STAN
We're gonna take before and after photos,
and then, when he gets skinny from eating
your food, we'll show the world.

CITY WOK OWNER
...Why?

KYLE
Because then you can pay us to use our
friend in commercials.

CITY WOK OWNER
Oh! You mean like-a Jared!

CARTMAN
Just like Jared.

CITY WOK OWNER
His name is Jared, he lose some weight.
Shitty Wok food sure sells great. Yeah,
okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose
weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use
to use him in commercial.

THE BOYS
All right!

CARTMAN
Sir, we are in business!

[Subway company boardroom, day. Jared has been called in to see
the board]

JARED
Well, I appreciate your company doing
everything it's done for me.

SUBWAY REP 2
Yes, well, it is now the opinion of
all of us that perhaps it would be best
for you to take your... strange theories
on weight loss elsewhere.

JARED
...'Scuse me ...am I being fired?


SUBWAY REP 3
Jared, it's just that your new take
on weight loss is contrary to our commetment
to good health.

JARED
How so?

JARED
Ah hah.

SINGER 2
His name is Jared. Jared lost weight
eating Subway and ... sandwiches of


[Flex Gym Fitness Club, day]

CARTMAN
Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny
again!  You are such a flabby hunk of
crap!! Look at those jelly rolls!! Jelly
rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven
chins, boah!! You'll never be thin!!
Nobody loves you!!

BUTTERS
Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom
and dad - love me even if I am fat.


CARTMAN
Butters, I'm just trying to offer some
motivational help here.

BUTTERS
Well alright then.

CARTMAN
ROW you fat bitch!! Look at those jelly
rolls!! Nobody loves you!! You're not
even a person!!

[Jared's dressing room, day. Jared paces the room eating a sub
sandwich]

JARED
I never asked to be famous; now everyone
hates me! I almost wish I had never
gotten aides!

TYLER
Hey now, come on. What kind of talk
is that?

JARED
I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna
be aides-free for a while.

SCOTT
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't
hate you.

TYLER
Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous
that they can't afford to hire their
own aides.

JARED
Wait a minute... you're right!  Yeah!
I think I know how to be a celebrity
again!

[City Wok, outside, later. Cartman and Kyle wait on Stan as he
arrives]

STAN
Did you bring the camera?

KYLE
Yeah, we're all set.

CARTMAN
Guys, I think this might be a good
time to discuss some business.

KYLE
Well what do you mean?

CARTMAN
Well, when City Wok sees how skinny
Butters is, they're not gonna want him
to just make one commercial, they're
gonna want several.

STAN
That's true. Jared did like a hundred
for Subway Sandwiches.

CARTMAN
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive
two-year fifty-picture deal here. My
calculations put that at about four
million dollars.

KYLE
Wow.

CARTMAN
Now, I think the four million should
be split evenly among the three of us,
except that I should get a twenty percent
pernegation fee off the gross for having
come up with the idea.

BUTTERS
Hey fellas.

STAN
Butters?? What the hell are you doing??


KYLE
Yeah, you're still fat!

BUTTERS
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose
it.

CARTMAN
Well we're supposed to shoot yoru commercial
today, you fat piece of crap!

BUTTERS
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya.
Losin' weight is harder than puttin'
it on.

CARTMAN
No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!!

STAN
Did you eat only once ounce of City
Wok like we told you??

BUTTERS
Well uhyeah, but ah, I don't know...


KYLE
Why are you doing this to us?

[Butters' house, later. The boys have prepared a makeshift operating
table on the coffee table in the livingn room. Kyle reads from
a medical book, Cartman has a suction tube and pail, and Stan
is overseeing the operation]

STAN
All prepared for liposuction surgery?


CARTMAN
Check.

BUTTERS
Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.


STAN
Hey, you're the one who screwed us
by not losing weight, Butters.

KYLE
Okay, it says here the operation begins
with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men
on the left side just above the hip.


CARTMAN
That should blah  ah here.

BUTTERS
Woahhh!

CARTMAN
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny
woulda took it like a man!

KYLE
Okay, now put one end of the tube a
half an inch into the incision.

CARTMAN
Alrighty.

BUTTERS
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas.
I feel woozy.

CARTMAN
Alright, I think it's in.

KYLE
The liposuction is a process of siphoning
out the excess fat.

CARTMAN
Bohogh, egh.

BUTTERS
Waaaahh.

CARTMAN
There it goes.

KYLE
Alright, it's working!

CARTMAN
Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you
know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that
Chef makes sometimes.

BUTTERS
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.


STAN
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned
fault.

BUTTERS
Everything's getting dark...

STAN
We've gotta hurry this up.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working
good.

STAN
He's losing weight.

CARTMAN
Oh, whoa. Whoa!

KYLE
It's out of control!

BUTTERS
Whoa, everything's getting sparkly.


STAN
Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.


CARTMAN
Oh, crap!

STAN
Dude, bail!

LINDA
Butters? BUTTERS??

BUTTERS
Mom. Dad.

CHRIS
Butters. Are you having liposuction
surgery? Tell me the truth!

BUTTERS
Yes sir.

LINDA
This is unbelievable! How many times
have we told you not to have self-performed
liposuction surgery in our house?!


BUTTERS
Four times, mom.

CHRIS
Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You
get up to your room right now, mister!


BUTTERS
Yes, sir.

CHRIS
Oh huh don't you give us that look young
man! You're gonna get it!

[News 4 News, day. A field reporter stands in front of the Mayor's
office. The mayor and her aides are present]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out in front of the
Mayor's office, where the big liar,
Jared, is once again about to speak.
Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his
celebrity hero status, which was lost
when he announced that it was AIDS,
not sub sandwiches, that caused him
to lose weight. Let's listen in.

[The podium. Jared stands behind it]

JARED
Ladies and gentlemen, a- at first I
didn't understand why you felt betrayed
by the fact that my aides helped me
to lose weight, but now I understand
that it isn't fair that- I had aides
and most of you don't. And so, with
all the money I've made from commercials,
I have decided to start the Aides for
Everyone Foundation!

JIMBO
What??

JARED
I am going to personally see to it that
each and every one of you gets aides!


MAYOR MCDANIELS
This guys' insane.

JARED
But I won't stup there. I'm gonna seek
out all the underprivileged and hungry
children of the world, and I'm giong
to give them aides myself!

CHEF
You're gonna give children AIDS?!

JARED
Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful
child on this earth has aides by next
month! Aides for everyone!!

SKEETER
Get him!

[Butters' house, some days later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman show
up at the front door, and Cartman rings the bell]

STAN
Come on, Butters. Time to go.

BUTTERS
Uh go where?

KYLE
To City Wok so we can make our money.
God!

BUTTERS
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been
grounded for havin' lipo-suction...
surgery.

STAN
What?

BUTTERS
Wuh well I told you my parents would
be sore, and they said for... havin'
liposuction surgery, I can't play outside
for five days.

CARTMAN
Dude, we just need you to come down
to City Wok real quick so they can see
how skinny you are!

BUTTERS
Well you guys have already got me in
dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got
in double-dutch for... havin' liposuction,
and now you're askin' me to be in triple
dutch?!  Huh uh! I'll never be that
dutch!

STAN
...Kenny would have done it.

KYLE
Yup.

CARTMAN
Do you guys remember what a cool friend
Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for
helpin' us out; man, he was the best
friend ever.

BUTTERS
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom
and dad call in every hour from work
to make sure I am here. If I don't answer
the ph-phone, it'll tell 'em I'm up
to no good!

CARTMAN
Alright alright, I'll stay here and
answer the phone for you.

BUTTERS
No- but you don't sound like me.

CARTMAN
Well you don't sound like me. My name
is Butters and I'm a little pussy who
won't halp his friends make money.


KYLE
Wow, that was pretty good.

STAN
Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters.


CARTMAN
Don't forget, a third of that four million
dollars is mine!

[Stotch living room, inside. Cartman moves to the sofa]

CARTMAN
Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?

CHRIS
I'm just checkig in on you, Butters.
Heh- Do I hear the television? We told
you no television while you're grounded!


CARTMAN
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uhwatchin' television,
Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin'
it.

CHRIS
Jacking it? Jacking what?

CARTMAN
Well my hot spicy boner, of course,
Dad.

CHRIS
What?! Are you trying to get yourself
in more trouble with that kind of language?!


CARTMAN
Well ah, loosen up, you vaginal belch.


CHRIS
Oh!! You are gonna get it, mister!!
You just wait till I get home!1

CARTMAN
Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh,
yes!

[Day, somewhere. Jared has a bat and is beating the hell out
of something...]

JARED
...I tell my  girlfriend I have aides
and she leaves, I tell the  world to
get aides and they think I'm crazy,
I offer to give aides to kids and everyone
wants me  dead!  What's wrong with
aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to
give them  aides?!

MR. GARRISON
There he is, beatin' that dead horse!


MAN IN CROWD
Alright!

JIMBO
Let's get him!

JARED
Aahhh!!

[City Wok. Stan, Kyle, and Butters arrive and enter]

CITY WOK OWNER
Welcome t'Shitty Wok. Take your order
prease.

KYLE
We have great news! Our friend has lost
forty pounds eating your City Wok food.
Here's the before and after photos.


CITY WOK OWNER

STAN
That's right! So now you can pay us

CITY WOK OWNER

STAN

CITY WOK OWNER

to do with Jared land his AIDS.

STAN
Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?

CITY WOK OWNER
Yah they, they gonna kill him. They
gonna kill Jared downtown right now.


STAN
Awgh, come on guys, we gotta sort this
out.

[Butters' house, living room. Cartman has eaten quite a bit of
food (soda, milk, candy, Cheesy Poofs) and is watching TV - a
Terrance & Phillip episode. Only their voices are heard]

PHILLIP
Here's a man's fart for ya.

TERRANCE
God no!  Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has
given me colon cancer!

CARTMAN
Hello?

LINDA
Butters, your father called and said
you made him very upset!

CARTMAN
Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy,
Mom.

LINDA
Butters, where did you get that kind
of smart mouth?!

CARTMAN
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for
sure.

LINDA
Oh, you just weit till I get home, mister!!


CARTMAN
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells
on, you old... horse-bangin' skank.
Hah.

TERRANCE
Ey! There's some anthrax over there!


PHILLIP
Oh no, hahahahahahaha.

[Downtown, Mayor's office, outside, day. The corwd has captured
Jared and taken him back downtown. A gallows is set up and Jared
has had the noose placed around his neck. Two men finish and
walk off. The Mayor stands off to one side with her aides.]


JARED
Why did I ever do those stupid commercials?


MAYOR MCDANIELS
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do
you have anything to say before you
die??

KYLE
Wait!  You're all making a mistake!


CHEF
Stand back, children! Jared wants to
give you AIDS!

STAN
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't
have "AIDS" aids, he has assistants.
Two guys that help him lose weight that
he calls his aides.

PEOPLE IN CROWD
Oh.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
You mean, Jared's aides are like my
aides?

JARED
Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...?
Oh my Gosh!

SKEETER
Oh boy, do I feel stupid.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh we're so sorry, Jared

JARED
No no, hey it was my fault. I can't
believe I I, I didn't think of what
I was saying!

CHEF
Eh so he was saying, children should
have help like he had!

RANDY
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest
misunderstanding EVER!!

JARED
Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted
her to share my "AIDS" - oh, no wonder
she left!

MR. GARRISON
Cuh-can you imagine what we thought
when you said, "Aides for Everyone Foundation"?


JARED
Oh, brother!

SKEETER
Aha-  ...Hey. We're all laughing.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed
about this before.

RANDY
Well don't you see what this means?
It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is
finally funny!

PEOPLE IN CROWD
Ooohhh.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
He's right. It happened!

JIMBO
Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!


PEOPLE IN CROWD
Alright! Yay! Woohoo!  Hooray!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
I knew it would be funny someday!  AIDS!


MR. GARRISON
Then it's time! We can undo the banner!


[Cut to Times Square, where the crawl reads "3-06-02 AIDS HAS
BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED FUNNY"]

NEW YORKER
Hooray!

[Cut to Mayor's office, outside. Everyone now has party hats
on and are celebrating. The field reporter resumes reporting]


REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in the town square
where just moments ago it was declared
that AIDS... can finally be joked about.
What a great day for humanity

MR. GARRISON
"AIDS quilt"

CITY WOK OWNER
Oh boy, this is fantastic! I so grad
AIDS is funny now.

STAN
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend
in your commercials?

CITY WOK OWNER
Sure. Can I pay you fifteen dowlar


STAN
Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!


CITY WOK OWNER
Hey, I'm not a-Subway, I Shitty Wok.
Shitty Wok don't have... million dollars.


STAN
Oh God-damnit

KYLE
Aw, just forget the whole thing then!


CITY WOK OWNER
Okay.  Hey, you kids know why chicken
cross the road?

STAN
Why?

CITY WOK OWNER
'Cause it has AIDS.  AIDS so funny!


STAN
Well, so much for our money.

KYLE
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something
today. It would have been wrong to exploit
Butters' weight loss. Becuase then lots
of fat people would have believed it.
And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese
food instead of dieting properly. They'd
still be fat and, we'd be responsible
for their shattered dreams.

BUTTERS
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat people's
dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.
Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded!


[Butters' house, minutes later. Butters rushes to the front door
]

BUTTERS
Huh. Huh, uh, uh.

CARTMAN
There you are, Butters!

BUTTERS
Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home
yet?

CARTMAN
No, but they're due home any minute.
Come on, you're just in time!

BUTTERS
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find
out I... left the house, did they?


CARTMAN
No, I totally covered for you. They
completely believed I was you on the
phone.

BUTTERS
Hu-oh! Goody!

CARTMAN
Here you go.  I drew some pictures with
crayons so it looks like you were here
all day. And I ate a little food so
it looks like you ate, and I fed your
cat.

BUTTERS
Uh perfect.

CARTMAN
Alright I'd better get out of here before
they get back.

BUTTERS
Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh thanks for coverin'
for me. You're a real pal.

CARTMAN
Butters, it was my pleasure.

BUTTERS
Hi, Mom and Dad!

CHRIS
Don't you "Hi, Mom and Dad!" us, you
little punk!!

BUTTERS
Ow. Dad?

LINDA
You don't even know the trouble you're
in, mister!!

BUTTERS
Ah! What did I do? What did I do?

CHRIS
You think you're touigh now? Answer
me!!

BUTTERS
Aaaa!!

CARTMAN
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally
start jacking off right now.

Episode 901


"MR GARRISON'S FANCY NEW VAGINA"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Trinidad Medical Center, day. A very modern, futuristic-looking
building is seen behind the sign. Inside, a doctor approaches
a patient]

DOCTOR
Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber.
I'll be performing your surgery today.


MR. GARRISON
God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll
make me well again.

DR. BIBER
Now, you're absolutely sure you want
a vaginoplasty?

MR. GARRISON
My whole life I've been a woman trapped
in a man's body. A sex-change operation
is my last chance at happiness.

DR. BIBER
All right, then let's begin.  Just relax,
Mr. Garrison. I think if more people
could just see a sex-change operation,
they would know how perfectly natural
it is. The first thing I'm going to
do is slice your balls.

MR. GARRISON
Ough, ergh. Eww.

DR. BIBER
With the scrotum open, I can now discard
of your testicles.

MR. GARRISON
So long, balls.

DR. BIBER
Now, I'll just continue the incision
up the shaft of the penis.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, that stings.

DR. BIBER
Now I'll just... turn your... penis
inside out.

MR. GARRISON
OH! Oh jeez.

DR. BIBER
All we need to do now is ...stuff the
...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis...
And now I'll use the skin from your
penis to make vaginal lips.

MR. GARRISON
Do I look like a woman?

DR. BIBER
Pretty much.

[Denver Convention Center, day. All-State Basketball Tryouts
are being held there. TODAY! Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny show
up courtside through entrance 51A. Kyle, #4, is in South Park
Elementary's basketball uniform.]

STAN
Dude, don't be nervous.

KYLE
How can I not be nervous? Trying out
for the All-State team has been my dream
for years.

STAN
You're the best player at our school,
dude. You'll make the team for sure.


CARTMAN
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play
basketball.

KYLE
I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman!


LEAD REFEREE
All students trying out for the All-State
team to center court!

STAN
Good luck.

COACH
All right boys, now you're all here
because you're the best of the best.
I know that you've all worked really
hard to make it this far, so let's get
out there and  SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!
Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski,
is it?

KYLE
Yeah?

COACH
Can we talk to you for a minute?  You
uh... You're the best player in your
school, are ya?

KYLE
Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play
for the Denver Nuggets one day.

COACH
Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great
skills and a great attitude. But you're
just not physically ...built for the
game.

KYLE
Oo whataya mean?

COACH
Well, it's just that... Jew's can't
play basketball.  Awwright, kids, we've
gotta work on that shooting! Come on!


[Kyle heads out through 56A but puts his head against a wall,
deeply saddeed. Kenny, Stan and Cartman enter 56A from the concession
stands and head towards Kyle]

STAN
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look,
y-you gave it your best shot, right?
That's all you could do.

CARTMAN
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo
loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm
totally ripping on you at a totally
inappropriate time.

KYLE
I know. I deserve it.

CARTMAN
Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't
play basketball!

KYLE
You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...


[Henry's Supermarket, day. A normal shopping day until...]

MAN
Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe
it!

RANDY
Believe what?

MAN
It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr.
Garrison! He- He's a woman now!

MRS. GARRISON
Hello everybody!  Can you believe it
ladies? I'm one of YOU now!  Wow, just
look at all these tampons! Regular,
heave flow- Oh boy, I can't wait till
I get my first period!

[The ladies' restroom, moments later. Mrs. Garrison enters humming
and takes an empty spot along the sinks.]

MRS. GARRISON
Hi gals!  Oh boy, can you believe the
sales they're havin' out there? Well,
I'm about to pee out my vagina for the
first time.  Give us a hug. Girls' Club!
Oh wow! This is great! Look at that,
I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty
dignified little woman!  Sany, any of
you ladies wanna go see a sad movie
together?  You guys try those new wings
tampons? Do those work well?

[South Park, day. A Souith Park Charter Transit bus stops and
lets Stan and his friends off. Kyle walks ahead of them in gloomy
silence]

STAN
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So
you aren't built right for basketball.


KYLE
But I feel like a basketball player.
That's all I wanna do.

MRS. GARRISON
Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher!
Mrs. Garrison!

CARTMAN
You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.


MRS. GARRISON
I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis
is now a vagina and I'm experiencing
womanhood for the first time in my life!
See ya in class!

[Kyle's house, dinnertime. The family is at table eating]

KYLE
Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?


KYLE'S FATHER
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain
it to you when you're a little older.


KYLE
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just
had his penis made into a vagina. How
come?

IKE
Penis!

KYLE'S FATHER
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my
God!

IKE
Vagina!

KYLE'S FATHER
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT
OF THAT SCHOOL!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of
you! You shouldn't judge people who
want to change.

KYLE'S FATHER
He's a teacher! How are we supposed
to explain this to our children?!


KYLE'S MOTHER
It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes
a person' outside doesn't reflect who
they are on the inside.

KYLE
Yeah. That's right.

KYLE'S MOTHER
They feel like they're somebody trapped
in another person's body. And so, they
can have a surgery  that makes them
more into the person they see themselves
as. Do you understand?

KYLE
Totally! I totally understand!

KYLE'S MOTHER
There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands.


[Trinidad Medical Center, day. Dr. Biber sits behind his desk]


DR. BIBER
So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive
surgery.

KYLE
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be
a woman, and you made him into one.


DR. BIBER
Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had
a vaginoplasty. Mhm.

KYLE
Well, do you also do other surgeries
like that?

DR. BIBER
Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants
to be a man. That procedure is called
a peniplasty.

KYLE
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.


DR. BIBER
...You what?

KYLE
I hate being small and Jewish. I feel
like a tall black man.

DR. BIBER
Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!

KYLE
Yeah!

STAN
Wha-a-a negroplasty??

DR. BIBER
It's a fairly common procedure, really,
just the reverse of a caucasioplasty
just like Michael Jackson had. Let's
take a look here.  What we do is slice
your face and peel it back so we can
insert now pig-ment producing cells
inside.  We break the arm bones in several
places and put braces to make them longer.
Now, the knees we need to snap off
and fill with small round objects that
can cause better movement.  And we finish
it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance
the genitalia.  Negroplasty takes about
seven hours and costs roughly three
thousand dollars.

STAN
Uh excuse me, is this really a good
idea?

DR. BIBER
Well, it's a good idea if you wanna
be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't
recommend it.

[Mrs. Garrison's house, night. Mrs. Garrison enters the kitchen
carrying groceries. Mr. Slave is at the breakfast table moping]


MRS. GARRISON
Hello, Mr. Slave.  Boy have I been busy.
A woman's work is never done.  I got
some tampons. I should be getting my
period really soon. I hope I don't get
too emotional and drive you crazy with
my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got somethin'
for us, too.  Would you like to take
this beautiful woman to bed?

MR. SLAVE
No thanks.

MRS. GARRISON
Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave,
I wanna try out my new snootch.

MR. SLAVE
I can't believe you just went ahead
and had that surgery without even asking
me what I thought.

MRS. GARRISON
Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's
still me; I just have a vagina instead
of a penis.

MR. SLAVE
But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!


MRS. GARRISON
Don't you even care that I was suffering?
I wasn't happy the way I was!

MR. SLAVE
It's great that you feel better, but
you never stopped to think about how
other people around you would feel!


MRS. GARRISON
Look, we can still be together. All
you have to do is stop being gay!


MR. SLAVE
How can you say that?! You're gay too!


MRS. GARRISON
I'm not gay! I'm a woman!

MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jezuth Christh!

MRS. GARRISON
Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna
walk out?! You men are all alike! Go
ahead and find somebody who doesn't
have a vagina, you fag!

[Kyle's house, morning. Kyle runs into the living room with a
paper in hand and faces his parents, who are sitting on the sofa.
They're both reading the newspaper.]

KYLE
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor
who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change
said he can make me tall and black.


KYLE'S MOTHER
What??

KYLE
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty
so I can finally look the way I've always
wanted. He even took my picture and
then did computer imaging to show what
I would look like after the surgery.


KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This
is what your transgender progressive
thinking gets you! Now your son wants
to be transracial!

KYLE
Can I have three thousand dollars,
Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??

KYLE'S MOTHER
Absolutely not, Kyle!

KYLE
But why not? You said sometimes people
need surgery to make them feel better
about themselves.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, but Kyle-

KYLE
Well, all my life I felt I was black!
I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN
and I love playing basketball! My body
doesn't reflect who I am inside.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, you have to accept your body the
way it is.

KYLE
Why? Why do I have to accept it when
I can change it?

KYLE'S MOTHER
The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going
to have negroplasty!

KYLE
But Jews can't play basketball!

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic
right now, mister!!

KYLE
I'm never speaking to either of you
ever again!

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, that does it!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Where are you going?!

KYLE'S FATHER
That Dr. Biber is about to get his
ass bitten off!

[Trinidad Medical Center, day. Gerald approaches it with a file
in hand. He enters Dr. Biber's office and clsoes the door. The
doctor is setting behind his desk]

KYLE'S FATHER
Who the hell do you think you are?!


DR. BIBER
Dr. Biber.

KYLE'S FATHER
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically
alter my son into a tall African-American?!


DR. BIBER
Oh, you're Kyle's father.

KYLE'S FATHER
Huh that's right! And I also happen
to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you
sued for malpractice, and your clinic
shut down!!

DR. BIBER
What is that on your shirt?

KYLE'S FATHER
What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins!
Why?

DR. BIBER
Ahhh you like dolphins, hm?

KYLE'S FATHER
A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since
I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b-
But that has hardly any bearing on what
I'm hear to-

DR. BIBER
I can make you one.

KYLE'S FATHER
...What?

DR. BIBER
Invert the back, move the esophagus
to the top of the head. Yes, a full
dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively
simply...

KYLE'S FATHER
Make me a... dolphin?

SINGER
If I could swim with the dolphins, the
soft and gentle dolphins...

Why can't I swim with the dolphins?

KYLE'S FATHER
...No.  No, no, it's crazy.

DR. BIBER
There's nothing crazy about a person
wanting to look on the outside the way
they feel on ths inside.

[Girls Gone Wild commercial. In the background is a crowd of
men, in the foreground, willing women]

ANNOUNCER
It's Girls Gone Wild!  These gilrs will
do anything!

MRS. GARRISON
Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do
it?! Oh what the hell!  Wooo! Huhuh,
wooo!

MEN
Awww!

MRS. GARRISON
Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce
up and down!  Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee.


[later, at a bar after the video shoot...]

MRS. GARRISON
Oh boy, men will do just about anything
to get a look at our tits, won't they?
Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked
out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But
I've been livin' it up ever since, havin'
sex with all kinds of different guys!
Girl power!  You know, the strange thing
is, I haven't gotten my period yet.
Is there a reason a woman might miss
her period?

REDHEAD
Well, normally, if a woman misses her
period, it means she's pregnant.

MRS. GARRISON
...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course.
I haven't gotten to experience a period
because... one of those truckers I slept
with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant,
everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an
abortion!

[Kyle's house, night. Gerald returns home with a walker and a
highly altered appearance. He now makes dolphin sounds and has
a blowhole and dorsal fin on his back, and his legs have been
joined together to make a flipper. His hands havve been altered
to look like ventral fins. He walks in the front door. His eyes
are black from the alterations and his nose has been elongated.]


KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald! What happened to you?!

KYLE'S FATHER
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila.
Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.
Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin!


KYLE'S MOTHER
A dolphin?!?!

KYLE'S FATHER
Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be
so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy
with who he is, then who are we to deny
hm surgery that will make him feel better
about himself?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald, this is crazy!

KYLE'S FATHER
I used to think I was crazy. But Dr,
Biber told me that there are a lot of
other people out there who are transpecies.
All I did is change my appearance to
look the way I felt...  here. And I'm
telling you now that if we don't let
Kyle do the same, he may never be happy.
Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila.
We owe him understanding!

[The school bus stop, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman work on building
a snowman. Butters runs up...]

BUTTERS
Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!


STAN
What?

BUTTERS
Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro!


[Kyle's house, later. Kyle, now tall and black, stands in the
front lawn. Around him are Kevin, Clyde, Jason, Tweek, and Craig]


JASON
Wow.

CRAIG
Can't believe it.

CLYDE
Did it hurt?

KYLE
Yeah, but it was totally worth it.


STAN
Jesus Christ, dude!

KYLE
Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad
is even gonna take me back down to the
all-star game to see if I can try out
for the team again!

KYLE'S FATHER
Come on, Kyle, we should get going!


KYLE
All right, Dad!

STAN
Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?

CARTMAN
He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.

[Planned Parenthood, day. In the reception area Mrs. Garrison
reads magazines, but sees a woman seated near her.]

MRS. GARRISON
You here for an abortion too?  Yeah,
I discovered a few days ago I wasn't
bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm
knocked up. Is this doctor any good?


NURSE
Mrs... Garrison?

MRS. GARRISON
Oh, that's me.

[Planned Parenthood OR.]

MRS. GARRISON
Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion.


DOCTOR
...an abortion?

MRS. GARRISON
Yeah, I've got one growing inside me.
Now, are you gonna scramble its brains
or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want
you can just scramble it and I'll queef
it out myself.

DOCTOR
Mmister Garrison-

MRS. GARRISON
Mrs. Garrison.

DOCTOR
Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.


MRS. GARRISON
Don't you tell me what I can and can't
do with my body!  A woman has a right
to choose!

DOCTOR
No, I mean you're physically unable
to have an abortion, because you can't
get pergnant.

MRS. GARRISON
But I missed my period.

DOCTOR
You can't have periods either.  You
had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but
you don't have ovaries or a womb. You
don't produce eggs.

MRS. GARRISON
You mean, I'll never know what it feels
like to have a baby growing inside me
and then scramble its brains and vacuum
it out?

DOCTOR
N-that's right.

MRS. GARRISON
But I paid five thousand dollars to
be a woman. This would mean I I'm not
really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a
I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!


DOCTOR
Basically, yes.

MRS. GARRISON
...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.


[Trinidad Medical Center, day. Mrs. Garrison enters the OR as
Dr. Biber operates on a woman]

MRS. GARRISON
Hey asshole!

DR. BIBER
Excuse me, I'm performing an operation
here!

MRS. GARRISON
You told me you were going to make me
into a woman!

DR. BIBER
I gave you a sex change.

MRS. GARRISON
Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't
have abortions and bleed out her snatch
once a month?! You made me into a FREAK
is what you did! And I want you to change
me back!

PATIENT
Am I a man yet?

DR. BIBER
Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your
organs.

MRS. GARRISON
Why the hell not?!

DR. BIBER
Because I've already used your testicles
to fashion new knees for a little boy
who wanted to be tall and black.

MRS. GARRISON
You WHAT?!

DR. BIBER
And your scrotum has been made into
a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to
look more like a dolphin.

MRS. GARRISON
Oh you! You're comin' with me right
now to find my ball and scrotum right
now, Mr. Man!

[Denver Convention Center, night. "All-State Playoffs. Colorado
vs. Wyoming" People crowd into the center. Inside, the two teams
are practicing their shots on the court]

ANNOUNCER
Welcome to the All-State Basketball
Playoffs between the best fourth-grade
players from Colorado and the best fourth-grade
players from Wyoming.

KYLE
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready
to play.

COACH
Who are you?

KYLE
Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a
negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State
team now?

COACH
Well, you're tall and black enough.
All right, Broflovski, suit up!

KYLE
All right!  Dad, I can play!

KYLE'S FATHER
All right Kyle!  Excuse me, where do
you have special seating for dolphins?


[The school bus stop, day. Stan, Cartman and Kenny are almost
finished with their snow man. A car pulls up. Mrs. Garrison and
Dr. Biber jump out of the car.]

MRS. GARRISON
Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not
at home.

STAN
Kyle went down to play in the basketball
game, Mrs. Garrison.

DR. BIBER
He's going to play basketball? Oh my
God.

MRS. GARRISON
What?

DR. BIBER
Well, ah I only made him look like he
could play basketball. If he actually
does it, the testicle in his knees will
explode!

STAN
What?! But you made him into a basketball
player.

DR. BIBER
No, I just made him look more like one.
We have to stop him from playing! Those
testicles in his knees are ticking time
balls!

MRS. GARRISON
Oh Jesus! We've gotta get to my balls
before Kyle hurts himself!

[Denver Convention Center, night. The Star-Spangled Banner is
being sung]

SINGER
...and the home of the... brave!

COACH
Broflovski, be ready to take over for
Owens.

KYLE
I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!


[Denver Convention Center, by the restrooms in the hall. An usher
stands nearby]

KYLE'S FATHER
Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom
for dolphins?

USHER
We don't... have one.

KYLE'S FATHER
Well where the hell am I supposed to
go to the bathroom? I I need a large
tank with salt water.

USHER
Ahhh- Too bad?

KYLE'S FATHER
Damnit you people have to make special
arrangements for transpecies people
like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm
also a lawyer!

USHER
You're a lawphin?

[Denver Convention Center, outside, by the entrance. Mrs. Garrison,
Dr. Biber and the boys approach the doors]

USHER
Tickets please.

MRS. GARRISON
We don't have tickets!

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry.


MRS. GARRISON
Look, there's a boy with my balls in
his knees and he's in serious danger!


USHER
What?

MRS. GARRISON
My scrotum!  That dolphin has my scrotum!
Now let us in!

SECURITY GUARD
You can't go in, ma'am!  We have unauthorized
entry on level one!

[Denver Convention Center, courtside. The Colorado team drives
to the opposite basket. The coach addresses Kyle]

COACH
All right. Broflovski, you're going
in next possession.

KYLE
All right!  Ow. Hm.

[Denver Convention Center, by the restrooms. Mrs. Garrison and
the others approach Gerald]

MRS. GARRISON
Gerald, where's Kyle?!

KYLE'S FATHER
What? Why??

MRS. GARRISON
My balls are in his knees. If he jumps
with them they'll explode!

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh my God!

SECURITY GUARD
There they are, next to that dolphin!


DR. BIBER
Come on, we've gotta get to those balls!


SECURITY GUARD
Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar
entry fee!

[Denver Convention Center, courtside. Kyle has suited up and
now enters the game.]

ANNOUNCER
Now substituting for Colorado, number
8, Kyle Broflovski.

STAN
Oh Jesus, he's about to play!

KYLE'S FATHER
Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!

MRS. GARRISON
Which one is he??

WYOMING COACH
Hey, what the hell?!

KYLE'S FATHER
Stop the game!

KYLE
I got it! I got the ball.

STAN
Kyle, NO!

ANNOUNCER
Broflovski goes for the dunk!

MRS. GARRISON
NO!  My baaaallllssss.

[Denver Convention Center, outside. The police and paramedics
have arrived and Kyle is sitting up on the gurney]

OFFICER
So let me get this straight. That woman
over there was trying to get to her
balls which were in the knees of a black
child whose father is a dolphin.

STAN
Yeah, that's basically it.

OFFICER
Sounds like an open and shut case. All
right, let's head 'em out!

DR. BIBER
I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told
you the surgery was cosmetic only.


KYLE'S FATHER
So, does this mean I'm not really a
dolphin?

DR. BIBER
Let's get you two up to the clinic and
I'll change you back, for a nominal
fee.

KYLE
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't
go back.

MRS. GARRISON
You know what? I'm okay. Even though
I'm not truly a woman, I think I still
like the new me. I'd rather be a woman
who can't have periods than a fag.
Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman!
Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!

"YOU GOT F'D IN THE A"


Written by


Trey Parker





[A parking lot somewhere in South Park, day. The boys are playing
with motorized toy cars]

CARTMAN
Dude, these little remote-controlled
cars are kickass.

KYLE
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump.


STAN
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new
one.

KYLE
Hey, who are those kids?

BOOMBOX
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've
got nothin' on me!

Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!

Let's see you...! Let's see you...!

Let's see you...! Let's see you...!

Daaance, sucka!


[brief instrumental]


Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!

Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!

Let's see you daaance-

OC LEADER
Yeah, how you like that y'all!

OC MEMBER 1
Let's bring it to these losers.

OC GIRL
Aww yeah!

OC LEADER

Damn! You just got served!  Aww man!


OC GIRL
He got you, dude.

OC LEADER
Now that kid is gettin' served!

OC GIRL
Uh huh.

OC
Whoa!

OC LEADER
Aww man, look at them! They know they

OC MEMBER 2
That was smokin'!

OC MEMBER 1
They didn't do nothin'!

OC MEMBER 3
Sorry y'all, but tru not to let it
sting too bad!

OC LEADER
You got served!  Come on! They had
nothin'! Let's go y'all!

OC MEMBER
Come on y'all!

KYLE
...What the hell just happened?

[Chef's house, later. Stan rings the doorbell]

CHEF
Oh. Hello there, children!

STAN
Chef, we just got served.

CHEF
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children.
I'll make you some cocoa.

[Chef's house, living room. Chef shows the children to the couch]


CHEF
Have a seat, children. Just try to relax
and breathe.  Are you all okay?

KYLE
Yeah.

CHEF
All right. Now, where did you get served?


STAN
Over at the True Value parking lot.
There were just these kids we never
saw before showed up and they were like,
really good dancers and, we don't really
understand what it means, but I guess-


CHEF
Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's
all over now. Just try to calm down
and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your
parents and let them know you're okay.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm
good. Listen: Stan and his friends just
got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the
True Value. No no, he's fine. They're
all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from
out of town. Apparently they were pretty
good dancers. They really let 'em have
it.

[Stan's house, that night. The family is at the dining table.
Sharon brings a large dish over to Stan]

SHARON
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite
potato dish. I want you to feel better,
okay.

RANDY
What's the matter with him?

SHARON
Oh. Stan got served at school today.


RANDY
You got served? By who?

STAN
Some, kids from Orange County.

SHARON
Let's not make a big deal out of it.


RANDY
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance
back?

STAN
No.

RANDY
What? Yo-you got served and just stood
there and took it??

SHARON
That was the right thing to do.

RANDY
Naw, that's crap, Sharon! Stanley, when
somebody challenges you to dance, you
have to dance back at them, or else
they'll think you're weak.

STAN
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or
nothin'.

RANDY
Well then, it's about time you learned!
Put on some loose-fitting clothes and
meet me in the garage!

STAN
But Dad-

RANDY
Now!

[Stan's house, garage. Stan and Randy are present. Randy is dressed
in sweats, Stan is dressed in sweat pants and sleeveless T-shirt.
Randy puts a CD into a stereo system.]

RANDY
All right son, dancing is all about
a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling
you to go around challenging other kids
to dance, but when they challenge you,
you just look 'em straight in the eye,
and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.
...six, seven, eight.

[South Park, day, Luau's Toys. Stan and his friends exit and
walk down the street]

KYLE
Dude, that is a sweet RC car.

STAN
Yeah, let's go race it right now.


OC MEMBER 2
Well, what we got here?

OC MEMBER 1
It's the white boys that were served
yesterday.

OC LEADER
You want a little more, homeboys?

KYLE
We're not interested, thanks.

OC MEMBER 1
You're not interesetd? Not interested
in this??

BOOMBOX
You can't step to my roots, so don't
try it.

You cant burn with my group so dont light it.

I'm on the OC crew and I'm better than you.

You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.

You can't bop her like me so don't go there.

You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.

I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.

I'm a good listener and that's rare.

BLACK MAN
Oh Lord, look at those moves.

BLACK WOMAN
Oooo, they are takin' it out!

BLACK MAN 2
Oh man, they are getting served!

BLACK WOMAN 2
Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!

BLACK MAN 3
Have mercih!

OTHERS
Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin'
served!

KYLE
Yeah! Go Stan!

CHEF
Oh no!  No, stop Stan! You don't know
what you're doin'!

KYLE
All right Stan!

CARTMAN
HA! You just got f'd in the a!

OC LEADER
Wha?

KYLE
Yeah! YOU got served!

KENNY
Woohoo.

CARTMAN
Yeah!

KYLE
That's right!

CARTMAN
All right!

KENNY
Woo woo.

CHEF
No no no!

OC LEADER
Okay. All right. We got served. So now,
I guess... It's on.

STAN
What?

OC MEMBER 1
This Saturday! Our top five dancers
against yoru top five dancers! OC Convention
Center. It's on!

OC MEMBERS
It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!


TOWNSMAN
Oh Lord it's on!

CHEF
Oh damnit! I knew that was gonna happen.


OC MEMBER 3
We'll see you Saturday, fools!

OC MEMBERS
Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better
dancers with you than those loozas!
'Cause it's on!

OC MEMBERS
It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!


CHEF
Stan, what the hell did you dance back
for??

STAN
I thought I was supposed to!

CHEF
Now you've gotta compete against them
in the dance competition on Saturday!


STAN
But why??

CHEF
Because if you get served and served
them back, then it's on! Don't you know
anything??

[Stan's house, breakfast nook. Randy is filling out checks for
his bills]

SHARON
Well, nice going, Randy! Really great
advice you gave our son here!

RANDY
What?

SHARON
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again
and he danced back!

RANDY
So what happened?

SHARON
It's on!

[OC Convention Center, day. A large screen over the Center says
"Bounce" while a sign closer to the viewer says "This Saturday,
7 PM, Orange County VS. South Park, Dance Competition. It's On!!!!"
Inside, preparations are made for the competition. On the floor,
the OC crew practices its move under their coach's supervision]


COACH
Come on now, keep it tight!  Good.
Now watch that timing, drill team!


OC MEMBER 1
All right!

OC GIRL
All right!

OC LEADER
Yeah, bad ass!

OC MEMBER 2
Yeah, that was tight!

COACH
Not bad, kids. Not bad.

OC MEMBER 1
Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a
chance!

OC GIRL
I heard that!

COACH
All right, it was good. But we don't
want "good," we want pain!

RANDY
Uh ex, excuse me.

COACH
Yeah?

RANDY
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm
I'm Stan Marsh's father.

COACH
Oh, so you're the father of the boy
who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?


OC MEMBER 3
Dang!

OC LEADER
Oooooo!

RANDY
Uh, listen. Ih, it was my fault that
Stanley served your boys the other day.
Uh, I told him to do it and I... Weh
well look I, I just came down here to
tell you... Ih it's not on.

COACH
Oh, it's on!

RANDY
Nonono, it's not on.

COACH
Whoo, it's on all right!

RANDY
It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.


COACH
It's on!

RANDY
I'm keeping my son home on Saturday.
I just came by to let you know so you
can... put a stup to all this. Good
bye.

COACH
Hold on a second, clamhead!  You think
you can just roll in here and tell us
it's not on when it very clearly is
on?! You're just trying to make us not
practice, aren't you?! Because you KNOW
that your kids are goin' down when my
kids give them this! Give me some moves
out, Girl T!  Check this out!  Yeah!
You like that?!

OC LEADER
Oooo man!

OC MEMBER 1
Ohhh Lord!

OC LEADER
Oooo, he is gettin' served!

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Randy is recovering in a room. He's
got breathing tubes in his nose and his eyes are squeezed shut.
His friends surround him]

RANDY
Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.

SHARON
Randy?  Randy, oh my God!

SKEETER
What happened to him, Doctor?

DR. DOCTOR
He got served. Worst I've ever seen.


JIMBO
Old fool went down to the OC to try
to reason with the other team, and he
got served up somethin' fierce.

CHEF
Oh Lord...

RANDY
His dancing was so fast I ...couldn't
do anything. His moves were... so original,
so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.

NURSE
Shh relax, Mr. Marsh.

DR. DOCTOR
We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly
got served here  and here . But the
worst serving was here in the pelvic
region. The road to recovery will be
a long one.

JIMBO
Boy. You must really wanna take to to
those Orange County kids now, huh Stan?


SKEETER
Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready
to pounce on them after what they did
to his father!

STAN
I, I don't know. He seems all right.


MR. GARRISON
I could only imagine the rage building
inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait
to outdance those OC bastards!

RANDY
Stan?? Stan??

STAN
Yeahh I'm I'm right here, Dad.

RANDY
Stan, listen to me. I don't want you
feeling like you have to do that competition
now to avenge me.

STAN
Okay, good.

RANDY
But I know I can't stop you from doing
it. So all I can say is... give 'em
hell, son. Give 'em hell.

STAN
God damnit!

[Loading dock at South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks over
and finds the Goths there, as usual. Henrietta reads a book]


STAN
Hey guys. Uh. You guys know how to dance,
right?

TALL GOTH
Of course we know how to dance.

STAN
Cool, because, there's this competition
on Saturday, and I have to find the
very best dancers in South Park to be
on my crew. My friends can't do it because
they suck ass, so, will you be in my
dance troupe?

RED GOTH
Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance
like those Britney and Justin wannabes
at school.  Goth kids dance to express
pain and suffering.

TALL GOTH
Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is
to keep your hands at your sides and
your eyes looking at the ground. Then
every three seconds you take a drag
from your cigarette.

STAN
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's
a dance competition this Saturday and
I need good dancers so I don't get served.


RED GOTH
No way. Dancing is something you do
alone in your room at three in the morning.


STAN
Please, you guys, our whole town's
reputation is at stake! Will any of
you do it?

RED GOTH
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group
is totally conformist.

HENRIETTA
Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off
regulations.

LITTLE GOTH
I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest
nonconformist of all.

TALL GOTH
I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not
going to conform with the rest of you.
Okay, I'll do it.

STAN
Great!

HENRIETTA
Whoa. I think we just got put in our
place.

RED GOTH
Yeah. We just got Goth-served.

[The neighborhood. Stan and the tall Goth walk down the street]


STAN
All right, we gotta find three other
kids that can dance.

TALL GOTH
We should go to the arcade.

STAN
The arcade?

TALL GOTH
Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao.
He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution
game.

[The Sinistarcade. A Dancin' Dancin' Dancin' Machine game is
prominently shown, and an Asian boy dances furiously on the foot
pad on the right. The arrows indicate which foot buttons the
boy should be stepping on. He's hit every one, so his score is
perfect. Stan and the tall Goth look on]

STAN
Dude, he's incredible.

TALL GOTH
He should be. He's here playing that
game every single day after school.
I think he's spent about six thousand
dollars on it so far.

STAN
Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would
you like to join our dance troupe?


YAO
You mean, dancing without a machine
telling you what to do?

STAN
Yeah.

YAO
That's stupid.

STAN
Dude, we need you.

YAO
I can't dance without the machine.


STAN
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna
coach us.

YAO
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

STAN
All right, that's three!

TALL GOTH
Dude, we need a girl.

STAN
Huh?

TALL GOTH
We can't be a dance troupe with just
guys. People will think we're fags.


STAN
Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just
where to go!

[Raisins. Happy Hour all day!!! Inside the little waitresses
go about their work. Two of them dance asscheek to asscheek,
shaking their asses in rhythmic unison. Mercedes dances her ass
off to a boy, who looks on in bliss]

PORSCHE
Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of
you?

STAN
Ah actually we were just hoping we could
talk to you guys real quick.

MAURY
You have to buy wings if you wanna talk
to the Raisins girls.

STAN
And so we're putting all the best dancers
in South Park together to beat Orange
County.

MERCEDES
Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted
to try my dancing somewhere else.


STAN
So you'll do it?

MERCEDES
Why not?

STAN
All right, we just need one more person!


MERCEDES
Hey, we should get that kid that was
state champion in tap dancing.

STAN
What? The state tap champion is from
here? Who?

MERCEDES
I think his name was...  Leopold...
Stotch or something?

STAN
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You
mean...

[Butters' house, day. He's at the kitchen assembling a toy car]


BUTTERS
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo
loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo
loo, I've-

LINDA
Butters, you have some visitors.


BUTTERS
Oh well hi there everybody.

STAN
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a
competition this Saturday, and we want
you to join our troupe.

BUTTERS
Wow, neato, a competiton? Why, I'd love
to. What kind of competition is it?


STAN
It's a dance-off. We heard you were
tap dancing state champion two years
ago.

BUTTERS
...No.

STAN
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went
to the nationals in Nebraska.

BUTTERS
No.  No no nono no no, no!  No! No no
no no!

LINDA
Butters?  Butters??

STAN
We just asked him to join our dance
troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.


LINDA
Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just
that... Butters hasn't danced since
the tragedy.

MERCEDES
A tragedy?

BUTTERS
Waaaaah!

LINDA
I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.


[Outside. The kids leave Butters' house and make their way to
the sidewalk]

STAN
Damnit, where are we gonna get our fifth
member?

YAO
Hey I heard about this guy in Cuomo
who has a duck that can dance.

STAN
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those
OC kids are professional dancers! Now
come on, there's gotta be one other
talneted person in South Park.

BUTTERS
Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!

[A ranch. Stan and his troupe arrive]

STAN
All right, so you're sure he can dance?


RANCHER
Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.


YAO
That don't look like a dancing duck
to me.

RANCHER
Well, that's 'cause it needs music.
Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.

You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.

You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe.

[the duck rises and begins to dance]

You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til
the mornin' time.

Honey, babe, be mine.


You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-

STAN
Ih ih Is that the only song he'll dance
to?

RANCHER
No no, he'll dance to anything. See?


You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.

You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.

You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night
and day.

Honey, babe, be mine.

STAN
My friends, I think we have ourselves
a dance troupe.

[Butters' house, day. Linda walks up the stairs to Butters' room
and knocks on the door.]

LINDA
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie,
it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters.
You went through a lot of therapy for
this. That was almost two years ago,
sweetie.

BUTTERS
Two years ago. Two years ago!

[the camera goes into Butters' eye and a memory of the finals
two years prior comes up. A girl dances, finishes, and takes
several curtsies]

ANNOUNCER
That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis,
folks. Let her hear it!  All right,
and now, dancing to the song "I've Got
Something In My Front Pocket For You,"
here is Colorado state champion, Leopold
"Butters" Stotch!

SINGER
I've got something in my front pocket
for you

Why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is

Then grab onto it, it's just for you

Give a little squeeze and say, "How do you do?"

There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my
front pocket,

There's something in my front pocket-

BUTTERS
Whoops.

WOMAN
Paul. Paul!

BUTTERS
Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo!
Noooooooooooooooo!

[South Park, day. Chef approaches Lamont's Dance Studio with
his boombox and duffle bag]

CHEF
All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!
We don't have much time, and you've
got to become the dance group you can
be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This...
is the dance troupe?

STAN
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park
has to offer.

CHEF
Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't
you show me what you got? I wanna see
what you kids can do!

BOOMBOX
You can't step to my roots, so don't
try it.

You cant burn with my group so dont light it.

I'm on the Eastside crew and I'm better than you.

You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.

You can't bop her like me so don't go there.

You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.

I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.

I'm a good listener and that's rare.

CHEF
Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children!
No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't
you see, children? You have the heart,
but you don't have the soul. Nono, wait.
You have the soul, but you don't have
the heart.  Nono, scratch that. You
have the heart and the soul, but you
don't have the talent.

STAN
We're gonna get served on Saturday,
aren't we?

YAO
What? I don't wanna get served.

MERCEDES
Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might
get served.

STAN
Well that was the whole point of the
whole thing was that the guys came back
and they said we were gonna get served
and we were like-

CHEF
All right all right, quiet, children!
Now, nobody's getting served if I can
help it. We just gotta buckle down,
dig deep, and pray that maybe the other
team comes down with cancer.

[Butters' room. He's working on a little village, which might
be a model of South Park. Stan enters and walks up to him. Butters
glances back and then looks at his work again.]

BUTTERS
What do you want?

STAN
I came to ask you one more time to join
the crew. Everyone is practicing really
hard, but... I don't think we have any
kind of shot without you.

BUTTERS
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.
I gave that up.

STAN
Your mom says you were one of the best
dancers in the country.

BUTTERS
Did she also tell you my dancing got
eight people killed?

STAN
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It
wasn't your fault

BUTTERS
Yeah well, you tell that to their families.


STAN
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We
all have to live with that.

BUTTERS
I let those people down! Don't you
get it man?! Eight people died!

STAN
Well, it was nine, actually. One of
the women was pregnant.

BUTTERS
Oh what?

STAN
And eleven if you count the two family
members that killed themselves afterward.


BUTTERS
HAAAA!

STAN
But that isn't the point, Butters!
The point is that this is now! It's
on! And there are people who need you
to step up! Look, nobody likes having
to rise to a challenge. But competing
against other people and getting in
their faces saying "Haha! I'm better
than you!" is part of life. And if you
can't face that, then you might as well
sit here and play Leggos until you're
an old man.

BUTTERS
Get out of my room, Stan!

STAN
Fine.  But someday you're gonna have
to stop running from what happened and
start dealing with it. Otherwise, you
might as well move to France with all
the other pussies.

[The OC Convention Center. "It's ON!!!! NOW!!!!"]

MC
Yeah, make some noise!  Ladies and Gentlemen,
man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever
crew wins tonight, you wanna remember
their faces, 'cause the next time you
see them... will be in Lil Kim's next
video! Give it up for Lil Kim!

LIL KIM
What's up, niggaz?!

MC
This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all.
So let's give it up for the OC Crew!
And the challengers, the South Park

MERCEDES
He was practicing the say takedown and
slipped on the floor.

OC MEMBER 3
Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!


YAO

STAN
Aw, what do we do, Chef??

CHEF
Rules are you have to have five dancers.
We have no choice, children. We have

Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!

[the OC leader comes up to Butters and serves him with a balance
act on the right hand twice and a back flip, then returns to
the crew, spins on his head a few times, then ends on his side,
resting his head on his right hand]

Let's see you...! Let's see you...!

Daaance, sucka!


[brief instrumental. The Diggitys answer the serve with a sequence
that has the members twirling and handing off to the next one
until all point to Butters. He then steps forth tap-dancing.
He dances well, but his dancing gets intense quickly. The OC
crew is awed. It got served.]


Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!

Let's see you daaance.

[Butters' intensity is so great that his left shoe flies off
his foot and sails into the rafters]

BUTTERS
Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!

OC MEMBER 1
Aaaah!

OC MEMBER 3
Kill him!

MC

Episode 702


"KRAZY KRIPPLES"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, day. Now showing at the South Park Community Theatre]


[Fanfare begins with a drumroll, a spotlight hits its mark on
stage and an announcer speaks]

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for
JIMMY!  Thank you! Wow. What a terrific
audience.  I know what most of you are
thinking. "Hey, uh-that guy stole my
show..."  Wow, what a great audience.
And how about this Michael Jackson guy,
huh? I mean, come on...  Wow, what a
great audience.  Uh... l... lights,
please?

BUTTERS
Hey Jimmy.

JIMMY
Butters, w-where is everybody?

BUTTERS
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher
Reeve came to town to do some kind of
show, and everyone went to see him.


JIMMY
Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!


BUTTERS
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy
who played Superman.

JIMMY
I know who he is! But why is everyone
ditching my comedy show to see him?!


BUTTERS
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but
now he can move his finger. He is an
inspiration to us all. That's why everyone
ditched on your show.

JIMMY
So then, how come you came?

BUTTERS
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm
a dork, huh?

[South Park Town Sq... Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square.
Mayor McDaniels is on stage with her aides. Above them a banner
reads "STEM CELL RESEARCH." A crowd of people has formed in front
of the stage]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
And so without further ado, here's the
most courageous, most amazing man on
the planet, Christopher Reeve.

REEVE
Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great
audience.  I just flew into South Park.
Used to be I didn't need an airplane.


TOWNSPEOPLE
Awwwww.

REEVE
As most of you know,  I am a strong
supporter of stem-cell research.

JIMMY
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin'
to my ...c-comedy show!

CARTMAN
We didn't go to your comedy show.

JIMMY
I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious!


STAN
Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude.


JIMMY
Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!


KYLE
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't
make fun of Christopher Reeve.

STAN
Yeah dude, not cool.

REEVE
Though it is controversial,  stem cell
research is critical  in the quest for
helping  the disabled.

JIMMY
I put together a comedy show and I was
crippled from BIRTH!

STAN
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay
out of this one.

KYLE
Yeah, this is starting to look like
something we shouldn't be any part of.
Let's go play with trucks or something.


TIMMY
Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.

JIMMY
Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?


TIMMY
Timmeh!!

JIMMY
Why is a celebrity who became crippled
more important than us that were born
that way, very much.

TIMMY
Rrruh Timmeh!

REEVE
In the coming days  I will prove to
the world  that stem-cell research is
a miracle.

[The bus stop, day. The boys are on the snow playing with their
trucks.]

CARTMAN
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.


JIMMY
Hey there fellas.

STAN
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Say, would you guys like to join our
club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You
aren't crippled.

KYLE
What?

JIMMY
To be in our club, not only do you have
to be c-c-crippled, but you have to
have been born that way. Do you know
what that means? No butthole Superman
asswipe Christopher Reeve!

STAN
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna
stay out of this one.

CARTMAN
Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can't
just start a club and tell me I can't
be in it!

JIMMY
Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.


CARTMAN
Can too!

JIMMY
Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people
does it take to screw in a light bulb?
One.  You know what you call an able-bodied
guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name
is.

CARTMAN
Oh God-damnit!!

KYLE
Cartman, just stay out of it.

CARTMAN
But they say I can't be in their club!!


STAN
Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any
part in this one.

["The T-shirt Factory", later. Timmy and Jimmy walk up to it
and enter]

JIMMY
Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy.


MCGILLICUDDY
Hello, boys. What can I do for you?


JIMMY
Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design
for our new club.  We just came up with
a name this morning.

MCGILLICUDDY
Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna
wear these shirts

JIMMY
Why not?

MCGILLICUDDY
Well, because there already is a group
that calls themselves the Crips, and
I don't think they'd like it too much.


JIMMY
...There's already a Crips?!

MCGILLICUDDY
Well, sure, they're all over at Five
Points area in Denver. You've never
heard of them?

JIMMY
No, we never have. Are they crippled
from birth or are they cripple wannabes
like Christopher Reeve?

MCGILLICUDDY
...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one.


["The T-shirt Factory", outside. The doors open and Jimmy and
Timmy exit]

JIMMY
Can you believe it, Timmy? All this
time there was a group for truly crippled
people like ourselves, and we didn't
know it.

TIMMY
Timmmeh!

JIMMY
Come on. We have to take the bus to
Five Points in Denver.

[The Larry King Show on HNN, on air.]

KING
My guest tonight is the brilliant star
of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher
Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell
research, is now able to move his arms.


REEVE
Thanks for having me on again, Larry.


KING
All right. Chris, the whole world is
waiting. Why don't you show us what
stem-cell research has done for you.
Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks?
Now, Chris, there're some people who
say stem-cell research is wrong, that
takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.


REEVE
Well, it just proves that the public
needs to be educated  about stem-cell
research. See, the stem cells from a
fetus like this one  can form into whatever
cells of the body are damaged. They
are the most powerful thing on the planet.


KING
And how does someone like yourself make
use of the stem cells, Chris?

REEVE
Well, it's very simple.  And now you
can see, my arms have better movement.


KING
Wow.  Wow.

[Five Points, Denver. A bum pushes a cart full of his belongings
past Denver Meat Packing, a rundown warehouse. Sirens, gunshots,
and a woman's screams are heard.]

JIMMY
Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a
group of people called the Crips.


BUM
You are?

JIMMY
Do you know where they meet? We've already
tried the rec center and the library.


BUM
The Crips hang out at that old warehouse
down there,  but ...nobody goes in there.


JIMMY
Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves.
Come on, Tim-Tim.

TIMMY
Timmmih!

[Denver Meat Packing, inside. The music is thumping, there's
gambling and general conversation going on. Jimmy and Timmy walks
in]

JIMMY
Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson,
and this is my friend Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih.

JIMMY
Well, let us tell you a little bit
about ourselves. Timmy and I are both
true Crips, born and raised. We're the
only Crips in South Park, where we live,
and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc
Denver chapter.

LARGE CRIP
Is they for real, manh?

JIMMY
We just have one question before we
join your c-club. Do you think it's
better to be born a Crip, or to become
a Crip later by accident?

BRAIDED CRIP
The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.


TALL CRIP
Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident,
fool!

JIMMY
I agree. I mean, it's like  "come on"!
Why do these people who become crippled
later in life think they're such great
pot-potatuhs?

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Well, we're glad you see it our way,
fellas. So can we join your g... group?


BUFF CRIP
All right, you wanna thug with the Five
Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta
do is pop some punk-ass Bloods.

JIMMY
Well, sure. Tim and I would love to
pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific
at it.

TIMMY
Timmih?

JIMMY
I don't know, Timmy, just play along.


TIMMY
Uh-tu-Timmih!

BUFF CRIP
So you sayin' yuh down?

JIMMY
Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down
like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww...
Down like a clown, Charlie Browh...
Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie
Br-Brown.

JIMMY
Say Timmy, did you notice that all the
crippled people in that club are negros?


TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I
mean, there's not one crippled colored
person in South Park.

OFFICER
Hey you kids.

JIMMY
Well hello, officers.

OFFICER
What the hell do you think you're doin'?


JIMMY
We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.


TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Look, Timmy. There's a convenience
store.  That must be what the fellas
meant by "pop some punk-ass Bloods."
They want us to get them some soda pop
and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale
and marshmallows. Then they'll let us
in the club for sure.

TIMMY
Oh, Timmih.

DRIVER
Oh shit!

JIMMY
Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!


[back at Denver Meat Packing, night. Jimmy and Timmy are back
at the warehouse]

BUFF CRIP
Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell
you about my little Gs, Roller and 4
Legs here. They just smoked thirteen
Bloods in one night!

CRIP 1
One night?

CRIP 2
You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One
night?

BUFF CRIP
That ain't never been done before!


58 CRIP
And they got us marshmallows and ginger
ale.

CRIPS
Uh huh. Cool. He's right.

JIMMY
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?


BUFF CRIP
You're not just in, you're the baddest
mofo Crips in town! Cipac!  Turn up
the beat so we can celebrate our new
Gs Five-Points style!

CIPAC
All right.

JIMMY
Wow, these guys really are crippled.
Timmy, I have a feeling that this is
the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.


TIMMY
Timmih!

[Jimmy's home. A car drives up and drops off Timmy and Jimmy.
The occupants are Crips]

JIMMY
Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We
sure had a ...terrific time.

CIPAC
Alrighty. Keep it real though, dawg.


JIMMY
You dawgs keep it real, too.

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
Well, that sure was a terrific time.
Let's go all around tomorrow and show
everyone our new outfits, Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmih!

[Jimmy's house, inside. His parents sit before the TV, his mom
worried]

MOM
There you are, Jimmy!

JIMMY
Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?

POPS
Jimmy, you rmother was gettin' worried
about you.

JIMMY
No need to worry about me. I'm cool
like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool.


[Outside, somewhere, day. A reporter begings speaking to the
camera]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem
Cell Research Facility with terrific
news. Christopher Reeve, who was once
paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.


REEVE
Thank you everyone.  To most people,
this is just an ordinary fetus. But
to people like me,  it's hope.

CROWD
Uugh.

[Reeve tosses the carcass away, then he drops his feet to the
floor, then he slowly rises from his wheelchair and raises his
arms in victory. The crowd oooos and ahhhs]

MR. GARRISON
What an inspiration.

REPORTER
Tom, many celebrities have spoken out
in protest of stem-cell research, but,
after seeing this, how can they protest
now?

STAN
Stay clear, guys, stay clear.

KYLE
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.

[City Wok, day. Mr. Kim is wiping the counter down. Timmy and
Jimmy enter dressed in their Crip outfits.]

MR. KIM
Hey  Hey, I don't want no trouber!


JIMMY
Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung
...Pao Chicken, please.

MR. KIM
I don't want no trouble! You jus...

TIMMY
Timmih!

MR. KIM
OH! Okay, okay!  I opening register

JIMMY
Actually, it was a regular lemonade.


MR. KIM
AAAAAGH-agh!!  I sorry! I sorry! I

Now go, just go!

JIMMY
Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.


TIMMY
Timmih!

MR. KIM
Hello! Police? I've just been robbed
by two gang members!

[Jimmy's house, later. His parents are standing by the kitchen's
breakfast nook sipping coffee. A door opens in the living room,
then closes]

POPS
Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the
kitchen please?

JIMMY
Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?

POPS
Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and
I need to talk to you.  Son, your mother
and I have noticed a change in your
behavior. And... we're worried that
you might be involved in a gang.

JIMMY
A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well
sure. But I can't talk about the club
on account of it's sssuper secret, dawg.


MAMSIE
Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true!


JIMMY
Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come
on. I'm finally a part of something,
very much.

RYAN
Jimmy, those people you're hanging out
with are no good.

JIMMY
Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg.
They're my f... friends.

MAMSIE
And what about your standup comedy,
Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on
that, too?

JIMMY
Nobody cared about my standup comedy!
All that hard work just to be outshined
by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!


RYAN
Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God
made you the way he did for a reason!


JIMMY
Right. Because you and Mom used to make
fun of crippled kids in high school.


RYAN
That's right. You were sent here through
the vengeful and angry hand of God to
teach your mother and I a lesson. And
that's a big responsibility, son.


JIMMY
Look! My gang, which I can't talk about
because it's super secret, is the most
important thing to me now! And if you
two don't like it, you can just pass
the blunt to the nigga on your left.


[A darkened lab. Christopher Reeve is pacing back and forth,
having a headache.]

REEVE
Where's that delivery of new fetuses?!
Feeling weak again.

AIDE
Here's the new shipment, sir.  Hey!


MAN
Hello there, Christopher.

REEVE
Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis
from the movies. How are you?

HACKMAN
I'm good. You?

REEVE
I am better with each passing day.
Stronger and more agile.

HACKMAN
Christopher, I've come to ask you to
stop what you're doing?

REEVE
What?

HACKMAN
Using stem cells is like playing God.
You should leave nature alone.

REEVE
And go back to the way I was? Is that
what you're saying, Hackman?

HACKMAN
I'm saying that sometimes you need to
just live with the cards you're dealt,
Christopher.

REEVE
Stop calling me Christopher! That name
no longer has meaning to me! Christopher
was someone who lived in a wheelchair!
Always being pushed around by others!
The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From
now on, I am...  Chris!

[Jimmy's house, night, living room. He sits on the floor between
the couch and the coffee table working on a jigsaw puzzle]


JIMMY
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on
the wall. Six-

BLOOD
Payback time, mothafucka!

JIMMY
Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!
Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta.


BLOOD
East Side Bloods!

HYDE
We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson
from the Special Gang unit in Denver.


JIMMY
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's
houses, officer?

RICHARDSON
Word on the street is it was a retaliation
hit by the Bloods.

JIMMY
The... B-Bloods?

HYDE
You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang!
The Bloods are at war with the Crips,
they kill each other all the time!


JIMMY
The-they do??

RICHARDSON
Don't act like you don't know, you lil
punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each
other, and if you stay in that gang,
you're gonna end up dead too.

JIMMY
But... but why do they hate each other?


HYDE
Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself,
but I'm not anymore!

JIMMY
Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher
Reeve?

HYDE
Come on. The only way these kids are
gonna get out of their gang is get killed.


RYAN
Sarah!

JIMMY
Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never
started a gang for people crippled from
birth. Now they're at war with the people
who are crippled from an accident. Boy
were we wrong.

TIMMY
Tim-mih.

JIMMY
Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy.
We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods
to sstop fighting. I bet if we could
just get them together... but how? Wu-wait
a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at
the rec center! We did it for our church
once. All we do is rent out the rec
center overnight. They lock the doors
so nobody can leave, and then everyone
has the whole night to play in the swimming
pool and laugh and talk.

TIMMY
Timmih!!

JIMMY
You get all the Crips you can to the
rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And
I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.


TIMMY
Timmih!!

JIMMY
This is gonna be t-terrific!

[South Park, next day, in from ot Tom's Rhinoplasty]

REPORTER
Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher
Reeve had a horrible accident and was
paralyzed. The irony, of course, is
that the man who played Superman could
no longer walk. America watched in wonder
as he managed to move one of his fingers,
then his arms. And now, seen for the
first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve
is going to lift a truck up over his
head.

RANDY
Oh, what a fighter.

KYLE'S FATHER
That brave, brave man.

LIANE
He's an imspration to us all.

REPORTER
Tom, the irony is even more irony-y
as it appears that the stem cells have
given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman
strength.

HACKMAN
Chris, that's enough!

REEVE
Hello, Gene! So good to see you!

HACKMAN
You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop
using stem cells.

REEVE
Stem-cell research has made me stronger
than I ever thought possible! Why stop
now?!

REPORTER
Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the
man who played Superman's enemy Lex
Luthor in the movies, has now shown
up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell
research. If that isn't ironic, Tom,
I don't knw what is.

HACKMAN
They're affecting your mind, Chris.
If you won't stop using stem cells,
then we'll stop you!

REEVE
Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't
stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha
haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!

REPORTER
Tom, if irony were made of strawberries,
we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies
right now.

[Denver Recreation Center, night. Gang members file through the
doors. Jimmy and Timmy greet everyone at the door. Timmy is disgusied
as Groucho Marx, Jimmy wears a ten-gallon hat.]

JIMMY
Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises
and t-treats inside.  Great to see you
all. What a terrific audience.

JANITOR
Are you sure you got everything you
need, young man?

JIMMY
We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.


MR. APPLEBY
Just remember to make sure the kids
play safe in the pool area.

JIMMY
You bet.

MR. APPLEBY
I'll be back at seven to let you out.
You kids have a good time.

JIMMY
Oh, we will.

[Denver Recreation Center, inside. A group of Bloods enter the
gym and stop in their tracks. At the other end of the gym is
a group of Crips, seated on some bleachers behind a basketball
hoop. The Crips stand in reply]

BUFF CRIP
The Bloods!

BLOOD 1
Oh shit! It's a trap!

BLOOD 2
Muthafucka Crips tryin' to smoke us
all out!

CRIP
What the hell is goin' on here?

JIMMY
It's called a lock-in at the rec center.
We can use all the rec center facilities.
We can play basketball, go swimming,
or even just kick it in the lounge area
with some games and ...p-puzzles.


TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
But nobody can leave until it's seven
a.m., so if you wanna have a good time,
you're all just gonna have to learn
to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.


[Nighttime, near the city. The reporter stands next to a man-made
lake]

REPORTER
Tom, over five years ago, doctors told
Christopher Reeve that he would never
walk again, but the resilient actor
fought back, struggled against all odds,
and has now built his very own Legion
of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's
new organization will be commited to
world domination and evil. What an inspirational
story, Tom.

[Legion of Doom Headquarters, inside. Christopher Reeve is standing
before a group of villains, both real and imagined.]

REEVE
I have chosen each member of this elite
group of supervillains for their outstanding
treachery,  Their desire for world conquest,
and their hatred of all things good!
And I've assembled this group for one
purpose! To once and for all find a
way to...  get rid of Hack Man!!


DR. DOOM
Uhhh, how about domination of the world?


SADDAM HUSSEIN
Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?


REEVE
Silence! OUR job is to see to it that
Hack Man is put out of commission.


PROFESSOR CHAOS
Oh boy, General Disarray, muh maybe
we just oughtta stay outta this one.


HACKMAN
Not so fast, Chris!

REEVE
Hack Man!

HACKMAN
We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell
research. Your fetus-sucking days are
over!

REEVE
No...  NOOOO!

HACKMAN
And now we're goingn to put you somewhere
where you can never touch another fetus
again!

[Denver Recreation Center, inside. The Bloods and Crips challenge
each other.]

BUFF CRIP
You stupid mofos are dead!

BLOOD 3
Make the first shot, punk!

JIMMY
Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter
if we were crippled from birth, or crippled
in an accident. We're all brothers.


BLOOD 4
Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers!


JIMMY
Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves.
Can't we all just try having some fun
together?

58 CRIP
You talkin' crazy, dawg.

BLOOD 5
Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!

JIMMY
Why don't we at least give it a chance?
I mean,  Come on!

BUFF CRIP
Wait a minute. What did you say?

JIMMY
I said, "I mean,  Come on!"

BLOOD 4
You know, maybe he's right. I mean,
Come on!

JIMMY
Come on.

BUFF CRIP
I guess we could at least give havin'
fun together a try. It's like  Come
on.

BLOOD 6
Yeah. Come on.

CRIP 2
Yeah, that's right. Come on.

JIMMY
Come on.

SOMEONE
Come on.

ALL
Yeah, that's right. Come on.

BUFF CRIP
I've gotta give you two dawgs props
for puttin' an end to all this hate.


JIMMY
I told you, lock-ins at the rec center
always work. And you know, I've learned
something, too. I was player-hatin'
Christopher Butthole Reeve because he
got more attention than me. But just
like... y-you guys, I need to learn
to control my a... anger.

BLOOD
Right on!

CRIP
Hey little Roller, try some of this
chronic shit.

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMMY
I guess we all learned that trying to
get along is way better than p... player
hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about
it. Why don't we listen in?

GANG MEMBERS
It used to be that Crips and Bloods
didn't get along,

But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song.

Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love.


Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.

[Outer space. Christopher Reeve is flung into space in a pane
of glass.]

REEVE
You haven't seen the last of me, Hack
Man! I will be back!!

[The woods near South Park, night. Stan and friends watch the
celestial spectacle]

STAN
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of
that one.

KYLE
Mee tooo.

"THE ENTITY"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Denver International Airport, day. Inside the terminal people
are in long lines waiting to get their tickets or get on a plane.
Mr. Garrison waits in line to have his bags scanned.]

MR. GARRISON
Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous!
I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse
me, there are two other security checkpoints.
Why can't you open those, too?

SECURITY GUARD
Uh I don't know nothin'.

MR. GARRISON
But you work for the-  uh, God-damnit!!


VOICE
Snooty Airlines announces the arrival
of flight 239 from Connecticut.

[The Broflovskis stand in front of a perfume shop]

KYLE'S MOTHER
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold
the sign up nice and high so he can
find us.

KYLE
What's he look like?

KYLE'S MOTHER
He's your age and about your height.


KYLE
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live
with us. It'll be just like having a
brother.

IKE
I todd a nurra

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, there he is.  Over here, Kyle!


BOY
Hello, Aunt Sheila.

KYLE'S MOTHER
How was your flight?

BOY
:	Oh, it was terrible. They they recycled
the air on board and it really did a
number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them
to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't.


KYLE'S MOTHER
You rememer uncle Gerry.

BOY
:	Hi, Uncle Gerry.

KYLE'S MOTHER
:	 And these are your cousin, Ike and
Kyle

KYLE
Hey dude.

BOY
It's nice to meet you.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Let's get down to the baggage claim,
Kyle.

BOTH BOYS
Okay:

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles
now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and
you can be Kyle...  Two!

KYLE TWO
Cool.

[Ticket counter. Mr. Garrison's turn has come up and he approaches
the counter]

CLERK
Next?

MR. GARRISON
Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon.


CLERK
Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne
has boarded. Looks like you didn't make
it.

MR. GARRISON
What? Well of course I didn't make it.
The line to check in was two hours long,
and the security line was two hours
more!

CLERK
Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get
you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.


MR. GARRISON
I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is
tonight!

CLERK
Would you like a window or an aisle
seat?

MR. GARRISON
This is unbelievable! You know, I seem
to remember when the airlines said,
"We need a 15 billion dollar bailout
from the taxpayers-"!

CLERK
Mmokay, and have any of your personal
items been out of your possession since
you left?

MR. GARRISON
Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar
bailout and they fired their employees
anyway! So now we have three people
to clear 400 passengers!

MAN
Hey,he's right!

PEOPLE
YEAH!

CLERK
Okay, and bags have been with you at
all times?

MR. GARRISON
So where did that money go? I'll tell
you where it went: it went into the
pockets of the preseidents and CEOs
of the airlines, so they can keep their
miltimillion dollar salaries!

PEOPLE
YEAH!

CLERK
And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow
morning.

MR. GARRISON
You think you can treat us however you
want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll
tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna
come up with a NEW mode of transportation!
A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put
all you bastards out of business!


PEOPLE
YEAH! ALRIGHT! GO!

MR. GARRISON
You think I can't do it?! I got a master's
degree in mechanical engineering at
Denver Community College! You watch
me!!  Come on, everybody!

PEOPLE
YEAH!

MAN
Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?


[The Broflovski house, night. The family is seated around the
dining room table as Sheila enters with soup in hand]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours,
Kyle.

KYLE
Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?

KYLE TWO
Mom's special stew. She makes it every
Monday and I love it.

KYLE
Oh is, is this beef?

KYLE TWO
Yeah, dude, it's great!

KYLE
Uha, wa, actually, I, I can't eat beef.
I have a degenerative problem with my
intestinal lining, and beef really gives
me gaass.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can
I fix you?

KYLE
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother,
I uh-

KYLE'S MOTHER
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice
pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?

KYLE
We-ull, some fish would be great if
it isn't too much trouble.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I'll put it in the microwave right
away.

[Kitchen, moments later. Sheila has gotten the fish and breaks
it apart on the kitchen counter. Kyle Two appears at the doorway]


KYLE TWO
Mom?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, Kyle Two?

KYLE TWO
How am I related to him again?

KYLE'S MOTHER
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you
already.

KYLE TWO
Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant
cousin?

KYLE'S MOTHER
He's my sister's son. That makes him
your first cousin.

KYLE TWO
So we have the same blood?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is
going through a very tough time in his
life. His mother is very sick and he's
in a whole new place. He's going to
rely on you to make sure he fits in
at your school.

KYLE TWO
What?? How the hell am I supposed to
do that??

KYLE'S MOTHER
I'm sure your friends will love him.


KYLE TWO
What about Cartman, huh? He rips on
me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear
this kid apart!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.


KYLE TWO
Oh my God.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I'm sure you two will become great friends
with lots of late night pillow talk.


KYLE TWO
Well what do you mean?  What room is
he sleeping in?

[Kyle's room, past bed time. Both Kyles are in bed, the cousin
getting used to the bed.]

KYLE
What's this comforter filled with? Um,
it isn't filled with down, is it?


KYLE TWO
I don't know, dude.

KYLE
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains
and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?


KYLE TWO
I don't think so.

KYLE
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and
put them on the night stand. Make sure
they're close by, because that fish
upset my stomach and I might need them
if I have to go to he bathroom later
on.

KYLE TWO
Okay.

[Mr. Garrison's house, night. He's working at an artist's desk
in his bedroom. On the wall are drawings of various types of
aircraft, and on the floor around him are bits and pieces of
all kinds of vehicles, including bicycle gears, airplane propellers,
car motors, a muffler. To his right is a dresser with a small
color TV on top. Mr. Hat is present on his right hand, as always.]


MR. GARRISON
Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped,
but with the ability to travel at much
faster speeds. The designs of our electrical
moped were altered with a- no, nonono
this won't work either!

MR. HAT
What was wrong with that plan?

MR. GARRISON
It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A
moped would be too dangerous at those
speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet
power of an aircraft could be scaled
down into a personal vehicle?

MR. HAT
Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure
gyrate his hot ass around.

ENRIQUE IGLESIAS
...I think about you day and night.
I think about you...

MR. GARRISON
Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling
over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a
minute. What did you say?

MR. HAT
I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate
his hot ass!

MR. GARRISON
That's it. Gyration.  A gyrascope.
It would allow for maximum balance and
yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's
so simple and yet genius!

MR. HAT
Check out his hot bulge, too.

[Bus stop, next day. Kenny, Stan and Cartman wait at the stop.
The two Kyles walk up to them.]

STAN
Hey dude.

CARTMAN
What's that thing?

KYLE TWO
Cartman, I need to talk to you.

KYLE
Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.

KYLE TWO
Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.


CARTMAN
What?

KYLE TWO
That kid over there is my cousin from
the East Coast. He's having a really
hard time right now, so I'm going to
offer you forty dollars to not rip on
him.

CARTMAN
Forty bucks?

KYLE TWO
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL.
No smartass comments, nothin'.

CARTMAN
Alrigh, alright.

KYLE TWO
And you especially can't say anythng
about Jews!

CARTMAN
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off
my balls?

KYLE TWO
Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have
to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've
got forty bucks! Can you do it?

KYLE
I can't believe how cold it is out here.


CARTMAN
Cold be tough. But I'll give it a shot.


KYLE TWO
Alright.

KYLE
It's a reall dry cold; that's the problem.
It- the cold air makes me wheeze.


KYLE TWO
Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of...
friend- ish.

KYLE
Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh
you know, I saw that same jacket you're
wearing at Bosco's for 29.95. How much
was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering
if Bosco's is a ripoff?

CARTMAN
...Oh, man.

KYLE
Cartman?!

CARTMAN
Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I
can certainly tell you're a relative
of my good friend Kyle here.

STAN
What the hell was that?

[Neighborhood, day. Barbardy stops Craig's father in his car
and is writing out a ticket when the large wheel zips by them.]


OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh what the hell was that?

[Dowtown South Park. People walk about doing stuff. The giant
wheel zips by them as well, but few seem to notice.]

STUART
What the hell was that?

RANDY
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't
see it.  But I want one.

STUART
Yep, me too.

[Garrison's house, curb level. The giant wheel stops and two
legs dismount. It's Mr. Garrison, beaming with pride and confidence]


MR. GARRISON
We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies
be damned. We've invented a whole new
mode of transportation! Get some investors
on the phone!  Well what are you waiting
for?!

[South Park Elementary, day. Class is now in session.]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
And I know you'll all be very nice to
our new student.  Kyle, why don't you
tell us a little about yourself?

KYLE
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah
ah I really don't care for it. Ah I
come from a Jewish family, which of
course you already know, because Kyle's
form the same family.  I like to read,
and I have these polyps on the backs
of my hands - I don't know what they
are.

CARTMAN
Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm
not gonna make it.

KYLE
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment
banker.

CARTMAN
I... must.. fight it! Need... forty...
dollars!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay, why don't you go ahead and take
a seat, Kyle?

KYLE
Uh where should I sit? There's no place
to sit down here.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Yes, unfortunately the school seems
to be completely out of extra desks.
So you'll just have to share with your
cousin.

KYLE TWO
What?

KYLE
Eh, oh, alright.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now let's get on with our lesson on
the-

KYLE
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available?
I usually prefer the plastic ones because
these give me splinters.

CARTMAN
Ugh, ugh!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to
make do.  Now let's get back to the
le-

KYLE
Is it cold in here? I realize we're
in the mountains, but do we have to
freeze to death?

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In
my class you need to be able to concentrate.


CARTMAN
Oh!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Concentration is the key to succeeding
in my class.

CARTMAN
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration
camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!


KYLE TWO
CARTMAN!

[News 4 Newsbreak. An anchor soon appears with a window of Mr.
Garrsion beside him]

ANCHOR
Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison
has apparently invented a new vehicle
that will give the airlines a run for
their money. Mr. Garrison is putting
the final touches on his top secret
device, which he simply calls "IT".
So what exactly is "IT"?  Here with
a report is a Hispanic man with some
gravy stains on his lapel.

HISPANIC REPORTER
Thanks, Tom, I-oh...  Thanks, Tom. So
far Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone
get a look at his invention. He claims
that the vehicle is sooo genius and
revolutionary that it could cause one's
eyes to bleed if not properly prepared
to see it. But earlier today HBC News
got footage of some of the country's
top investors and richest people who
have been invited for a first look,
including: Steve Forbes , Steve Jobs
, Ted Turner , Donald Trump , Bill Gates
, and Yasmine Bleeth . Their curiosity
is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What
is "IT"? What does "IT"do? And when
will IT be somewhere where I can buy
one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando ,
HBC News.

[Playground, day. Kids are on swings, hobby elephants, slides,
etc, as the camera pans across. At the end of the pan, Kyle and
Kyle Two face each other in a clearing]

KYLE TWO
You need to learn to play some sports,
Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough
one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw
the football to you; you throw it back
to me.

KYLE
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making
the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna
hurt my hands.

KYLE TWO
It's fine!

KYLE
Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?


KYLE TWO
Ih it's a football, dude. You just-
put your arms out and catch it.  Alright,
here we go.

KYLE
Now what?

KYLE TWO
Now throw it back to me.

KYLE
But it's down in the snow.

KYLE TWO
...So dig it out.

KYLE
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then
it will melt and I'll have wet hands.


KYLE TWO
...Well, then we'll dry them off!

KYLE
Alright, then.

KYLE TWO
Oh my God.

CARTMAN
Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that
in World War II, some Jewish people
were sent to concentration camps.


KYLE TWO
Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that.
But I understand now how you might've
felt what I said in the classroom was
a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.


KYLE TWO
You did, too! You are so full of crap!


CARTMAN
No, I'm seriously! Becuase, um, I was,
I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was
all like, "Hey, did you know that in
World War II they really HAD concentration
camps?" And I was all like, "No way!"
And this little light went on in my
head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought
what I said in the class, seemed like
it was directed at his cousin." But,
but I was literally talkin' about a
concentration camp, you know, where
you go for a week to learn and focus,
you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding,
huh?

KYLE TWO
You blew the deal, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, give me another chance!


KYLE TWO
Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make
fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you
the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You
ripped on him, deal's off!

KYLE
Uh you did what?

KYLE TWO
Oh no.

CARTMAN
Haha,  serves you right, asshole.


KYLE
You, you paid your friends tuh...  not
make fun of me?

KYLE TWO
Look, ih it's not because anything's
wrong with you.

KYLE
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars
to get people to like me.

KYLE TWO
Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry

KYLE
Becuase I m-I mean I really think you
could have done it for about 12.50.


KYLE TWO
What?

KYLE
Well, I mean, you didn't just start
at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball
these things so you have a place to
go.

KYLE TWO
Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh

KYLE
Boy it sure is dry out here.

[Mr. Garrison's house, backyard. The invited guest sit in two
rows of chairs]

MR. GARRISON
Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel
safely at incredibly fast speeds, and
not having to go to the stupid fartface
airports!

MR. HAT
That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.


MR. GARRISON
It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what
makes IT possible  is IT's patented
gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give
you, IT!

GUESTS
Whoa.

STEVE FORBES
Nice

DONALD TRUMP
Sweet.

MR. GARRISON
IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon,
and is safely capable of speeks of over
200 miles per hour.

GUESTS
Whoa. Wow.

BILL GATES
This will change everything.

STEVE JOBS
We're going to have to rethnk cities!


MR. GARRISON
Now, IT is easily operated using four
flexigrip handles. Two of them are on
each side. Left side for throttle, right
side for steering.  The third flexigrip
is gently inserted into the anus, to
keep the driver in place.

GUESTS
Ugh. Oh.

MR. GARRISON
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip
is directly in front of the driver so
that its small switches can be operaterd
with the mouth, as such.  Put the four
together and we're ready to go.

STEVE JOBS
Oh my God!

STEVE FORBES
Look at it go!

BILL GATES
But the way it works... do you think
people will go through that to travel?


STEVE FORBES
Hey, it... still beats what you go through
at the airports.

GUEST 1
True.

GUEST 2
Yup.

GUEST 3
Yeah, that's true.

GUEST 4
Yeap.

[The Broflovski house, night. Two lights are on]

[Kyle Two's room. Stan is writing in a book as Kyle speaks]


KYLE TWO
I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's
been here for two weeks and he's driving
me insane.

STAN
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants
to kick his ass.

KYLE TWO
Ispent five years in this town making
a good name for Jews and this... this...
stereotype shows up and wrecks it all!
You know what my biggest fear is? That
I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms
will start rubbing off on me, and I'll
become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew
and he's making me hate Jews.

STAN
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming
a stereotype.

KYLE TWO
Ya see?

KYLE
I'm ba-ack!

KYLE TWO
Ugh.

STAN
Book. Later, dude.

[South Park, day. The day for IT's unveiling is here, and it's
being offered at Better Buy. Another camera focuses on the Hispanic
reporter]

JEFF ARRANDO
Tom, the day is finally here. IT has
arrived for retail sale, and people
are getting their first look at it.


MR. GARRISON
:	 Okay, good. Just step through here
And then this is your steering and
here's your throttle.

CRAIG'S FATHER
Okay.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little
pinch.

CRAIG'S FATHER
HAAAOW!

MR. GARRISON
It's alright, it's just locking you
in.  You can take it.  Doing great,
Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use
your mouth to operate the turn signals,
and you're off.  Great! Who else wants
to give it a spin?

[In front of Better Buy. IT drivers move about as Randy and Stuart
look on. Craig's father rolls to a stop next to them]

RANDY
Oh, man, it that the IT?

CRAIG'S FATHER
Hehyeah.

STUART
How is it?

CRAIG'S FATHER
Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with
the airline companies, that's for sure.


[Neighborhood, day. The boys have Kyle on a sled, which is tied
to...]

KYLE
I don't know about this, guys. I think
sleds are dangerous.

KYLE TWO
Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all
kids out here do. You've gotta learn.


KYLE
It seems like I might get splinters,
though.

KYLE TWO
Remember: Just hold on. No matter how
long the sledding run lasts, hold on.


KYLE
Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled
is going faaaast.

KYLE TWO
Hang on!

KYLE
I have to watch out for my glasses.
Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus!

KYLE TWO
How far do you thnk it is to Connecticut?


KYLE
It's a least a couple of hours.

KYLE TWO
Think he'll be alright.

CARTMAN
He's faaahn.

[Commercial]

ANNOUNCER
Are you tired of coprporate airline
companies treating you like a worthless
sardine?  Tired of ridiculous lines
and horrible security at airports?
Well, now there is an alternative to
airline travel.  IT.  IT has taken the
country by storm.  And already two million
have been sold.  Never have another
important business trip ruined by airline
incompetence.  Hey ladies! How did you
get to the Grand Canyon?  IT comes in
sizes for the entire family.

WOMAN
Here you go, Robby.

JOHN TRAVOLTA
Hello, I'm John Travolta. I used to
rely on airlines to get me to set, but
once I got used to IT,  I found it to
be a little less painful than dealing
with the airline companies. I just power
up the flexigrips.  And I'm ready to
go. Thank you, IT.

ANNOUNCER
So join the millions of Americans who
have felt a little more comfortable
with... traveling.  Order yours today
and remember our slogan: IT's better
than flying.

[Kyle's house, living room. Kyle Two has finished watching the
commercial]

KYLE TWO
...Hm, that was pretty gay.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle Two, where is Kyle?

KYULE TWO
I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw
him he was sledding.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Where on earth could he be?

KYLE TWO
You know, it's just possible he went
back to Conencticut.

KYLE'S MOTHER
What?

KYLE TWO
Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried
about his mom that found a way to get
back and see her.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's
out playing with his new friends.


KYLE TWO
I'm just throwin' it out there as a
possibility.

KYLE
I'm ba-ack.

KYLE TWO
AAA!

KYLE
I'm sorry. You must've been worried
sick. I got your sled tangled up with
a bus.

KYLE TWO
A, a bus. R-really?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, what happened to you??

KYLE
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next
thing I knew my sled rope got tangled
with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over
a hundred miles before the bus finally
stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your
sled, Kyle.

KYLE TWO
Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and
we'll get you out of those wet clothes.
Are you alright?

KYLE
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen
off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid
from sitting on the sled for so long.


[IT dealership, day. The IT has grown so popular it's left Better
Buy for its own sale space. The camera pans across the showroom
floor to Mr. Garrison, seated in front of an IT Moters Inc. sign.
He's got a stack of bills to his right and a computer to his
left, all on a futuristic desk]

MR. GARRISON
We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in
the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo.
Can I help you?

JIMBO
Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm
for my IT.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, right, right. Take a seat.

JIMBO
Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.

MR. GARRISON
What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set
to put a down payment on that baby?


RANDY
Well, yeah, but I have one question
about the way it works.

MR. GARRISON
Sure.

RANDY
Well,  it seems all the buttons on these
front and rear flexigrips are also found
on the side of the vehicle.

MR. GARRISON
Yeup.

RANDY
Well... so... they don't really...
do anything.

MR. GARRISON
Right.

RANDY
So then, couldn't I just order one that
works without going in and out of my
ass and mouth?

MR. GARRISON
Well, I... guess you could.

MAN 1
Huh?

MAN 2
Whazzat?

MAN 3
Wha- what did you- what did he say?


MAN 4
What?

[Denver International Airport, day. A plane takes off. Inside
the terminal the boys and Kyle stand around]

KYLE
I don't know about this guys. I think
playing hide and seek in the airport
might be dangerous.

KYLE TWO
Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado
all play hide and seek at the airport.


STAN
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse
you'll see how fun it is.

KYLE TWO
Ungh, this is taking too long. The
flight to Connecticut is about to leave.
Ey! Can we speed things up here??


SECURITY GUARD
Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT
thing came out the airlines have had
to cut back on employees.

KYLE TWO
Dude, we're the only ones here! How
long does it take five people through
security?!

SECURITY GUARD
Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus...
times... divided... two hours domestic,
three hours international.

KYLE
Can't we just play hide and seek at
home?

KYLE TWO
No!

SECURITY GUARD
Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper!
Die, terrorist!

KYLE
Oh, Jesus!!

SECURITY GUARD
See, we do these checks for a reason!


KYLE TWO
This is ridiculous! Come on!

[Tarmac, outside. The boys stop at a plane ready to take off.]


KYLE TWO
Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting.


CARTMAN
1, 2, 3, 4...

KYLE TWO
Here, Kyle. You go hide in here.


KYLE
In there? But it's very confined. I'll
get cramps in my legs.

KYLE TWO
JUST GET IN THE BOX!

KYLE
Ub, alright then.  Oh, would you look
at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.
Now where did that one come from? That's
the fourth one I've had-

KYLE TWO
I hope he doesn't suffocate.

CARTMAN
He's faaahn.

STAN
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back
at home.

KYLE
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!
Oh, I did it again!!

[IT dealership, day. Crowds mill around the dealership. Federal
agents raid the building and start hauling ITs away. Mr. Garrison
isn't pleased.]

MR. GARRISON
Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?


AGENT 1
It's alright, we're with the government.


AGENT 2
We're just shutting you down.

MR. GARRISON
Shutting me down? Why?

AGENT 3
The airlines are in desperate trouble.
Your vehicle is causing them to lose
money.

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry!
Ah-t put that down!

AGENT 4
Right, so the governmentn is bailing
the airlines out again, but shutting
you down and making ITs illegal.

MR. GARRISON
OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding!


AGENT 5
Sir, many people work for the airlines.
We can't let them all be fired.

MR. GARRISON
THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY
BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND
THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!

AGENT 6
That may be truu. But if you build,
sell, or ride another IT, "it" will
be the last time. Have a nice night.


MR. GARRISON
HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs!
You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons
of bitch airlines!

[The Broflovski house, night. In the living room, Sheila paces
the floor as Kyle sits on the sofa.]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?


KYLE TWO
I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished
into thin air.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle
Two, go down to the playground and look
there.

KYLE TWO
I already checked the playground, Ma.
I told you, he isn't really-

KYLE
I'm back.

KYLE TWO
GAAAH!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle!  You're back!

KYLE
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid
myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh,
it was so dry down there.

[The Broflovski house, a few days later. Stan and Cartman approach
the door. Inside, Kyle is standing in the living room, his arms
crossed. He's clearly pissed off. The door opens, and Stan and
Cartman walk in.]

STAN
So dude, did Cartman's idea work?

KYLE TWO
No. I tried getting my cousin lost in
the woods, but a stupid bear brought
him home.

STAN
Damn!

KYLE TWO
I just have to face facts that I'm gointuh
live with my crappy cousin forever.


KYLE
Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.

KYLE TWO
...What?

KYLE
Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Now that things have changed for Kyle,
his mother needs him back.

KYLE TWO
Do you promise??  I mean, oh. Thah-uh
that's too bad, dude. What, what changed
for you?

KYLE
Well, I I invested in that IT thng,
and there was a bailout, so I received
a five million dollar bailout clause
check, which, which I can use to help
my family, so, I I guess, goodbye, cousin.


KYLE TWO
Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya
soon.  Not too soon, I hope.

STAN
Yeah, haha

CARTMAN
Heheheheheh.

ALL THREE
Five million dollars???

KYLE TWO
Dudedudedude! You you have five miliion
dollars??

KYLE
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it,
though. Well, see ya.

KYLE TWO
Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but
I think you should stay!

STAN, CARTMAN
Yeah!

KYLE
Ru really?

KYLE TWO
Yeah. You see, I've learned something
today.  Sometimes people have trouble
fitting in at, at school and,...  and
um... Let's see, what did I learn about?
What did I learn about today?

CARTMAN
I I, I learned that... you shouldn't
judge somebody because... that-no, wait.


KYLE TWO
Nonono, it was good! What were you going
to say?

KYLE
Listen, guys, I appreaciate you wanting
me around, but, the fact of the matter
is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind
of douche bags.

KYLE TWO
... Uhwhat?

KYLE
I mean, yeyou people are all just such
hick jock rednecks; it's just like you

Ah I can't take it. See ya.

KYLE TWO

CARTMAN

Recap

[Priest Maxi is shown at the church podium before the congregation]


ANNOUNCER
Previously on South Park...

PRIEST MAXI
Today, we're going to talk about hell.


[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Saddam appears at Satan's door]


SADDAM
Hello, Satan!

SATAN
Saddam...

[The Broflovski house. Sheila and Kyle are talking]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Us Jews don't believe in hell.

KYLE
...But what if we're wrong?

[South Park Avenue, day. The kids begin crossing the street]


STAN
Let's go.

STAN
...they've killed Kenny!

BUTTERS
And he had sins that he didn't confess!


[Hell, River Styx Condominiums, dinner. Saddam tries to arouse
Satan under the table. Satan swats Saddam's arm away]

SATAN
No, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.

[The church rectory. Preist Maxi is talking to the boys]

PRIEST MAXI
Boys, it is your Christian duty to save
the souls of your friends!

[Hell, River Styx Condominiums, bedtime. Satan and Chris are
in bed]

CHRIS
I love you, Satan.

SATAN
I love you too, Saddam.

SATAN, CHRIS
Wuh?!

[The Pacific Ocean. A man drives a speedboat. Richie Cunningham,
Ralph Malph, and Potsy Weber go along for the ride, and Arthur
Fonzarelli stands behind the boat on water skis. Wait...]

RICHIE
Fonz, there's no way you can jump that
shark with your water skis.

FONZIE
Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.

[The church confessional, day. Cartman opens the penitent door
and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition]


WOMAN
Oh, huhuh.

STAN
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's
gonna save us?

CARTMAN
Well, it looks like we're gonna have
to save everyone in this town ourselves!


[The beach. Richie, Potsy, Ralph, and Joanie are on the shore
watching the boat driver take Fonzie on his stunt. On shore is
a sign posted on a pair of surfboards that reads "GO FONZ!!!"]


JOANIE
Go Fonz!!!

FONZIE
Aaaaaa-!

ANNOUNCER
And now the exciting comclusion of...
South Park.

FONZIE
-aaaaaayy-err.  No!  No!  No!  No!


RICHIE
I told him he couldn't do it.

[South Park Elementary, playground. Cartman stands on a platform
and is preaching to the kids]

CARTMAN
I am saying this because we must be
saved-uh. The LORD is powerful and he
will smote the sinners and send them
to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not
live your life for Him-uh, then to the
lake of fire you shall go-uh!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You see that, parents. Your children
have refused to come into class since
this morning. I'm afraid your son is
the leader, Ms. Cartman.  Apparently
he's read the entire Bible, and now
he's scaring the hell out of everyone.


LIANE
Boopie-kins.  It's time to stop preaching
damnation to everyone, sweetie.

STAN
Don't you guys, um, persecrute our
religous beliefs.

KIDS
Yeah!

SHARON
We are not trying to persecute you kids,
but you're supposed to be in school.


STAN
What purpose does school have? The Bible
says the only goal in this life is to
praise God and get into heaven.

KYLE
Yeah, and this life is short. The afterlife
is forever.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Don't listen to them, kids. You have
to go to school.

CARTMAN
Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He
was a playful school-going eight-year-old.
And then yesterday, he was  smacked
down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped
him right to the fiery depths of hell.
So when will you go?! Tomorrow?! Ten
years?! Does it mattah?! No! Because
unless you give this life to the Lord,
that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But
we cannot worship God in that church
where that priest of sin resides,  so
we will build a new church-uh. With
crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high,
and a slide that connects this part
hmya  to this part hmya . Who will help
us?

KIDS
I will.

CARTMAN
Praise God-uh!

[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan is seen looking at the
Bargain Hotel Saddam is in]

SATAN
If I go spend the night with Saddam,
then it's over between me and Chris.
Chris has been so nice to me and I
know Saddam will just hurt me again.
M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam.
I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need
closure.  What am I doing??

SADDAM
What took yo so long, baby??

SATAN
Saddam, I'm just here to talk.

SADDAM
Great! Let's talk!  Hm, this bed is
comfy-bumpy.

SATAN
Saddam, I only came here because I need
closure.

SADDAM
Sounds fun. You know meI'll try anything.


SATAN
No! Saddam, listen to me.

SADDAM
Would you like a drink?

SATAN
Um maybe just- a little one.  I have
to go back soon. I need you to understand
that we can't be together anymore.
I need you to not come by the condo
and not try to see me. Chris thinks
we can all be friends, but I don't.
And I have to focus on Chris now.  What
is this?

SADDAM
These hotels have all kinds of crazy
channels.

SATAN
Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris
is a great person. He's the one I wanna
be with now.

SADDAM
Really? So then... What are you doing
here?  Well I don't know about you,
but this video is gettin' me pretty
hot!

SATAN
Saddam...

SADDAM
Here, have another drink.

[Hell, Bargain Hotel, Saddam's room. Satan is sleeping away peacefully]


SATAN
Ooh, whoa. God, my head. Drank too
much.  Chris!  Oh no!!

SADDAM
Man, look at that! We went through
14 bottles of vegetable oil!  Ewuh,
I'm all greasy.

SATAN
Oh God, what time is it?!

SADDAM
Last night was awesome! Are we together
again now?

SATAN
I don't know. I, I guess so, but now
I have to go home and tell Chris.


SADDAM
Screw him!!

SATAN
No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation!
I jusst don't know what I'm gonna say.


SADDAM
I know how to solve this little problem.


[The Baja California coast, Mexico, day. The camera pans slowly
to the right.]

DRIVER
We are now entering Ensenada, the second
largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula.
We have now traveled over 2000 miles
since leaving New York City. We'll just
be stopping here for a few moments for
gas, and then our tour will continue
on to its final destination.

ATTENDANT
Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus.


DRIVER
Quey? What's stuck to the bottom of
the bus?

KENNY
(Ahow!)

DRIVER
Oh, goodness! We must have run over
a little Mexican further up north. Is
it okay?

ATTENDANT
Pienso que sí.

DRIVER
Well, here's fifty for the gas.  Adios.


KENNY
(Where am I?)

ATTENDANT
¿Qué?

KENNY
(WHERE AM I?)

ATTENDANT
¿Qué?

[South Park, day. Cartman's blueprint for his church is shown,
then the camera pans right to show the actual construction. A
bunch of kids work on the structure, using all sorts of things,
including mirrors for wall panels.]

CARTMAN
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is
almost completed.

STAN
There's no way God will want to send
us to hell now.

KYLE
Yeah, this church kicks a- eh- it kicks!


KYLE'S FATHER
Hello, boys.

KYLE
Don't try to take me away again, Mom
and Dad! I told you! I renounced the
Jewish faith!

KYLE'S MOTHER
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that
Eric's mother needs to see you all right
away! Just really quickshe says it's
very important.

CARTMAN
Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to
mine home and see what mine mom wants.


KYLE'S MOTHER
I sure hope this woiks.

[Cartman's house, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle enter. Dialog
from "Not Without My Anus," set to an organ and canned laughter,
is heard as the boys make their way across a living room littered
with toys of all sorts. The room is decorated so that the boys
would forget their "mission" and just play for one afternoon.
Liane shows up with a Cartman favorite.]

LIANE
Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered
dougnut pancake surprise.

STAN
Wow, cool.

CARTMAN
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me,
oh temptress!

LIANE
What?

CARTMAN
This is a distraction from our work
on the church!  Do not think that you
can tempt us with toys  and new games
and tidings of powdered dougnut pancake
surprise! For it is the AFTERLIFE we
have concerned ourselves with!  Not
the pleasures of this earth, but salvarion
in the world aftah!!

STAN
Yeah!

LIANE
Oh. Well,  alrighty then.

[The Cartman kitchen, moments later. Liane enters. Sister Anne
waits with Stan's and Kyle's parents]

LIANE
I... don't think it worked.

ALL
Aw .

[The Cartman living room, moments later.]

CARTMAN
Let us get back to our work at the church
Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.
Hello?

KENNY
(Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help
me, and I'm not foolin' around!)

CARTMAN
Oh my God!!

STAN
What?

CARTMAN
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond
the grave!

STAN
Kenny?!  What's he say?!

KYLE
Ask him what hell is like.

CARTMAN
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell!
Give us every last horrible detail!


KENNY
(Um...)

[Hell, River Styx Condos. Satan has returned, and is outside
the door to his condo]

SATAN
Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at
me. Well, here it goes.

CHRIS
Hey you.

SATAN
Hi, Chris.

CHRIS
You... were out all night.

SATAN
Yeah, I just... spent the night walking
around the marina.

CHRIS
Satan. You know you're not a very good
liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't
you?

SATAN
Yes.

CHRIS
Satan, I understand.

SATAN
What?

CHRIS
I still feel secure and safe with you.


SATAN
Oh, n-NO!

CHRIS
What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.


SATAN
I know.

CHRIS
Well, what more do you want from me?


SATAN
Well-, could you not be such a pussy
about it? I mean, can't you just say
"If you ever see Saddam again, I'll
break your legs!" or, or "I'm gonna
go kick Saddam's ass!" or something?


CHRIS
Satan, I'm a Nineties man. I cry when
I need to. I share my feelings and I
keep my mind open about everything.


SATAN
Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous,
go throw a football around, for Christ's
sake.

CHRIS
Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.


SATAN
Ah-, I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not
you, really, it's, it's me.  You're
the best thing that's ever happened
to me, and for some reason, I just can't
accept that.

SADDAM
Die, pussy!

CHRIS
Aaaah!

SATAN
Chris!  Saddam, what the hell are you
doing?!

SADDAM
There. I got rid of the problem for
you. Now there's no conflict.

SATAN
No! Not like this!

[South Park, day. Cartman's church is finished. Red carpet, purple
doors... His new followers are gathered inside]

CARTMAN
Friends, I have to tell you that last
night I received a phone call from beyond
the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend,
Kennih! Calling from the depths of hell!
And he described what hell is like in
horrid detail-uh.  He said that in hell,
the smell is awful. He said that in
hell, everyone speaks Spanish.

KIDS
Waah!

CARTMAN
He said there is water in hell, but
if you drink it you pee blood out your
ass for seven hours-uh!

KIDS
Whoa!

CARTMAN
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there
are dozens and dozens of little trinket
stores! But they all have the same little
trinkets in them-eh!

KIDS
Waah!

FATHER
Where is our daughter.

DAUGHTER
Dad?

FATHER
Marcy! You're coming home this instant!


CARTMAN
We are saving your daughter from the
clutches of hell, suh!

FATHER
You're not gonna make my daughter part
of your cult!

CARTMAN
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and
then what?!

FATHER
You're just a stupid little fat kid
who thinks that-  Aaaah!

MOTHER
Stephen?  Steven, no!

CARTMAN
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive
us, Lord, for our sins!

KIDS
Forgive us, Lord.

CARTMAN
Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not
send us to hell. We're sorry, Whatever
we did, we're sorry.

MOTHER
Stephen? Stephen??

[Hell, waiting area. Many souls are there, wondering where they
are, and why.]

STEPHEN
Where, where am I?

MAN
Where are we?

MAN 2
No doubt about it...

WOMAN
What's happening??

MAN 3
Oooooooooh!

SPEAKER
Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody
hear me?  Hello? Can everybuh-? Okay.
Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks
like we have about 8,615 of you newbies
today, and for those of you who are
a little confused, uh, you are dead,
and this is hell, so, abandon all hope
and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now
going to start the orientation process,
which will last about-

MAN 4
Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here.
I wa a totally strict and devout Protestant!
I thought we went to heaven!

HELL DIRECTOR
Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.


SOLDIER
I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
Uh, you picked the wrong religion as
well.

MAN 5
Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?


HELL DIRECTOR
I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes,
the Mormons were the correct answer.


CROWD
Awww.

HELL DIRECTOR
So now I'd like to quickly introduce
your new ruler and master for eternity,
Satan!

SATAN
Oooyeah!

CROWD
Aaaaahh!

SATAN
Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday
in hell grows larger as my minions...
my m-minions uh...  muh, I'm sorry. I
just can't do this today. I'm just...
I'm sorry.

HELL DIRECTOR
Uh, okay. Thank you Satan. Now, uh,
let's begin with the Muslims...

CHRIS
Satan!  'Scuse me. Excuse me.

SATAN
Chris!  But I thought you were dead!


CHRIS
Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?


SATAN
Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab
you in-

CHRIS
Hey, it's alright. All that matters
is that I'm back, and we're together
forever. Right?

SATAN
Uh, ...yeah. Gr-great.

CROWD
Awww.

[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is working at a coffee table
in the living room with Clyde Frog and a Bible]

CARTMAN
Let's see. Matthew 15:11. "Not that
which goeth into the mouth defileth
a man; but that which comes OUT of the
mouth defileth a man." That's a good
one, Clyde Frog. Interesting.

LIANE
Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit
you.

CARTMAN
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister,
but I must prepare for my next sermon.


SISTER ANNE
Eric, you need to stop what you're
doing. You need to tell all the kids
to go back to school, and back to their
normal lives.

CARTMAN
Sister, have you read this book.

SISTER ANNE
Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.


CARTMAN
Then you know what it says happens to
those who don't follow the Lord-uh.


SISTER ANNE
Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody
to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He
wants people to live their llives.


CARTMAN
Are you saying that what the Bible says
isn't true?

SISTER ANNE
No.

CARTMAN
We've got Jews and perverts and bullies
and all kinds of sinners in this town,
Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest
we've decided to save ourselves. The
only ones that kids can trust now are
me and Jesus!

SISTER ANNE
Uugh.  Wait a minute. That's it.


TELEVANGELIST
...And I'm gonna save all of you right
now.  I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.


CARTMAN
Whoa.

[Hell, Bargain Hotel. Chris approaches and goes to Room 16, and
knocks on the door]

SADDAM
Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!

CHRIS
Yeah. It's me.

SADDAM
I thought I killed you!

CHRIS
Yeah,

SADDAM, CHRIS
Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?


SADDAM
Right, right.

CHRIS
Do you have a couple of minutes to go
for a walk?

SADDAM
A walk?

CHRIS
Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park
or somethin'.

SADDAM
Is this some kind of trick?

CHRIS
No, I just want you to go for a quick
walk with me. Please?

SADDAM
Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin'
real quick.  Okay, let's walk.

[Hell, the park. Saddam and Chris walk side by side]

CHRIS
Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't
like me very much.

SADDAM
Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When
I stabbed you in the head?!

CHRIS
Look, Satan is a very important person
to me. And I know he's an important
person to you, too. So don't you think
it's best for us to just- try and get
along? I realize that some things about
me bother you. So I'd like to hear what
those things are so that I can work
on them.

SADDAM
You know what I don't like you, Chris?
Because you're the kind of guy who,
if someone didn't like him, would take
him for a walk in the park and ask him
why. You're a pussy!

CHRIS
Aaaah!  Oh God!

SADDAM
Ah hahaha!

CHRIS
Nooo! Agh!

SADDAM
Aaaaaah!

CHRIS
Ow!  Goo-aagh!

[Cartman's church, next day. The child congregation is gathered
again at the church. Organ music plays]

CARTMAN
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners
are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you
believe in God-uh?!

KYLE
Yes!

CARTMAN
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!


KYLE
Yes!

CARTMAN
That's good, because right now, all
the Jewness is comin' out of your body,
bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!
Theah!

KYLE
Ow!

CARTMAN
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do
you feel the light of God inside o'ya?


KYLE
Uh, I think so.

CARTMAN
Praise the Lord-uh!

CROWD
Praise the Lord. Halleluyah! Praise
God!

CARTMAN
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up
the next person!  This boy has been
crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God
saying that this boy will walk!

BUTTERS
Huh-ah Halleluyah!

TIMMY
Timmiiiy!

CARTMAN
We are gonna save you and you are gonna
walk with the Lord-uh!

TIMMY
Timmiiiy!

CARTMAN
Devil be  GOAN-uh!

TIMMY
Haaaaah.

CARTMAN
Now WALK, Timmih!

TIMMY
Haaaaah.

CARTMAN
Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!


TIMMY
Haah.

CARTMAN
The Lord wants you to walk,Timmih! Oo-WALK,
Timmih!

TIMMY
Timmilih?

CARTMAN
He walks-uh!

KIDS
Whoa!

TIMMY
Oh-aah.

CARTMAN
Yes! Praise the Lord!

KIDS
Praise the Lord!

[Hell, River Styx Condos. Satan is talking to somebody outside]


SATAN
And now it's like there's one guy who's
horrible to me but I'm totally sexually
attracted to, and then one guy who's
really nice to me but I'm not sexually
attracted to at all.

BLONDE GIRL
Wow, that really sucks.

SATAN
I've asked everybody for advice, but
nobody seems to know the answer.

BLONDE GIRL
Well, there is one person who I always
used to ask when I needed advice.


SATAN
Who?

BLONDE GIRL
God.

SATAN
God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken
to God in like, 5000 years.

BLONDE GIRL
Well then, maybe it's time.

[Cartman's church, day. The child congregation is singing and
clapping outside and inside. Timmy is back, with a bandaged head]


KIDS
Do dodo dum do dodo. Do dodo dum do
dodo.

CARTMAN
For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Where
are you from, little boy?

BOY
Denver.

CARTMAN
And God is telling me that you have...
bad eyesight. Is that it?

BOY
Yeah, that's right.

KIDS
Wooooo!

CARTMAN
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes,
and save you from the devil begone!


BOY
Aaah.

KIDS
Hooray!

CARTMAN
For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Right
here we have a little girl who is very,
very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna
cure your face of the uglies?!

UGLY GIRL
Yes!!

CARTMAN
He is gonna take that ugly face and
make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!


UGLY GIRL
Waah.

CARTMAN
Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good
Lord, somebody say "Amen!"

KIDS
Amen!

ALL
Lord Lord Lord.

[A flash of white, and the light dims enough to show clouds roiling
in the sky. Satan comes up quickly, and then stops. This is heaven.
A group of Mormon souls gather around him]

MORMON 1
Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've
followed the Mormon faith, and so you've
been let in!

SATAN
Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.


MORMON 2
Well, you've picked a great time! We've
got cookies and punch and we're just
about to start playing charades.

MORMONS
Alright. Yeah.

MORMON 1
And then, brother Stephen's brought
his guitar so we can sing songs about
how much it hurts to lie.

MORMONS
Ooooo!

MORMON 3
Yeahahah!

SATAN
Ah, look, I just need to talk with God.
Is he around?

MORMON 2
Sure. All you have to do is say his
name and he's there.

MORMON 1
I'm so grateful for that.

MORMONS
Me, too. Uh huh.

SATAN
Great. Thanks.

[Heaven, a separate area. Satan walks into it and turns to the
camera]

SATAN
Ah. Hello? g-God? It's uh... Satan.


GOD
Yea. Look upon me, and know me.

SATAN
Hi, God.

GOD
Hello, Satan.  It's- been a long time.


SATAN
Yeah.

GOD
What brings you here? Do you wish to
mount your unholy war against heaven?


SATAN
No, I hae a problem, and I- need your
advice.

GOD
You want to rule more than hell? You
want to destroy the earth?

SATAN
No, it's kind of a long story but, well,
it all started when this Iraqi dictator,
Saddam Hussein , was killed by a pack
of wild boars. I remember when I first
met him in hell. It was a lovely morning
in April...

[Cartman's church, day. Cartman leads the kids in singing and
rolls on his back a few times.]

CARTMAN
Halleluyah! Praise the Lord! And now,
I'm receiving a message directly from
God-uh! God is telling me that... each
and every one of you is to walk up to
the stage, and give me one dollar!
So I want everyone to feel the love
of God by coming up heah , and putting
a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't
be shy! Come on now!

STAN
Dude, that seems- kind of- weird.

KYLE
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything
about this.

[Heaven, a separate area. Satan finishes his story]

SATAN
Heh-and now Chris and Saddam just keep
killing each other over and over and...
I don't know which one to pick.

GOD
Jesus, what the hell happened to you?


SATAN
Huh?

GOD
You got kicked out of here for being
a headstrong rebel. And now you're a
whiny little bitch.

SATAN
Well, I just don't know which one to
pick.

GOD
No, you've become dependent on relationships.
So you haven't even considered the option
of not being with either of them.  And
if you're not sexually attracted to
someone, you're not ever going to be.
But Saddam isn't right either. He's
the other extreme. You need to spend
time alone so that you can find the
balance, the middle ground. That's what
I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.


SATAN
God, you're right. You know, I've had
steady relationships for the last... thousand
years, and when one ends I just start
another one, but... I haven't taken the
time to be secure with myself.

GOD
Bingo.

SATAN
Hey- Thanks, God. I forgot how clear
you make things sometimes.

GOD
It was nice to see you again, Satan.


SATAN
You too.

GOD
Good-bye.

MORMON 2
Would you like to stay for some cookies
and punch?

MORMON 1
Yes, would you?

SATAN
Uh, no, I need to be getting back.


MORMON 2
Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss
our big play.

MORMON 4
Yes. We're going to do a play about
how alcohol can ruin family life.


SATAN
Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really-
gotta go.

MORMON 1
Wehull, he seemed like a nice fellow.


MORMON 4
Yes.

MORMON 2
Let's go make things out of egg cartons.


MORMONS
Oooo, yeah. I'll do that.

[Cartman's church, day. The singing and clapping have resumed.
Stan and Kyle go through some curtains to the back of the church.]


CARTMAN
Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys,
it actually worked!

STAN
What worked?

CARTMAN
Eheverybody bought the whole act! They
keep giving and giving until we have
it all!

STAN, KYLE
What??

KYLE
You're keeping that money yourself?


CARTMAN
Of course, you guys! And then we can
make... ten million dollars!  Look, the
tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy
band thing didn't last, so I tried this
route.

STAN
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. You mean that
this whole thing has just been a way
for you to make ten million dollars?


CARTMAN
It all came to me days ago, when we
were first in Sunday school.

STAN
Well, what about going to hell and
all that?!

CARTMAN
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he
wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister
Anne told me that.

KYLE
Then why didn't you tell us?!

CARTMAN
My brain is of a much larger size than
you guys's. I couldn't expect you to
understand, not until you actually saw
the cash flow!

KYLE
The only thing of yours that's larger
in size is your big fat ass!

CARTMAN
Suck my balls!

STAN
Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.


[Somewhere in hell. Chris and Saddam are fighting once again.
Saddam charges at him with a gray brick]

SADDAM
Die, pussy!

CHRIS
Ow!

SADDAM
Aaaah!

CHRIS
Aaaah!

SATAN
Guys, guys, guys!  Look, you both can
stop fighting now! I've made a decision.


CHRIS
You have?

SATAN
Yes. I... don't want to be with either
one of you.

CHRIS, SADDAM
What?!

SATAN
Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll
never be the friend that I want. And
Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll
never be the lover I want.  So I'm just
gonna be alone for a while and learn
to like myself.

CHRIS
Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?


SATAN
No, I'm not going on a walk! You're
a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy;
go away!

CHRIS
Fine.

SADDAM
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't
let you!

[Cartman's church, next day. Cartman holds forth. Stan and Kyle
stand behind the collection box as kids stop by and put in their
$1 donations]

CARTMAN
Today is another day! And that's another
dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So
come on up and give to the Lord-uh!


SISTER ANNE
Alright kids, it's time to go! It's
time for this to stop!

CARTMAN
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!

SISTER ANNE
I know you won't listen to me. That's
why I brought somebody else.

KIDS
Wow!

BUTTERS
Jesus!

CARTMAN
Uh oh.

JESUS
Kids, you need to all stop spending
all your time here and go back to school.


CARTMAN
Jesus, ixnay on the oolschay.

JESUS
God doesn't want you to spend all your
time being afraid of hell, or praising
His name. God wants you to spend your
time helping others, and living a good,
happy life. That's how you live for
Him.

CARTMAN
Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting
a dollar in the box-uh!

BEBE
Let's go ice-skating.

OTHER KIDS
Yea.

BUTTERS
Uhwe can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate,
too.

BOY
Yeah.

CARTMAN
No, come back! You face everlasting
damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be
cheated out of my ten million dollars
again! God damnit!

KYLE
Serves you right, Cartman!

STAN
Yeah!

JESUS
But Eric, I think this time I have to
teach you a lesson! I'm sending you
somewhere to think about your sins!


CARTMAN
You're gonna send me to hell?

JESUS
No. Worse!

[Ensenada, Mexico, day. Mariachi music plays in the baackground.
A tour bus stops in front of Papas and Beer and drops Cartman
off, then pulls away.]

KENNY
(Eric! Eric!)

CARTMAN
Aw, crap!

[Hell, the park. Satan is strolling through the park in a happy
mood]

SATAN
Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.

RICK
Hi, Satan.

SADDAM
There you are!

SATAN
Awgh. Not again.

SADDAM
You know you can't live without me.
Now GET THAT ASS BACK TO BED!

SATAN
Saddam, I told you: I don't need you
anymore!

SADDAM
You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves
me.

SATAN
Yes I can! Raaarrr

SADDAM
Aw, you little -prick!

SATAN
Good-bye forever, Saddam!

SADDAM
What are you talking about?! You can
kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.


SATAN
Not this time! I asked a favor of an
old friend of mine to let you in!


SADDAM
Let me in where?

[Heaven, Saddam is whisked into it, as Satan was]

SADDAM
What the? Hey, what the hell is this
place?!

MORMON 5
Hello, and welcome.

MORMON 1
We're glad you made it, brother.

SADDAM
Ey, who the hell are you?

MORMON 6
We're just about to do a play, about
how much stealing hurts you deep inside.
Come join us.

MORMONS
Yes. Come on. Let's go.

MORMON 6
You're here forever.

SADDAM
Nooo! Nu- nooooooooooo!

"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 412


"TRAPPER KEEPER"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, the bus stup, day. Stan and Kenny wait at the bus
stop. Kyle and Ike walk up. Ike is dressed in a little business
suit and his hair is combed]

STAN
Dude! What's your little brother doing
here?

KYLE
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten


STAN
But isn't he only three years old?


KYLE
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius,
so he's getting advanced placement in
kindergarten.

IKE
Ah poobed my pants.

KYLE
But dude, check out my new Trapper
Keeper!  It has five different compartments
for each subject in school.  And it's
all covered with pictures from Dawson's
Creek.

STAN
Cool!

CARTMAN
Hey, dudes, check out my sweet Dawson's
Creek Trapper Keeper Ultrakeeper Futura
2000!  Yeah, well , it's got ten different
compartments for every subject in school,
an electronic pencil sharpener, four
plastic bags with electronic zippers,
copy machine, fax, a better picture
of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's,
flat-screen TV, and of course, On-Star.


STAN
Wow, cool!

KYLE
God-damnit, you only got that because
you knew my mom would buy it for me!


CARTMAN
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepeh- Oh,
you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't
you? Well, at least your stupid brother
got a briefcase.

KYLE
He's going to kindergarten because he's
a genius!

CARTMAN
He's not a genius, he's a little douche
bag.

IKE
Ah pooped my pants!!!

KYLE
He's smarter than you, fatboy!! I don't
even know how you made it into fourth
grade! I thought-

CARTMAN
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out
my annoying friend. Please initiate
music, country, high volume.

KYLE
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper
Keeper, Cartman!

[The bus, day. The boys take their seats. Cartman and Kenny sit
behind Kyle, Stan, and Ike. All of them notice the disheveled
man on the other side of the bus]

STAN
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy
homeless guy on the bus.

MS. CRABTREE
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!

STAN
But they smell like pee.

ANDROID
I am not a homeless personne. I am a
new fourth-grade studant.

KYLE
You are?

ANDROID
Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.

STAN
Aren't you a little old to be in grade
school?

BILL
I was held back ten humon grades.  I
mean, grades. Do you companion-friends
know Eric Cartman?

CARTMAN
Yeah, that's me.

BILL
Eric Cartman?! And you have a Dawson's
Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S2000


CARTMAN
Yeahhh, you already know about it??


BILL
Yes. Yes I do.

CARTMAN
Well! "Nobody gives a crap about your
Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"

KYLE
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!


STAN
Dude, do you really care if Cartman
has something that's better than yours?


KYLE
No I don't! I don't care!

CARTMAN
Here, Kyle.

[South Park Elementary, kindergarten room. The room appears festive,
the wall adorned with a beaming sun with rays coming from it,
rolling hills with trees here and there. The kids enter and take
their places at the round table. Two miffed boys stand by the
door as Ike enters the room]

BOY #1
Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's
s'posed to be some kind of genius.


BOY #2
Yeah, he's only three and he's already
in kindergarten.

BOY #1
Come on.  So, you think you're smarter
than the rest of us? Do you think you
know more about the world just because
you are only 3 and we're 5?

IKE
Unkoo baba.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, let's take our seats.
My name is Mr. Garrison. And I'm the
new kindergarten teacher. I used to
be the third grade teacher, but I had
a little  "nervous breakdown" and went
into the mountains where I lived off
of  "rat carcasses"  But I'm all better
now, and the school was nice enough
to let me g n teaching, as long as it
was for kindergarten.  But it's not
a demotion. No. I mean, just because
a teacher was teaching third grade and
now is teaching kindergarten, that's
not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right,
it's not. Well, let's start with role
call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?


FILMORE
Heoh.

MR. GARRISON
Sally Bands?

SALLY
Here.

MR. GARRISON
Alright, Ike Broflovski.

IKE
Cookah Monster.

MR. GARRISON
Broflovski --- I had your older brother
Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a
very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.
Well that's bad news for everybody
else, because I will be grading you
all on a curve.

[South Park Elementary, fourth grade room. The class is present,
along with "Bill Cosby" Cartman elaboraes on the wonderful attributes
of his Trapper Keeper]

CARTMAN
And so the other thing that makes my
Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is
that it can add any peripheral device
to itself automatically.  I can take
something as simple as this calculator
and... Trapper Keeper?

TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper active.

CARTMAN
Hybrid with Wellington Bear Calculator.


TRAPPER KEEPER
Ready for hybrid.

CARTMAN
And now it can use Wellington Bear Calculator,
too.

KIDS
Wow.

BILL
May I hold your Trapper Keeper?

CARTMAN
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby,
because it is coded to the prints on
my fingers.  If anybody but me tries
to hold it, big metal spikes come out
and pierce through their hands.

KYLE
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman!
Metal spikes will not come out!

CARTMAN
Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold
it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't
have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold
it.

KYLE
I'm gonna!

CARTMAN
Hold it.

KYLE
I will!

[South Park Elementary, kindergarten room. Mr. Garrison is telling
his life story to the kids]

MR. GARRISON
Aaand that's how the relationship with
my father sort of ended. There's still
some sort of skeletons in the closet,
but things between us are a little better.
Okay, children, well now it's time
for us to elect a class president ,
so first we must pick nominees.  Who
would like to nominate someone?

BOY #2
I nominate Filmore, because he's the
smartest kid in the class.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first
nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.


JENNY
I gotta go doodie.

MR. GARRISON
In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to
nominate a class presdient?  Oh, come
on! You can't have an election with
just one person running! What's the
fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're
a genius.

IKE
No.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, our second nominee is Ike The
Genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear
briefly from each nominee. Filmore,
why don't you go first?

FILMORE
If I'm elected class president, I'll
call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays,
I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank
you.

MR. GARRISON
Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about
you?

IKE
Cookeh Monsta. Oight

MR. GARRISON
...Well, this is gonna be a tough one,
kids.

[South Park Elementary playground. The four boys stand around
the tetherball pole while two kids in front of them toss a football,
two girls walk by behind them, another kid climbs the jungle
gym, and another rocks on a hobby elephant]

STAN
Oh, dude, here comes that weird new
kid.

BILL
Aaahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your humon
friend?  I mean, friend?

CARTMAN
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed
to have any male friends that are over
30. I kind of screwed on that once.


BILL
Please. We can have fun and play games,
like humon four square  I mean, four
square.

CARTMAN
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's
friend and be their friend, It doesn't
work that way. If you want to be my
friend, you'll have to pay me.

Bill	Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones --- uh, I
mean, human dollars! --- eugh, I mean dollars!

CARTMAN
Okay, that's cool.

Bill	[holds up the tetherball] Can we play some humon tetherball?


CARTMAN
Ah- alright. Pretty sweet, you guys,
getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball
with some- .

Bill	Serve! [whips the ball at Cartman, knocking him onto his
back. The Trapper Keeper falls away and lands next to Kenny.
"Bill" makes his move]

CARTMAN
Ugh.

Bill	Got it!

CARTMAN
Ey!

STAN
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper
Keeper!

BILL
Waa-aaaah!

CARTMAN
You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.
Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper
homing device.

STAN
What the hell just happened?

KYLE
Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna
be different.

[South Park Elementary, Kindergarten. Mr. Garrison tallies up
the votes so far on the board...]

MR. GARRISON
So that's six votes for Filmore and
six votes for Ike.  And the last vote
is for... uh, let's see. Flora, I can't
tell who you voted for.  You've got
the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?


FLORA
I don't know...

MR. GARRISON
Flora, you have to pick one: Filmore
or Ike.

FLORA
Um, I vote for... I don't know.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well,
you're just gonna have to sit there,
Flora, and think about it until you
come up with an answer.

FLORA
Okay.

Boy #2	Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go
home.

FLORA
Um...

SALLY
No! You want Ike to be president.

FILMORE
We're gonna be here all night! Why don't
you guys just concede?!

TWO KIDS
Yeah!

SALLY
Why don't you just concede?!

OTHER KIDS
Yeah!

SOME KIDS
Filmore!

OTHER KIDS
Ike!

A GIRL
I want Ike to be president!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting
like a bunch o' kids!

[South Park, day. A police car zooms down the street. Officer
Barbrady flies down the road in the police cruiser with Cartman
in the passenger seat and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny in the back seat.
Cartman has the Trapper Tracker Keeper in his hand and is following
the Trapper Keeper's signal on the Tracker's screen]

CARTMAN
Turn left here! We're getting close!
Get your gun ready!

BARBRADY
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for
taking your school folder!

CARTMAN
It was NOT a school folder, it was
a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura
S2000! And if-!  There he is!

BILL
Wah!

CARTMAN
Got ya!

BARBRADY
Hey!

BILL
Gaaaah!

KYLE
Whoa, dude!

CARTMAN
Aah, try to take my Trapper Keeper,
will you?

BILL
Please. You do not understand.

CARTMAN
Book him, Barbrady. Another job well
done.

BILL
That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!


STAN
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's
Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?

BARBRADY
Bill Cosby??

BILL
Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really
Bill Cosby.  My name is VSM471. I am
a cyborg engineered by humons from the
year 2034.

BARBRADY
Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!


VSM471
I have come to destroy that Trapper
Keeper, because it was the Dawson's
Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to
an Eric Cartman in South Park which
three years from now manifests itself
into an omnipotent superbeing, and destroys
all of humonity. In the year two thousand
and four a hybrid-assimilating computer
linked with a satellite uplink computer.
From there it was able to slowly take
over every computer in the world.  It
became stronger and stronger! Until,
by the year 2018 it broke away from
mankind  and there was nothing the humons
could do.  It wasn't long before Mighty
Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything
as useless, including humons.  The nations
tried everything to stop it.  Nuclear
devices, seismic missiles. But nothng
worked.  The humons built robots of
their own, whole armies of them  But
nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper
Keeper.  And so finally, the humons
decided to send one of their robots
into the past to destroy the Trapper
Keeper before it even got started.


STAN
Wow, that's amazing

KYLE
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology
and stuff grow too fast.

STAN
What do you think, Officer Barbrady?


BARBRADY
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.


VSM471
And so, Eric. Now you see why we must
destroooyy your Trapper Keeper.

CARTMAN
...You guys. Did I mention that it has
a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?


STAN
Cartman, it takes over the world and
destroy all of humanity!

CARTMAN
What would you guys have me do, huh?!
Walk around with just a plain old Trapper
Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you
want?!

STAN
Yes!

CARTMAN
Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want
my heart as well?! You'll find it on
the bottom of your shoes!

[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The class is looking at
Flora. Mr. Mackey sits on a chair looking bored]

FLORA
I decided.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who
do you vote for?

FLORA
Uumm, Ike.

IKE'S SUPPORTERS
YAY!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, so then the total is six for
Filmore and now seven votes for Ike.
Ike is the new class persident.

FILMORE
We want a recount.

MR. GARRISON
What?

FILMORE'S SUPPORTERS
Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!


MR. GARRISON
Oh, of all the juvenile things I've
ever heard! You LOST, Filmore! Don't
be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll
count up the ballots again. Okay, we
had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this
time, I again get six votes for Filmore
and seven votes for Ike!

FILMORE
Count them again.

FILMORE'S SUPPORTERS
Yeh!

MR. GARRISON
NO, children! I've recounted 106 times
now and I keep coming up with seven
to six! Except in the one instance where
it came out seven to five, and one where
it came out twelve to fourteen. IT'S
OVER! IKE IS CLASS PRESIDENT!

KID #2
Wait, there's still that absent kid.


FILLMORE
Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to
wait for his vote.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, will you grow up?!

FILMORE'S SUPPORTERS
Absent kids count! Absent kids count!


MR. GARRISON
Jesus! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow
so the absent kid can cast his vote!
Now go home!

[South Park Elementary, hallway, next day.]

VSM471
Good morning, humons.

STAN, KYLE
Hey, Bill Cosby.

VSM471
I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's
Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped
the motherboards in acid, burned the
memory chips, and sent the wiring to
the four corners of Canada.

KYLE
That should do it.

STAN
So what are you going to do with your
crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?


VSM471
Well, that is a problem that is causing
me some disconcernment. I am still here,
but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper
Keeper has been stopped, then I should
not exist. But here I am. Something
is still not right.

CARTMAN
Hey, dudes.

STAN
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!


CARTMAN
Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went
home and told my mom that I lost the
last one. Then I cried and I cried,
and finally she felt so bad that she
took me to the store and bought me a
NEW one!  So everything worked out.


VSM471
Oh no!

KYLE
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get
a new one!

CARTMAN
Why the hell not?!

STAN
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes
over the world, then maybe it was THIS
Trapper Keeper and not the one before!


CARTMAN
Wait... sso then you guys burned my last
one for no reason!

VSM471
We will have to destroy this Trapper
Keeper.

CARTMAN
But I don't think I can get my mom
to buy me another one.

KYLE
Don't you get it?! You can't have ANY
Trapper Keeper, fatass!

CARTMAN
Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what
I think?! I think this whole thing is
a SETUP! That's right! Kyle got this
guy to say that he's a robot from the
future just because he's jealous of
my Trapper Keeper! And you know what
else?! Screw you guys, I'm going home!


STAN
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Ech! Screw you guys, home!

VSM471
Well, that does it!

KYLE
Hey! What are you doing?

VSM471
I'm afraid I have no other choice!
For the sake of humanity I have to kill
him.

KYLE
Oh. Okay.

STAN
Yeah, that's fine...  No, wait!

VSM471
What?!

STAN
Can I do it?

VSM471
Oh, well, I suppose...

STAN
Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fatboy!


VSM471
Wait!  Perhaps there is another way.
If you could take me to where Eric Cartman
lives, I could try reasoning with his
human mother.

STAN
Whoa. Yeah, or we could just kill him.


KYLE
Yeah, that'd be faster.

STAN
He's right there.

VSM471
I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually
starting to feel what you humons call
"compassion." It is an amazing feeling!


STAN, KYLE
AWWW!

[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. Mr. Garrison stands before
the class and begins to speak]

MR. GARRISON
Alright children, as you know, we've
been waiting for the absent kid's ballot
to come in. Well, his mother was nice
enough to bring him in from the hospital
so that he could cast his vote. Ms.
Harris?

BOY
Here.

MR. GARRISON
Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget
to pick up your lung.  Alright, the
absent kid's ballot is for...  Fillmore.


FILMORE'S SUPPORTERS
Yay, hooray.

SALLY
Wait one minute!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, Jesus Tapdancing Christ!

SALLY
I think the ballot were misleading.
Some kids didn't understand whom they
were voting for.

MR. GARRISON
There's a box next to Filmore's name
and a box next to Ike's! What's not
to understand?!

FILMORE
You're just saying that, 'cause you
know you're gonna lose now!

SALLY
No, I'm saying that because you are
a boogerface!

FILMORE
Well, just you wait, 'cause myuh famous
aunt is on huh way wight now.

MR. GARRISON
Who's your famous aunt?

FILMORE
My aunt Wosie, Wosie O'Donnell

MR. GARRISON
Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming
here?

FILMORE
Yeah, she's vewy active in politics.
So she's gonna set all this straight.


MR. GARRISON
Oh no!

[The Cartman house, day, Cartman's room. Cartman sets the Trapper
Keeper in a tray, then secures it onto a docking bay and plugs
a cable into it.]

TRAPPER KEEPER
Recharging.

CARTMAN
Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper.
I would never let those assholes take
you away.

I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper forever

The ways of my Trap-

TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.

CARTMAN
Oh! Cool.

TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, merging.

CARTMAN
Whoa.

[The Cartman house, day, dining room. "Bill" is seated at the
head of the table, with Ms. Cartman and Kenny to his right, and
Stan and Kyle to his left.]

VSM471
And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot
buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper.
Not now! Not ever!

MS. CARTMAN
Right, because it will hybrid with all
those other processors and generate
a whole new era of technological darkness.


VSM471
Correct.

MS. CARTMAN
Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore,
then... Bill

VSM471
Good. Now all that is left to do is
destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has
now. Where is he?

MS. CARTMAN
In his room. But, why don't I show you
the rest of the house first?

STAN
Uh oh.

KYLE
Here we go again.

MS. CARTMAN
Come this way, Billy.

STAN
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and
get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves.


[The Cartman house, day, Cartman's room. Cartman is getting friendly
with his Trapper Keeper]

CARTMAN
...Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper
Keeper. You kick ass! I don't wanna
let my Trapper Keeper get-

STAN
Open up, Cartman! We're taking your
Trapper Keeper!

CARTMAN
Screw you guys, screw you guys. Screw
you guys, scr-

TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.

CARTMAN
Huh?

KYLE
Damnit Cartman, open up!

TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.

CARTMAN
Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with
now?

STAN
Cartman, you might as well open up!
We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust
the door down after he finishes having
sex with your mom!

KYLE
Cartman??  He's not gonna open it! Break
it down!

STAN
You break it down!

KYLE
Okay. Ready? One Two Three, Not it!


STAN
Not it! You lose, Kenny.

KENNY
(Damn!)  (Hah!)

STAN
...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

KYLE
You ba-

[The Cartman house, day, outside. The front door opens and Stan
and Kyle rush outside and away.]

STAN, KYLE
AAAAAHHHH!!!!

TRAPPER KEEPER
Trapper Keeper.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. Mr. Garrison sits with
the class around the table and hears some ominous noise]

MR. GARRISON
What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What
is that thing?! Children, there's some
huge bulbous monstrosity heading for
the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful!
It's coming for the door.

ROSIE O'DONNELL
Hello, kids!

FILMORE
Aunt Wosie!

MR. GARRISON
Run for your lives, children!  I'll
try to fight it off!

FILMORE
That's my aunt, Wosie O'Donnell.

MR. GARRISON
Oh. Oh, um. Pleasure to meet you, Miss
O'Donnell. You're looking... well.

ROSIE O'DONNELL
Don't worry kids. Everythng's gonna
be fine. What's the problem?

FILMORE
Aunt Wosie. We think I won for class
president.

IKE SUPPORTER
No, Ike won.

MR. GARRISON
Look, it's very simple. We took a vote
and the vote tied, so now we gotta come
up with a way-

ROSIE O'DONNELL
Well it obviously isn't that simple,
is it?! I mean, you'd think a little
kindergarten teacher could've handled
this, but now we're gonna do it my way!



Colorado Springs	20mi

Pueblo	75mi

Cheyenne Mountain

Secret Military Base	18mi

[South Park, outskirts. The Trapper Keeper enters the scene and
demolishes the sign]

TRAPPER KEEPER
We are Trapper Keeper.

VSM471
Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!


KYLE
Why is that bad?

VSM471
It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated
with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain
that it was able to fuse into all defensive
computors!

STAN
Then we have to stop it before it gets
there!

KYLE
Step on it, Bill Cosby!

[The road to Cheyenne Mountain. All is quiet. Two security guards
wait at the entrance reading newspapers. The one wearing glasses
looks up]

GUARD 2
Hey Mark, look.

MARK
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper
Keeper I've ever seen.

STAN
Cartman, you have to stop!

TRAPPER KEEPER
We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.


VSM471
A part of your friend must still be
alive in there.

STAN
He is in there.

VSM471
That must be what Trapper Keeper is
using for ventilation. If one of you
could get in there, you could reach
the CPU

STAN
One-two-three not it!

KYLE
Not- Aw, Damnit!

[The Trapper Keeper Interior. Kyle makes his way in and scrambles
through a field of organs until he reaches another entrance.
The valves open up and suck Kyle into a room bathed in light.
Kyle floats in.]

CARTMAN
What are you doing, Kyle?

KYLE
I'm going to try and break you away
from the computer, Cartman. I need to
remove the CPU.

CARTMAN
I'm afraid I can't let you do that,
Kyle.

KYLE
Screw you, fatass!

CARTMAN
Hey-eh, screw you.

KYLE
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Ahh!

KYLE
No!


AS LONG AS

IT TAKES	GIVE UP	Filmore

rules!	We like

IKE!

ROSIE O'DONNELL
Okay, so then what we're going to do
is count everybody's vote by hand, and
after that, we're gonna go over the
votes again manually, and then-

MR. GARRISON
Oh, STOP IT, STOP STOP IHIHIHIHIT!
Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten
class together. We have to respect one
another or else we're in for a terrible
school year.

ROSIE O'DONNELL
We're just making sure that the kids
that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.


MR. GARRISON
Half the kids in the class didn't vote
for your nephew, so what about them?
You don't give a crap about them because
they're not on your side! People like
you preach tolerance and open-mindedness
all the time, but when it comes to Middle
America, you think we're all evil and
stupid country yokels who need your
political enlightenment!! WELL, JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TV DOESN'T MEAN YOU
KNOW CRAP ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT!!! NOW
GET YOUR ASS BACK ON FIRST CLASS AND
RESPECT THIS CLASS'S RIGHT TO MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MINDS!!!  ...Oh, sorry I got
a little off the subject, kids.

ROSIE O'DONNELL
How dare you?! I will not be preached
at by a country bumpkin!  I'm leaving
this podunk town, but in my place I'm
gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and
press than you have ever SEEN!

MR. GARRISON
Oh no, children, I think I've just made
this a whole lot worse.

[South Park, a red sunset. At Cheyenne Mountain the Trapper Keeper
has spread itself over it and taken it over. A slimy appendage
reaches out and grabs a phone both next to two ladies]

LADIES
Aaahh!

COPS
Waaah!

MARK
Well that does it! I'm gonna have to
report this!  Cargo on to base-  AAGH!


VSM471
It is infusing with everything. It is
already too powerful to stop!

STAN
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got
to.

[The Trapper Keeper Interior. Kyle struggles to make his way
out of the little prison he's in]

KYLE
I can't reach the CPU.

[Cheyenne Mountain, outside. A limo speeds up to the scene and
encounters the Trapper Keeper, which is beginning to look like
the tower in "Bill"'s prophecy. Rosie O'Donnell pops out and
walks up to it.]

ROSIE
What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!


GUARD 2
Oh no! Now there's two of those things!


STAN
No, I think that other thing is Rosie
O'Donnell.

GUARD 2
Huh? Which one? I- It's just like I'm
seeing double.

ROSIE
I said, get out of my way!  AAAaaAAaaaagh!
Ogh. Noo-

TRAPPER KEEPER
Eeww.

VSM471
Look! I think that infusing with Rosie
O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.


TRAPPER KEEPER
Oohh. Bad pie. Bad pie.

STAN
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has
weakened!

[The Trapper Keeper Interior. Cartman releases his hold on Kyle
and Kyle drops to the floor. He quickly moves to the wall panel
containing the CPU and pulls the CPU out along with some memory
chips]

KYLE
Got 'em!

[Cheyenne Mountain, outside. Trapper Keeper turns into a big
mass of goo, and the people trapped in it are spat out. Rosie
ends up half-eaten. Everybody begins to approach the survivors]


STAN
He did it!

[South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The kids are seated around
the round table, and their lawyers stand behind them arguing.
Mr. Garrison sits at the head of the table listening]

MR. GARRISON
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's
side have agreed with the lawyers on
Filmore's side to hold another meeting
regardng Form 22F. Do we all have that
form?

JESSE JACKSON
Is this the Kindergarten classroom?


MR. GARRISON
Jesse Jackson?

JESSE JACKSON
That's right! I believe the African-American
in your class were misrepresented!


MR. GARRISON
We don't have any African-Americans
in our class!

JESSE JACKSON
Oh. Bye.

MR. GARRISON
Alright, so apparently what we're gonna
do now is hand-count each person's ballot-


FILMORE
Mistoreh Garrison, I concede.

MR. GARRISON
You... yuh, you what?

FILMORE
I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this
game is stupid!

SALLY
Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.

FILMORE
Ike, you could be class president.


IKE
I pooped my pants!

SALLY
Can we fingerpaint now?

KIDS
Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!

MR. GARRISON
Ohuh. Yes.  Yes! Let's fingerpaint!


[Cheyenne Mountain, aftermath. Stan and the others reach Cartman
and Kyle]

STAN
You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life,
fatass!

VSM471
Goodbye, humons.  Oh, ogh! Oh, it hurts!


STAN
Oh, that's a bitch.

CARTMAN
Ogh. Well, I guess everything's fine
now. So let's go home.

STAN
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've
been doing is making fun of Kyle and
now he's saved your life! You at least
owe him a thank you!

CARTMAN
Awww man.

STAN
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Alright, alright.  Kyle, -

"A LADDER TO HEAVEN"


Written by


Trey Parker





LOLLY
Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's
Candy Shop.

STAN
We're the kids whose names you called
on your commercial last night. We're
here to do the shopping spree!

LOLLY
Oh that's great!

CARTMAN
You bet your fat clown ass it is!

LOLLY
Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket
stub.

CARTMAN
...ticket stub?

LOLLY
Well you know. When you entered the
contest you got the other half of this
ticket.

STAN
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub??


KYLE
It was such a long time ago!

CARTMAN
Wu-we don't "really" need the ticket
stub, do we?

LOLLY
Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you
high?? How else do I know you're the
winners?

STAN
Because our names were called on the
commercial last night!

LOLLY
Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy
shopping spree. If you find it, you
can come back, but you only have one
week to claim the prize. That's called
"The Ticking Clock." Works great in
the movies.

CARTMAN
GODDAMNIT!!!

STAN
We're gotta find that ticket!

KYLE
Which one of us took it?! It was so
long ago, I c- I can't remember.

CARTMAN
You guys we've got to focus! We've got
to focus, and remember.

[Lolly's Candy Factory, over a year ago. Kenny is still alive
back then.]

LOLLY
All right. There you go. Hold on to
that ticket stub. You'll need it to
claim your prize.  Shign up for the
five-minute shopping spree!!

STAN
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might
lose it.

CARTMAN
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep
track of it, Kyle.

KYLE
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much
responsibility. Here, you hold on to
it, Kenny.

KENNY
(Okay.)

[back to the present. The boys realize Kenny was the last to
hold the stub as their mouths open.]

CARTMAN
Kenny!!!

STAN, KYLE
AAAHHH!!

[Kenny's house, later. The boys arrive gasping for air and Kyle
rings the doorbell.]

STUART
Yes?

STAN
Where's Kenny??

STUART
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December.
Don't you remember?

KYLE
We know he's dead. We mean, where is
his body??

KENNY'S MOM
His body? Well, why??

CARTMAN
Because he has the God-damned ticket
for the-!

STAN
Uh, look. We just really miss our friend
and, ah, andand we need to see his remains
for closure.

KYLE
Yeah. Closure.

CARTMAN
What the fuck is closure?!

KENNY'S MOM
Oh all right boys. Come on in.

[Kenny's house, inside. The boys follow the parents through the
house]

STUART
We haven't seen you boys for so long,
we thought you'd forgotten all about
him.

KENNY'S MOM
Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny.


CARTMAN
You turned him into a teapot?

STUART
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside
it.

KENNY'S MOM
Your friends are here to see you, Kenny.
They miss you an awful lot, like we
all do.

STUART
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih,
it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey.


[Kenny's house, nighttime, living room. A circle appears on a
window and that piece of window is removed. Cartman sets the
circle down and looks around. He reaches up to open the window
latch, then opens the window door. He slips in and goes for the
urn. He pulls out a fake detector and moves it around]

CARTMAN
Wewewewewewe...

STAN
Did you get it?

CARTMAN
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.
Wewewewewewe...

KYLE
There's not gonna be any robot guards,
retard! Just get Kenny!

ROBOT GUARD
Wewewewewewe...

[Cartman's house, night, kitchen. The boys rush to the counter
and climb up on the stools]

KYLE
Alright, we made it!

STAN
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub
with him in there!

KYLE
Let him out, Cartman!

CARTMAN
...Kenny?  Kenny?!

KYLE
Is he in there?

STAN
I can't see.

CARTMAN
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk
mix?!

KYLE
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea
pot!

STAN
It wa a trick!

CARTMAN
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate
milk mix!

STAN
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty
hard about now! We're dumb enough to
believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!


KYLE
Why would they play such a cruel joke
on us?

CARTMAN
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor
people don't have anything better to
do than piss other people off! Don't
you watch Springer?!

STAN
We just have to face it. We're not gonna
get Kenny back and we're not goona have
our shopping spree. It's over!

KYLE
God-damnit! There has to be a way!


CARTMAN
Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad.

[Cartman's room, night. The empty glass sits on his nightstand.
The camera zooms out to show Cartman sleeping with Clyde Frog.
Cartman tosses in his bed and his dream appears. A circle appears.
Outisde of the circle is a lining to a jacket. Inside is someone's
point of view. The surroundings seen in that circle indicates
that this is Kenny's point of view. Kenny seems to be walking
around in his own room. Kenny's arm appears and opens the door,
and Kenny's mom appears at the end of the hall.]

KENNY'S MOM
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late
for school!

CARTMAN
Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate
milk mix agreed with my stomach.


STAN
Cartman, come on!

CARTMAN
What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It's
six in the morning!

STAN
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning
ticket stub back from Kenny!

CARTMAN
How?

KYLE
A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb
up, and get our winning ticket back
from that asshole Kenny.

[Stan's house, day. The blueprints are in place on an easel.
The design is a slender tower rising some 120 feet into the sky.
The camera pulls back to show the boys hammering boards into
place. Stan's parents step outside to see the construction.]


RANDY
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse
you should start with the floor.

STAN
We're not building a clubhouse, we're
building a ladder to heaven.

RANDY
A ladder to heaven? Why, son?

STAN
Because we wanna see Kenny again.


SHARON
Oh... oh, that's so sweet.

RANDY
That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've
ever heard.

JIMBO
Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh...
What the hell are they doing?

RANDY
The boys wanna see their dead friend
Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building
a ladder to heaven.

JIMBO
Awwww.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes
enough.

RANDY
No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys
were just... building a ladder to heaven
to see their old friend, Kenny.

JIMBO
A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, that's so touching.

[Behind Stan's house, day. A reporter has arrived and now begins
his report]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado,
where last December, eight-year-old
Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness.
But now, that little boy's three closest
friends miss their friend so much that
they are building a ladder to heaven,
in order to-  a ladder to heaven in
order to try to see him again.  It's
so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's
what some people had to say.

RANDY MARSH
Well, our son just said to us that he
really needed to see his little friend
Kenny again and... and that he thought
it would work...  if he... built the
ladder to heaven.

KYLE'S MOTHER
They just believe in their little hearts
that it will work. We can't tell them
it won't, we just can't!

JIMBO
It shows how beautiful the innocence
of a child really is.

MR. GARRISON
A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.


MAYOR MCDANIELS
These boys symbolize how we all feel
about loss. Who are we to tell them
it's impossible?

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, people from all over the-  Sorry.
People from all over the country are
coming to see the ladder, feeling a
connection to its symbolism, and beauty.
Even country singer Alan Jackson has
shown up with a song he has written
about the ladder.  Alan Jackson is,
of course, the man who wrote the song,
"Where Were You When the World Stopped
Turning," about the tragedies on September
11. And now he's here once again to
capitalize on people's emotions. Let's
listen in.

ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they built the ladder
to heaven?

Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind
of gay?

TOWNSMAN
What a beautiful song.

ALAN JACKSON
Well I, for one, believe in the ladder
to heaven.

Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11 [the townsfolk begin to cry]

I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___

Eleven. [the song ends]

Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale
right here! [the crowd rushes in to get copies of the CD. Jackson
is pleased at the interest. The boys resume their construction.
Stan and Kyle are hammering away at the top of the ladder. Cartman
hustles up the ladder with a car seat]

KYLE
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.


CARTMAN
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's
car.

STAN
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?

CARTMAN
...No.  Ey! Euuugh.

[Flashback #2 - resumes where the first one left off. Kenny seems
to be walking around in his own room. Kenny's arm appears and
opens the door, and Kenny's mom appears at the end of the hall.]


KENNY'S MOM
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late
for school!

STUART
Kenny, do you by any chance know what
happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer
me!!

KYLE
Cartman? Cartman?!

CARTMAN
Wha-uh, what?? What?

KYLE
Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!


CARTMAN
I don't know. It's like my brain just
keeps... jacking off.

KYLE
Maybe you got brain cancer.

CARTMAN
Do you think?

STAN
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman!
You're gonna fall off and break it!


[SNN newscast. Graphics are shown indicating 74% of Americans
believe in the ladder]

SNN REPORTER
The nation is rallying behind three
sweet boys in Colorado who are building
a ladder to heaven to be with their
dead friend.  It's making Americans
start to believe in heaven, again.


WOMAN 1
Well when I see how this ladder has
brought people together, how... how
it has changed America, I mean, how
can I not believe?

SNN REPORTER
Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder
to heaven?

FAT MAN
If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy,
and the ladder is my penis...  and the
pearly gates are the-

SNN REPORTER
Uh, meanwhile, the American economy
cont-  wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We
are getting reports now that Ja-pan
is building their own ladder to heaven
to compete with the US's's. Let's go
live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa.


SNN CORRESPONDENT
This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting
rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started
buirding its own radder to hayben.
Ahready, the Japanese radder extend
faaar into space  and it's growing by
a-one thousand miles every day.  As
the endeavor continues it is becoing
clear that Japan will reach a-hayben
before the United States.

[South Park, just past sunset. The neighbors have gathered around
the ladder in Stan's back yard and are now singing]

NEIGHBORS
Nahurabo Nahurabo

STAN
Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out
of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build
theh ladder with.

MAN 1
Oh no!

WOMAN 2
Oh Jesus, no!

ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they ran out of
stuff to build the ladder to heaven?


STAN
We can keep going, but we need to start
tearing down houses for wood.

RANDY
No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this
has gone on far enough.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys
the truth, that they aren't really going
to get to heaven.

MAN 2
Wait! Look!

GENERAL
We've come to help you beat those Japs,
boys!  There won't be anyone stopping
this great ladder from being built today!
Alpha Team! Get that support structure
up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and
recon!

SOLDIERS
Yes sir!

ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they saved that
ladder to heaven?

KYLE
Man, I can't believe how much people
want us to get our winning ticket back.


CARTMAN
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect
on people, Kyle.

[South Park, next day. The boys resume building the ladder, and
they almost break through the cloud above them. Stan is the first
to peer over the clouds. Kyle soon joins him.]

KYLE
Do you see anything?

STAN
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??

KYLE
Grandma??

CARTMAN
Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached
the cloud city yet!

STAN
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven
must still be a long way off.

CARTMAN
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to
say this, but I think maybe we're not
seeing heaven because one of us doesn't
believe in it enough.

KYLE
Huh?

CARTMAN
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries
of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them
if you really believe in them.

STAN
What??

CARTMAN
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven
because one of us is a J-O-O.

KYLE
What does me being a Jew have to do
with anything?!

CARTMAN
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!


KYLE
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!


CARTMAN
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting
five dollars off your matzah ball soup
at Barney's Beanery by lying about a
hair in it.

KYLE
HAAHH!!!

CARTMAN
AH!

[Flashback #2 - Kenny arrives at the bus stop.]

KYLE
Hey Kenny.

STAN
Hey Kenny.

KENNY
(Hey you guys. What's goin' on, man?)


CARTMAN
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He was
born where hungry children cry, kickin',
his whole family resides in the ghetto,
in the ghetto

KENNY
(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching
vagina!)

CARTMAN
What did you say?!

KENNY
(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching
vagina!)

CARTMAN
What did you say?!

CARTMAN
I said "Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching
vagina!"  Did I just call myself a blood-belching
vagina?

STAN
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??


CARTMAN
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like
I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his
eyes.

KYLE
You're too fat to be Kenny.

CARTMAN
You're a- stupid Jew.

STAN
Let's just keep building. We only have
five more days until the shopping spree.


[The White House, Washington D.C., moments later. George Bush
arrives at the Oval Office and takes his seat at the executive
desk]

BUSH
Alright, how's the ladder going, General?
Are we beating the Japanese.

GENERAL
Not quite, but we have a new problem,
Mr. President. Our recon team on the
ladder just found new evidence of threats...
from Saddam Hussein.

BUSH
Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him!
We secretly took him out months ago!


GENERAL
Yes sir. And now we believe he's building
weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.


BUSH
Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't
stop!

GENERAL
These surveillance photos were taken
atop the ladder of what appears to be
heaven.  Here we see what we believe
to be a missile silo. And here  we see
what looks like a laboratory of some
sort for making chemical weapons.


DICK CHENEY
That... kinda looks like a seagull.


GENERAL
Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised
as a seagull.

BUSH
That tricky bastard!

GENERAL
Sir, you must understand our fears.
We must take out those facilities. We
must...  bomb heaven!

[SNN newsroom, new poll]

SNN REPORTER
SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans
believe in heaven, should we bomb it?
The polls right now show that 51% of
Americans think Saddam has to be dealt
with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging
pussies.

WAR PROTESTER
War is not my voice! This country is
just run by rednecks and bumpkins with
their guns!

REDNECK
We have to take Saddam out to protect
ourselves.

FAT MAN
I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein
were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis
were the United States...  then there
would-  hard nipples!

SNN REPORTER
God-damnit!

[News 4 field report]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it's been five days since three
sweet boys set out to build a ladder
to heaven and caption the nation's hearts.
They've made a nation believe heaven
might be up there. And it could prove
to be a threat to our country. President
Bush will seek UN approval for military
action.

[The Marsh home, day. The boys' ladder is seen rising above the
house, in the backyard. In the dining room, the boys' parents
sit opposite the boys at the table.]

RANDY
Boys, it's really neat that you want
to see your old pal Kenny so much but...


KYLE'S FATHER
But it's time for you to get back to
school and on with your lives.

STAN
No, we have to see Kenny!

SHARON
You have to understand that Kenny's
body isn't up in the clouds. He was
cremated.

STAN
Cremated? What's that?

RANDY
When you die, your body is put into
a broiling oven and cooked until you're
nothing but ashes.

KYLE
What?? For God's sake, why??

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, it's just what some people do.


KYLE
Are you gonna burn me?

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, that's not the issue right now.


KYLE
Jesus Christ!

RANDY
The person's ashes are put into an urn,
and that's where Kenny's body is.


KENNY'S MOM
You see boys, Kenny is in here.  What
the???  Wait a minute! This is kitty
litter!

CARTMAN
Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate
milk mix and replaced it with kitty
litter.

STUART
You WHAT??

STAN
Dude, don't you know what this means?
You drank Kenny!

CARTMAN
Shut up!

KYLE
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!


CARTMAN
Shut up!

KENNY'S MOM
Oh my God! This is awful!  And disgusting!


LIANE
Bad, Eric, bad!

CARTMAN
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's
memories all the time. His soul is inside
me.

STAN
Well, so much for our winning ticket.
Cartman probably drank that with the
rest of Kenny!

KYLE
Yeah. Good job, fatass!

CARTMAN
I can't live like this. I, I have to
find a place where they remove living
souls from your body.

[Day, Unplanned Parenthood, a place where they remove living
souls from a pregnant woman's body, if you believe fetuses have
souls... Cartman speaks to the nurse, who is sitting behind a
desk writing absentmindedly]

CARTMAN
Looks like I've come to the right place.


NURSE
Can I help you?

CARTMAN
Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside
of me that needs to be sucked out, please.


NURSE
You'll have to make an appointment;
the charge is two hundred and thirty
dollars.

CARTMAN
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just
want you to vacuum him out of me and
not put him up in a condominium!


BOYFRIEND
It's gonna be okay, babe.

CARTMAN
Listen, lady! You've got to get this
crap out of me!  I don't want him in
me anymore! Just suck him up and throw
him out!

WOMAN
Oh Steven, I can't go through with this!
I have to keep it!

STEVEN
Damnit! Damnit!  Thanks a lot, kid!


CARTMAN
Ey!

[The scene is the sidewalk. Stan, Cartman and Kyle run up to
Kenny]

CARTMAN
Kenny! Kenny!

STAN
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving
away a shopping spree!

KYLE
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!


LOLLY
There you go. Hold on to that ticket
stub.

STAN
You hold on to this, Cartman. I might
lose it.

CARTMAN
Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep
track of it, Kyle.

KYLE
Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much
responsibility. Here, you hold on to
it, Kenny.

KENNY
(Okay.)

CARTMAN
You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny,
or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The
nuts! The nuts!

[Back to the present. Cartman comes to and knows where to go]


CARTMAN
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on
him when he died! He put it away somewhere!
Don't you see? I can still have my
candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You
guys! YOU GUYS!!

[The United Nations, day. In the main hall President Bush is
speaking to the Assembly]

BUSH
Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have
evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there
building weapons of mass destruction.
We have tried to communicate with Saddam
through a psychic to ask him to let
us see his warehouses in heaven. But
he has not responded.

INDIAN AMBASSADOR
Of course he has not responded, because
he's DEAD!

BUSH
Right. Dead, and in heaven.

ANOTHER AMBASSADOR
This is preposterous! Even if there
was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam
Hussein's soul would be sent there?


BUSH
Our intelligence tells us that when
Saddam was originally killed, his soul
actually went to hell. But while in
hell he began a homosexual relationship
with Satan, the Prince of Darkness.
Satan, however, decided he didn't want
to be with Hussein anymore and broke
up with him about August.  When Saddam
became jealous and tried to kill Satan's
new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent
to heaven to live with Mormons as a
punishment.  Question?  Yes?

ANOTHER AMBASSADOR
Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?


BUSH
I assure you, I am not high.

[South Park, day. A tower has gone up around the ladder at the
Marsh house. Helicopters and cranes hoist. On the ground Stan
and Kyle sit on some lumber watching the military take over the
construction. Cartman runs up to them]

CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!


KYLE
What do you mean, fatass?

CARTMAN
I just had another vision, you buttholes.
Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him,
he put it away somewhere.

STAN
Where??

CARTMAN
I don't know. I got conked in the head
down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly
saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little
red box.  I just have to wait for another
vision to come. I could clearly see
through Ken-  AY!

KYLE
Do you see anything?

CARTMAN
Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!

STAN
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We
gotta spark the vision somehow.

CARTMAN
Not by giving me brain damage!

STAN
Do you want a candy shopping spree or
not?!

CARTMAN
Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...


[Near the back of the house. The neighbors are watchng the construction.
Sharon and Sheila arrive]

SHARON
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about
heaven! The Japanese just reached it
with their ladder!

RANDY
What?

[Living room, seconds later]

SHARON
See for yourself!

[the SNN Japanese correspondent is on camera]

SNN CORRESPONDENT
This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting
rive from hayben.  The great a-nation
of Japan reached a-hayben today about
eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh.
Therefore hayben is now a-decrared
an official part of Japan, because we
got a-here first. And now for the weather
in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu.


NATSAKO SEMU
Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.


NOBUNAGA
That's the news from heben.  Dame!
Dame da! Bakayarou da!!

[Living room, seconds later]

RANDY
Oh God, and we told our boys they'd
never reach heaven.

KYLE'S FATHER
Kids!

[Backyard. The crowd in and around the yard is immense now. George
Bush and his staff are present]

BUSH
Good. As soon as the boys finish their
ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam
out.

SHARON
Do you really think this is a good idea,
Randy?

RANDY
If Saddam is building weapons, we have
to stop him. With our weapons.

STAN
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not
working on the ladder anymore. Thank
you, we're done.

SOME GUY
Dude.

GEORGE BUSH
Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese
won't let us use theirs.

KYLE
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It
was in his room. So we got all our candy,
and you can all go home.

RANDY
Wait, are you saying that you boys only
wanted to build a ladder to heaven so
you could get some candy??

CARTMAN
...I've never heard the words "only"
and "candy" in the same sentence before.


FIELD REPORTER
But... what about yoru lost friend?
What about your fragile innocence and
believing we could all get to heaven?


STAN
Yeah, well people make us kids believe
that heaven is this white place with
fluffy clouds and angels...

KYLE
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven
isn't a place you can get to, maybe
heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind
or, or something gay like that. Maybe
heaven... is this moment, right now.


GENERAL
So, you're saying we should bomb this
moment, right now. Right! Johnson!


JOHNSON
Sir!

RANDY
No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These
boys are right. The only heaven we can
hope for is one here on earth, now.
We should stop waiting to get into heaven
and start trying to... create it.


CROWD
Awwww.

BUSH
And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam
could actually be up there buildin'
bombs.

ALAN JACKSON
Where were you when they decided heaven
was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't,
you couldn't really get there?

[walks up to the boys] You little bastards ruined my latest song!
[drives his guitar into the snow, breaking it, then walks away]


KYLE
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over
with. Let's go count our candy.

STAN
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul
is still in Cartman's body.

CARTMAN
No no, I just drank his memories. I'm
not sharing my body with that poor piece
of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat
dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.

KYLE
Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?

CARTMAN
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God!


STAN
Dude, come back here!

KYLE
Stop him, Kenny!

[Heaven. Weapons of mass destruction are seen among the clouds.
Saddam is right there shouting directions]

SADDAM HUSSEIN
Keep those nitrogen capsules over there
by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come
on!

GOD
Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that
you're secretly building weapons of
mass destruction up here.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This
is a chocolate chip factory. See?


GOD
It looks like a chemical weapons plant.


SADDAM HUSSEIN
Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build
a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't
make it look like a chemical weapons
plant, would I? I'd make it look like
a chocolate chip factory or something.


GOD
...Alright, just checking.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
Stupid asshole!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 708


"SOUTH PARK IS GAY!"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, school bus stop, morning. Stan, Cartman and Kenny
wait for the bus. Stan is dressed in fishnet tank top, artsy
pants, and a new, furry cap with the same colors as his old one.
Cartman is dressed in a Madonna fashion shirt and artsy pants.
His hair is tussled and brighter than usual. Kenny is dressed
in a purple parka with light purple sleeves. A lock of his hair
peeks out from under the hood.]

STAN
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe
what happened to me last night.

CARTMAN
What? Tell us?

STAN
So, I'm watching the season premiere
of Boy Meets Boy on television, and
then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy
come on, right? So I fall asleep in
front of the TV, and when I wake up,
I see that I've spilled the Coke I was
drinking all over my satin pajama top.


CARTMAN
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was
the cutest top ever!

STAN
I know!

KENNY
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's
SOOO beautiful!)

STAN
Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.

KYLE
Hey dudes.

CARTMAN
What a dork!

KYLE
What?

CARTMAN
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really
the hot fabric this fall!

KYLE
Well, but, this is the jacket I always
wear.

STAN
You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.


CARTMAN
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th.


STAN
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your
neck. Are you using any exfoliating
products at all??

CARTMAN
We can't let Kyle out in public like
this, you guys.

KENNY
(That's the truth.)

STAN
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover!


[MONTAGE
The boys take Kyle to a clothing store
and give him some suits to try out.
They choose an outfit and haul him off
to the next store, a barbershop. A woman
styles Kyle's hair. Next is a pedicure.
Kyle wears the outfit Kenny chose. Next
stop: Forever 16, and finally Marcy's.
Next, all four of them are getting facials.
The last scene is of the four boys walking
down the middle of the street, all dressed
in new clothes. Cartman takes off his
shades and the camera enters his eye]


SINGERS (WIDELIFE)
You... came into my life... and my world
never looked so bright. Yeah.

It's true. You bring out the best in me.

When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep
getting better.

It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better
(All things just keep getting better).

[The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila watch TV from their
couch]

ANNOUNCER
Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for
the Staight Guy!

CARSON
We have got to get you some tighter-fitting
shirts!

ANNOUNCER
Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by
Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat...
with Men.

KYLE'S MOTHER
My goodness, there certainly are a lot
of gay shows on television these days.


KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are
finally being so accepted.

KYLE
Hi Mom, Hi Dad!

KYLE'S FATHER
HAAAAAA!!!  Kyle! What's happened to
you??

KYLE
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't
be such a drama queen!

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila!  We'd better
go tell the other parents what's going
on!!

[The Marsh house. Gerald is pounding on the front door and Sharon
answers.]

SHARON
Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.

KYLE'S FATHER
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you
about the boys.

SHARON
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching
TV.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, is the game on or something?

RANDY
Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!!


OTHER MEN
Geraaald! Hi Gerald.

STUART
Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the
Straight Guy is on.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too??


RANDY
Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.

KYLE'S FATHER
What's that?

SKEETER
Just because a guy cares about how he
looks and is in touch with his feminine
side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.


STUART
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight,
but you appreciate the gay culture.


RANDY
It's super-fabulous. Would you like
some shirazz?

[The ladies look on from the kitchen]

SHARON
Don't our men look

LINDA
Haven't you seen Quuer Eye For the Straight
Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around
and show straight men how to better
themselves. It's the best.

KYLE'S MOTHER
It is?

SHARON
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are
all so clean and neat. My Randy irons
his clothes and even has pedicures.


LINDA
And they like to talk about their feeling
now and drink wine and decorate the
house.

SARAH
My Steven shaved his chest and his balls.
OOOO, I love it!

SHARON
And how about our boys, huh? Ever since
gay culture became cool, our boys bathe
every night and brush their teeth three
times a day. This is the greatest thing
ever.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural
fads too far...

[South Park, day. The boys go to school in their new threads.
They stop at the main entrance]

STAN
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see
how gay I look!

CARTMAN
That's true, you guys. When the chicks
at school see how gay we are, they're
gonna be all over us.

KENNY
(Woohoo!!)

STAN
All right. Let's work it!  What the...?


BUTTERS
Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.


CONNOR
Okay, sweetums.

CLYDE
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I
am fr-eaking a-out!

A BOY
Hey dudes.

STAN
Hey Craig.

CRAIG
You guys look pretty gay.

KYLE
Thanks.

CRAIG
Not as gay as us, though.

CARTMAN
Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer
than you!

CRAIG
Oh yeah?! We're superduper triple-dog
gay!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! We're all just super stamp
it stamp it no erasies mega gay!

CHEF
What's all this fightin' about, children?!


STAN
These guys are trying to say they're
gayer than us!

CHEF
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have
taken up this whole metrosexual fad,
too!

STAN
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is
who we are!

CHEF
No it isn't. Last year you children
were all trying to be black, and now
you're trying to be gay!

STAN
We're metrosexual!!

CRAIG
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual
as us! Come on, fags!

CARTMAN
GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a...
djah!!

KYLE
Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.


CHEF
Well, then, don't buy into this fad,
Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.


MR. GARRISON
All right children, let's take our seats.


CLASS
Good morning Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.


TIMMY
Oooo, Timmy.

STAN
Dude! W-what are you doing?

KYLE
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff,
dude. I'm just being me.

CRAIG
HA! Told you you guys were straight!


STAN
We're not straight! You're straight!


CARTMAN
You're straight like a freedway!

MR. GARRISON
What the hell is going on??

CARTMAN
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you
dreams!!

CRAIG
I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite.


CARTMAN
...So? I'm half bisexual!

MR. GARRISON
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know
what you're talking about!! Eric, you're
not half-bi!!

CARTMAN
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was
bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.

MR. GARRISON
WHAT??

[Nighttime. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave walk down the street.]


MR. GARRISON
It was the crazies thing I've ever seen,
Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly
acting like being gay was cool. I mean,
maybe we're not the only gay couple
in town anymore.

MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jethuth Chritht.

[The bar, inside. Disco music is playing. Mr. Garrison looks
in awe at the metrosexuals now milling about.]

MR. GARRISON
Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth
over.

MR. SLAVE
Jethuth Chritht.

JIMBO
Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.


MR. GARRISON
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit,
too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna
come back to my place with me and Mr.
Slave?

JIMBO
Uh, for what?

MR. GARRISON
Well, you know...

JIMBO
No.

MR. GARRISON
Huh.

RANDY
Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.

MR. GARRISON
Oh hey Randy.

RANDY
You're looking ultra-fabulous.

MR. GARRISON
Wull thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy,
you want me to give you a hand job in
the bathroom?

RANDY
Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.


MR. GARRISON
Not, not like that?

RICHARD
How about some shirazz, guys?

MR. GARRISON
Uh-OH, thanks, Mr. Tweek.

RICHARD
My pleasure, silly-buns.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't
we uh, go back to my place.

RICHARD
Why?

MR. GARRISON
Well, you know, I was just thinking
we could... put on some music and watch
videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little
ass.

MR. SLAVE
Woohoohoohoo, Jethuth Chritht.

RICHARD
Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.


MR. GARRISON
Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what
the hell is goin' on here?!

PATRONS
Huh?

MR. GARRISON
Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's
butt?!

RANDY
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison,
we're straight.

MR. GARRISON
Those pants and those shoes say you
pound butt!!

JIMBO
Heeey, now that's not true. My shoes
don't say I pound butt.

MR. GARRISON
No, your shoes say you take it in the
butt!!

SKEETER
'Sokay, Mr. Garrison. We learned that
gays are totally cool. You're just one
of us now.

PATRONS
Yeah.

MR. GARRISON
One of you?!  We've spent our whole
lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You
can't do this to us!!

[South Park Elementary, playground, day]

CARTMAN
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner
that you can leave in, and it detoxifies
the scalp.

STAN
Wow, is that from Origins?

CARTMAN
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-


KYLE
Hey guys. You wanna throw the football
around?

CARTMAN
Guys, can I talk to you over here for
a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the
kids in school are talking, okay? And
they're spreading rumors that we're
not metrosexuals because... we hang
out with Kyle.

STAN
Well, what can we do about it?

CARTMAN
We have no choice, you guys. We're just
gonna have to kill Kyle.

STAN
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have
to kill Kyle! We would just to tell
him not to hang around us anymore.


CARTMAN
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We
just have to tell Kyle not to hang around
us anymore.

STAN
Yeah. Wait, what?

CARTMAN
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we
should tell Kyle not to hang around
us anymore. I think he's right. Good
luck telling him, Stan. I... know it
won't be easy.

CRAIG
Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got
there.

TOKEN
When was the last guy you had a manicure,
straight man?

JASON
Yeah, let's see that hair.  Look, he's
not even using any product!

STAN
Hey, what's goin' on?

CRAIG
Oh, here come the butch boys to help
their butchy little friend!

CARTMAN
He's not our friend.

KYLE
Stan?

JASON
This playground is for metrosexuals,
macho man!

CRAIG
Take your non-flaming ass to some other
school!

KYLE
No! Ah!

[South Park sign, now with a bed of flowers under it]

[The Broflovski house. Kyle returns with bruises all over his
body. His mom is dusting]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle! What happened to you?!

KYLE
I got beat up at school... for being
different.

KYLE'S MOTHER
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for
being a Jew?

KYLE
No! For not being a metrosexual.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Gerald! Gerald, get down here!

KYLE'S FATHER
Heeere I come!

KYLE
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle! You look terrible!

KYLE'S MOTHER
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.


KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry,
Kyle. We can cover that black eye up
with some cream base, and the coat and
pants we'll bleach with an acid wash
for a fun vintage look.

KYLE
Gah! Just leave me alone!

A VOICE
There you go! Now you look fabulous.


KYAN
You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders
for your look.

KYLE
GRRRRR!!

THOM
Now let's get down to the tango class
and learn some new steps.

KYLE
That does it! I know what I have to
do!

[Chef's house, day. Mr. Garrison rings the bell]

CHEF
Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.

MR. GARRISON
Chef, can I talk to you?

CHEF
Sure. Come on in.

MR. GARRISON
Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just
awful, Chef! I used to feel like an
outsider, a totally different person
who stood out in this town! Now every
straight guy is acting gayer than me!


MR. SLAVE
Oh Jethuth! Jethuth Chritht!

CHEF
Well, what do you want me to do about
it?

MR. GARRISON
Chef, what did you do when white people
stole your culture?

CHEF
Oh. Well, we black people just always
tried to stay out in front of them.


MR. SLAVE
How did you do that?

CHEF
Well, like with our slang. Black people
always used to say, "I'm in the house"
instead of "I'm here." But then white
people all started to say "in the house"
so we switched it to "in the hizzouse."
Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then
white folk started saying that, and
we had to change it to hizzie, then
"in the hizzle" which we had to change
to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because
white people say "hizzle fo shizzle,"
we have to say "flippity floppity floop."


MR. GARRISON
We don't have time for all that, Chef!
Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the
Straight Guy people understood what
they were doing.  Wait.  That's it!
I know exactly what to do!  Come on,
Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity
floppity floop.

CHEF
Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that!


[South Park Train Station. Kyle approaches a ticket booth]

KYLE
One ticket to New York, please.

CLERK
You're going to New York alone?

KYLE
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the
Straight Guy people.

CLERK
Oooo, great idea! They can help you
with those dated clothes.

KYLE
Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
Kyle, what are you doing here?

KYLE
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer
Eye For the Straight Guy people!

MR. GARRISON
What?? That's what I'm doing!

KYLE
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to
kill them first!

MR. GARRISON
They took gay culture from real gays
and their asses are ours!

KYLE
I thoght of it first!

MR. GARRISON
No you didn't! No you didn't!

KYLE
Did so! Did so!

MR. GARRISON
I thought of it yesterday!

KYLE
I thought of it two days ago!

MR. GARRISON
I thought of it before you were born!


MR. SLAVE
Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you
see how crazy this is?

MR. GARRISON
Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can
both kill them together.

KYLE
Cool.

[South Park Mall, day. The boys are at a clothing store]

STAN
Wow, we look great!

CARTMAN
Yeah, and let's see Craig outgay us
now.

RANDY
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale
down in Express for Men!  Hey guys!
There's a sale in Express for Men!


RICHARD
Oh my God!

MAN
Let's go! Let's go!

MAN 2
You guys have got to see these shoes
I bought!

KYLE'S FATHER
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in
seven hours! Oh, why can't we all live
at the mall?!

SHARON
You know, I'm starting to think this
whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.


LINDA
I know what you mean. All my husband
ever does now is look at himself in
the mirror. He cares more about how
he looks than how I look.

MRS. TWEEK
I hope something happens soon to put
an end to this whole fad.

[HBC Television Headquarters, New York. The head of programming
is with the Queer Eye guys]

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer
Eye For the Straight Guy is our number
one show!

CARSON
What can I say? We're fabulous.

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
You guys are changing the world! And
tomorrow, we're gonna have you make
over the President of the United States!


JAI
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint.


MR. GARRISON
Room service.

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
What? We didn't order any room service.


MR. GARRISON
Oh, well, the woman at the front desk
sent it up.

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Carol?  Well, I'll have to check on
this. Excuse me a minute, fellas.


KYLE
Clear!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, Mr. Slave!

MR. SLAVE
Unh, Jethuth  Chritht.

MR. GARRISON
Well crap, that didn't work.

[South Park Mall, day. Stan and his group face off against Craig
and his group at the center of the mall]

STAN
You'd better shut up, Craig.

CRAIG
Everyone knows it's true!

STAN
It is not!

CRAIG
Is so!

TOM
Craig! Behave yourself!

RANDY
Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting
about?

STAN
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his
dad can outdress you!

RANDY
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight
about.

TOM
Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress
better than Randy.

RANDY
Oh really?!

TOM
I mean, you do have the fashion sense
of a Japanese woman.

SOME MEN
Ooooo.

RANDY
Please, girlfriend. You look like some
kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.


OTHER MEN
Oh no, errrr!

SHARON
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop
it?!  Look, you guys are carrying this
fad too far! Will you please stop acting
this way?!

TOM
You don't... like us being metrosexual?


THE WOMEN
NO!

RANDY
Well, you know what I think? I think
you're all metrophobic!

THE MALES
Yeah!!

LINDA
What?

JIMBO
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves,
we should be uniting against metrophobes
like these!

SHARON
This is crazy!

RANDY
Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us
what you want. But us metros are real
people, just like you!

TOM
You can metrobash us all you want,
but we're here to stay!

CRAIG
Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.


CARTMAN
That's right. Proud. You know what
I think, guys? I think we should have
a metrosexual pride parade.

RYAN
Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual
awareness!

STUART
We can make floats and decorate them
with streamers and flowers!

KENNY
(Woohoohoo!)

RANDY
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and
into the streets!

THE MALES
Out of the malls and into the streets!
Out of the malls and into the streets!
Out of the malls and into the streets!


MRS. TWEEK
What the hell did that show do to them?


[HBC Television Headquarters, New York. Police have been called
in and have apprehended Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle]


OFFICER
You sure you don't want to press charges?


KYAN
That's okay, officer. I think they learned
murder is wrong.

CARSON
Especially in those pants.

MR. GARRISON
Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to
murder you, but... You have to stop
what you're doing!

JAI
Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing
on TV!

MR. GARRISON
But don't you see the price? You're
selling out your own kind. Look, us
gays have created a lifestyle, a, a
culture that is uniquely ours. If we
keep trying to make straight people
into us, well, we're gonna have no identity
left.

KYAN
Sorry Charlie, no sale.

MR. GARRISON
Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!
How can gay men do this to their own
people??  Unless... you're not gay at
all...

THOM
You just had to push it, didn't you?!


JAI
Just had to keep asking question!

CARSON
Now you know the truth!

KYLE
They aren't gay? Then what are they?


KYAN
We're a thousand years our kind have
lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished
by man in the Kindling Wars.

MR. GARRISON
Oh my God.

LEADER
We are the Crab People!

KYLE
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!

MR. SLAVE
Jethuth Chritht!

THE QUEER EYE GUYS
Craaab People! Craaab People! Craaab
People!

[A subterranean cave. The crab people lead their hostages to
their camp. "Craaab People! Craaab People! Craaab People!"]


CRAB LEADER
See now where we have been forced to
live for a thousand years! But soon
we shall rule the land above, and mankind
will be gone!

MR. GARRISON
Gone??

CRAB MAN 2
Crab people are too small and weak to
take over man by force, and so we came
up with our perfect plan!

CARSON REPLICA
If you can't beat man,  change man!


MR. GARRISON
I knew it! I knew gay people would never
do this to their own kind!

CRAB LEADER
When all the world is metrosexual, the
crab people shall finally reign supreme!!


CRAB PEOPLE
Craaab People! Craaab People!

CRAB SOLO
Taste like crab, talk like people.


CRAB PEOPLE
Craaab People!

KYLE
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual!
I like being a dirty, filthy little
boy!

CRAB MAN 2
Very well. If we can't make you into
metrosexuals, then we will make you
into crab people! Take them!!

Singers

(CRAB PEOPLE)
All things just keep getting better


You... came into my life

(Crab People)

and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.

(Crab People)

It's true. You bring out the best in me.

(Crab People)

When you are around, when you are around,

(Crab People)

All things just keep getting better.

(Crab People)

[South Park, day. A Metrosexual Pride Parade moves down the street
in the background, and News 4 is covering it.]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado,
where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade
is underway!

THE BOYS
We're here!

We're not queer! [clap clap]

But we're clsoe! [clap clap]

Get used to it!

We're here! [clap clap]

We're not queer! [clap clap]

But we're clsoe! [clap clap]

Get used to it!

SHARON
That does it! I can't take it anymore!


THE BOYS
We're here!

We're not queer! [clap clap]

But we're clsoe! [clap clap]

Get used to it!

LINDA
I should have never wished for a cleaner,
neater husband.

SHARON
Ladies, get yoru things! I know what
we have to do!

JIMBO
Whoa, look out!

RANDY
Oh my God, it's on fire!

SKEETER
Put it out! Put it out!

RANDY
I can't do anything! These are brand-new
pants!

SKEETER
The heat could really damage our hair.
We'd better let the police handle this!


OFFICER BARBRADY
Are you crazy? I just had my uniform
pressed!

JIMBO
Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!


SKEETER
Eeeek!

RANDY
Put it out! Put it out! Fire!

[HBC Headquarters, New York. The Queer Eye guys work on President
Bush on their show]

CARSON
Mr. President, it is such an honor to
make you over!

KYAN
Now, we've got to do something with
yoru hair.

THOM
And your nails are filthy. Let's get
those clean.

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
This is gay gold!

MR. GARRISON
Stop them! They're crab people!

CRAB MAN 3
They cannot see or hear us, foolish
man. Now stand by and watch as your
pitiful race becomes helplesss!!

CARSON
That is very good, Mr. President. Now,
put on this silk jacket.

KYLE
No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!


MR. GARRISON
You bastards!

KYAN
That looks great! Now, how about some
moisturizer.

SHARON
There they are! Get 'em!

KYAN
What?

LINDA
You turned our husbands into whiny little
wusses!!

SARAH
It's payback time!

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Oh my God, what are they doing?!

CRAB MAN 3
Oh noooo!!

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Wha? What have you done?

SHARON
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice.
You see, at first we liked having our
men be clean and neat. We thought that
having them use product in their hair
and wanting facials would make them
sexier. But it doesn't.

LINDA
That's right. Event though my Steven
sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged
manly grossness that I'm attracted to.


SARAH
We're sorry, but we knew that the only
answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.


HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Well you're going to jail for thi-!
Wait a minute.  What is that?

CRAB LEADER
No! Our evil plans! Noooo...

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Oh my God. They were crab people.

MR. GARRISON
Yes! They were tryingn to systematically
make men into wusses so they could take
over the world!

KYLE
Mom!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle!

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
I should have known they were crab people.
They tried this before with The Jefferson.


MR. GARRISON
So now, can you please change your network's
programming?

HEAD OF PROGRAMMING
Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over.
Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're
gonna bring back the Latin fad.

[South Park. The sign has been redrawn with a barrio graffiti
font.]

[The McCormick house, day. Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter, and Stuart
are now dressed as cholos on the porch. Two six-packs of Coronas
are on the ground. Some of the bottles are already empty]

RANDY
Hey eses.

STUART
Hey Jefey. You want some cerveiza?


[South Park Elememtary, day. Kyle walks into view in the school
hall]

STAN
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play

KYLE
What? Y-you want me to hang out with

STAN
Yeah. It's cool, holmes.

KYLE

it all and, and hang out with you again
like nothing happened?

STAN
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny

CARTMAN
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude!

"HOW TO EAT WITH YOUR BUTT"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary School Gym, day. Stan is seated on a stool
none too pleased before a backdrop of a meadow. Behind the photographer
are the kindergartners and Mr. Adler's class]

PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, now lift your chin a little.
Look right here. Right here.  Hey, where's
my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile
for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile.
There it is.  Okay great next.

STAN
I didn't smile.

KYLE
I hate picture day at school! It's always
some gay-ass photographer with some
gay-ass backdrop of New England!

BUTTERS
Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to
make sure I look good this time in...
the school pictures.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, smile  Okay, next?

STAN
Did you go yet?

KYLE
No. This is taking forever.

CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!


KYLE
What, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Dude, check it out: for picture day,
Kenny got into hiis parka backwards,
so that his ass shows through his hood.
Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here!


KYLE
It isn't that funny, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Yes it is!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Next in line! Come on, let's keep it
moving, kids!

CARTMAN
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny,
it's totally funny.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Take off your hat, please?

KYLE
But I never take off my hat.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Come on now, I bet your parents want
a picture of YOU lookin' natural.


KYLE
This is how I look natural.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Kyle, we're taking pictures without
hats today!

KYLE
Crap!

PHOTOGRAPHER
Snile! Come on, where's that smile?
Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see
a smile.

KYLE
Gayass!

PHOTOGRAPHER
Very nice. Okay, last one?

CARTMAN
Uh oh.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay, have a seat, young man.  Well,
okay, lookin' great.Now where's that
smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide
smile. Wider. Perfect!

CARTMAN
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures
back?

PHOTOGRAPHER
Should be about four days.

CARTMAN
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that
long!

[South Park Elementary, four days later, day. Inside, in Ms.
Choksondik's class, Cartman is fidgeting rather loudly in his
desk]

CARTMAN
Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!
C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, class, I have your school photos
to hand out-

CARTMAN
YES! YES!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Most of them are very nice. But, apparently,
one of you thinks it's fun to spoil
their school pictures , and thinks he's
a comedian. That person will be spending
the afternoon in the principal's office!


KENNY
:	(Aww, that's bullshit!)

MS. CHOKSONDIK
School photos aren't for joking around,
so you aren't getting your photo back,
Butters!

BUTTERS
Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
For the rest of you, I think your pictures
turned out very nicely.

BUTTERS
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a
minute!

CARTMAN
Let me see!

BUTTERS
Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look
stupid in my picture. Honest!

CARTMAN
Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the
sweetest thing I've ever done!

KENNY
(You've ever done?!)

CARTMAN
Look at how the crap ...is sittin'
right in the middle!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell
at Butters!

CARTMAN
Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!


MS. CHOKSONDIK
You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks,
it's Choksondik! Say it right or you
can go to the principal's with Butters!


CARTMAN
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.

BUTTERS
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.


MS. CHOKSONDIK
Your mother is waiting for you in the
principal's office.

BUTTERS
My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!

CARTMAN
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to
see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna
put it on the Internet or... No, wait!
Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea...
ever!

[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A receptionist in blue suit sits
at her desk. The doors open and Cartman enters]

RECEPTIONIST
Welcome to South Park Milk Company.
Can I help you?

CARTMAN
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family
who has a missing child, and I was wondering
if you could print his photo on your
milk carton?

RECEPTIONIST
Oh, of course. Printing those photos
on our milk really does help. Do you
have the photo with you?

CARTMAN
Yes, I have it right hmya.

RECEPTIONIST
O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.


CARTMAN
You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for
your help.

RECEPTIONIST
Sure. If I could get a description of
the child to pring underneath the photo?


CARTMAN
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond
hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.
Brown eye!

RECEPTIONIST
Okay, brown eye...

CARTMAN
And, and big rosy cheeks!

RECEPTIONIST
...Full cheeks...

CARTMAN
Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown
eye winking!

[Stan's house, day. A TV is heard.]

REPORTER
Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to
be run over by a motorcycle this week,
leaving a city to ponder, who will be
next?

KYLE
Hello?

CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! You guys!

KYLE
Hello?

CARTMAN
...You guys!...

KYLE
Cartman?

CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry.


STAN
What's he want?

KYLE
I don't know. Let's go see.

[Cartman's house, minutes later. Cartman can be heard laughing
inside as Stan and Kyle approach his door. Kyle rings the doorbell
and Cartman answers, still laughing.]

KYLE
Why'd you call us?

CARTMAN
Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this
is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this
is sooo sweet!

STAN
Goddamnit Cartman, what?!

KYLE
...You put Kenny's pictuer on a milk
carton??

CARTMAN
Look at, look at the description. Brown
eye!

STAN
That isn't funny, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha
this is certainly funny!!

KYLE
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there
really are couples out there who are
missing children.

CARTMAN
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you
guys.

[A house in Wisconsin. A woman enters her kitchen with some groceries
and sets them on the kitchen counter next to the sink. She pulls
them out one by one, but stops when she pulls out the milk carton.]


WOMAN
Oh my God. Oh my God!  Steven! Steven,
come quick!

STEVEN
What is it, Martha?

MARTHA
Look. It's him! It's... our son.

STEVEN
Our ssson!

[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day, a few days later. The Wisconsin
couple are at the Dairy Gold Milk Company, talking to the receptionist.
Their "s" and sometimes "th" comes out sounding like a raspberry]


MARTHA
...and so that's when I called out to
my husband. I just knew the boy picture
on your milk carton was our little Tommy.


RECEPTIONIST
... yes, I see.  Uh, but the child
on the milk carton was reported missing,
not found.

STEVEN
We realize that. But we just thought
that maybe someone else had found Tommy,
and then lost him again. We're pretty
certain that it's our boy, considering
his physical appearance. Martha and
I have the... same condition.

RECEPTIONIST
...Riiight.

STEVEN
You may not have realized this, but
we actually have buttocks where our
heads should be.

RECEPTIONIST
...Really?

STEVEN
Yes.

MARTHA
Steven and I have a comdition called
"torsonic polarity symdrome." It's a
birth defect that's passed on genetically.


STEVEN
Over eleven people worldwide suffer
from TPS

RECEPTIONIST
Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.


STEVEN
Martha and I were lucky enough to meet
each other at a TPS convention in France.


RECEPTIONIST
So... do you have heads down where your
rear ends should be?

STEVEN
No no, don't be silly. You see, with
TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior
only. Behind this we still have all
our vital head organs - tongue, eyes,
nasal passages...

RECEPTIONIST
Well, Mr. and Mrs...

STEVEN
Uh, Thompssson.

RECEPTIONIST
...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young
boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps
we can all visit him together.

MARTHA
Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to
see Tommy again!

STEVEN
Now, Martha, what did I say about getting
our hopesss up?

MARTHA
You're right. You're right.

[Cartman's house, moments later. Cartman is laughing his ass
off on the sofa when Stan and Kyle return to see him.]

KYLE
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this
time?

CARTMAN
Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.
Okay, okay, so get this, get this:
The milk company calls me, right?  And
they call me and say that two people
from Wisconsin... saw the picture of
Kenny on the milk carton, and they think
it's their kid.

STAN
...Dude, that's not funny if they're
missing their son.

CARTMAN
No, nonono! Because apparently these
two people... also kind of look like
they have butts where their heads should
be!

KYLE
...Nuh uh.

CARTMAN
Oh yes! And the best part is... they're
coming here, to my house. And it's gonna
be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably
them now! Okay, you guys, just play
it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No,
sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.
Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh.


MARTHA
Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.


CARTMAN
Oh God.

KYLE
Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!

STAN
No way!

STEVEN
We understand you've seen our son.


CARTMAN
Oh my... God.

STAN
Cartman, where are you going??

MARTHA
Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything
about this?

KYLE
Uh

STAN
Oh boy.

KYLE
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation,
you yuhou'd better go to Kenny's house.


STAN
Yeah. He lives about four houses away
in the bad side of tahown.

MARTHA
Oh thank you. Thank you!

RECEPTIONIST
Well?

STEVEN
They said to inquire four houses down.


MARTHA
Let's hurry!

[Cartman's room, moments later. Cartman is at a loss for words
and looks scared. The door opens and Kyle and Stan walk in.]


KYLE
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you
doing?

STAN
Yeah, you missed them turning around.


CARTMAN
You guys, something's wrong.

STAN
What?

CARTMAN
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest
thing I'll ever see. And I... think...
I... blew a funny fuse.

KYLE
Blew a funny fuse?

CARTMAN
It was just too much and my sense of
humor overloaded.  I don't think anything
will ever be funny again. Oh God. What
have I got?

CLYDE
You mean they both have butts instead
of heads?

STAN
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're
over at Kenny's.

TOKEN
How do they eat?

STAN
How the hell should we know?

KYLE
:	Butters! Hey Butters! You have to
check this out!

BUTTERS
W-what?

KYLE
You gotta come to Kenny's house with
us.

STAN
There's these two people with asses
where their heads should be.

BUTTERS
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded
for lookin' stupid in my school picture.


STAN
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!


CAROL
Butters can't come out and play, boys.
He thinks it's funny to look like a
jackass in his school pictures that
I have to pay for!

BUTTERS
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't
mean to look... like a jackass, eh.
It just happened.

CAROL
You made a goofy face!

BUTTERS
No! That's just what I look like. See?


CAROL
...Don't you make that face at me,
young man!

BUTTERS
I'm not makin' a face, mom!

CAROL
Stop it!

CRAIG
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.


KYLE
Alright.

CAROL
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop
making that stupid face at me, you can
just stay in your room for another week!


BUTTERS
Another week?  I hate my stupid face.


[Mr. Mackey's office, day. Cartman is on the couch laying on
his back...]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want
you to feel comfortable talking about
anything, m'kay?

CARTMAN
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you
can see something so funny that it ruins
your sense of humor forever?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well, I can't think of anything that
would be THAT funny.

CARTMAN
Two people with asses for heads. Ever
since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you
used to think was funny?

CARTMAN
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty
jokes, funny movies, seeing someone
die... This morning, I even saw a little
girl get her fingers caught in a car
poicture and... I couldn't laugh. I
mean I... I knew it was funny, but I
couldn't laugh.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well Eric, I suppose that, just like
everything else, laughter can be relative
- in, in other words, sometimes people
see somethin' so scary that nothin'
else scares them, so, the same could
be true for funny things.

CARTMAN
So does that mean I'll never laugh
again?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know,
if you have completely lost your sense
of humor, you can always become a writer
for the show, "Friends" .Ohokahay, huhuh.


CARTMAN
Ugh.

[The McCormick house, later. The Thompsons' car is parked outside,
on the street. Inside, the McCormicks, the Thompsons and the
receptionist are seated around the coffee table. A brick has
replaced two of its legs. Kenny stands beside his mother.]


MRS. MCCORMICK
...and so you see, our son was just
playing a joke and the little fat kid
put it on the carton.

MARTHA
Yes. Yes, I see.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons
an apology?

MARTHA
...No, it was foolish for us to get
our hopes up.

STEVEN
It was just such a coincidence, considering
the photo. You may not have realized
this, but Martha and I have buttocks
where our heads should be.

STUART AND WIFE
Really?

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has
it been since you've seen your son?


STEVEN
Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.


MARTHA
Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening
all over again.

MRS. MCCORMICK
There there now.

RECEPTIONIST
Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright.
Listen, the South Park Dairy Company
is the country's largest. We find lost
children all the time.  We can help
you find Tommy with the company's database!


MRS. MCCORMICK
Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find
your son. Just stop cryin', Please,
for the love of God, stop cryin'!


MARTHA
Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Thompson, how did your son become
missing? Was he abducted?

STEVEN
Yes. He was in the care of our nanny
at the time.

MARTHA
The nanny that we trusted so much took
off with him and we still don't know
why.  We think perhaps she wanted a
child of her own.

RECEPTIONIST
And this was back in Wisconsin?

STEVEN
Yes, but we last heard the nanny was
heading west.  That's why we thought
Colorado made sssssense.

MARTHA
We've tried every avenue to find him,
but, we've never tried the milk company.


RECEPTIONIST
Well you just give us a try. I think
you'll find that South Park Milk  is
not only the best resource for finding
kids,  but also the best producer of
the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world
can offer.

MARTHA
Thank you. Thank you so much for helping
us.

STEVEN
This certainly is a friendly town.
You've all been sssssso wonderful.


MARTHA
Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry
again.

[The Bijou Theater, day. "Grossout Comedy 8" is playing there.
Inside, Cartman sits amid a bunch of older folk]

MALE 1
Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's
panties?

MALE 2
I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's
were in the wash.  Look, can we just
get this over with?

MALE 1
But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's
my grandpa!

MALE 2
Come on, dude.

MALE 1
Oh, alright Here it goes. Come'ere,
Grandpa.

AUDIENCE
Aww

CARTMAN
Oh, dude, oh.

TEEN
Dude, what's wrong with you?

CARTMAN
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-

MALE 1
Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd
better go back to the house now to see
how Chris is doing.

[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. An official leads the Thompsons
through the factory. Cows are lined up in their stalls eating
from personal troughs.]

PRESIDENT
Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President
of the South Park Milk Company, I want
to apologize personally for printing
that falsified picture on our milk cartons.


STEVEN
Please, please. It's not your fault.


PRESIDENT
Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk
we strive for excellence. For instance,
we are now entering the extraction room.
As you can see, we keep it close to
the refrigeration room. That way we
can get the milk to the container as
fast as possible.  That's why some say
South Park milk tastes like you're suckin'
it right from the cow's tits yourself.


MARTHA
Amazing.

PRESIDENT
Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin
D. And our fresh scones.

STEVEN
Delicious.

MARTHA
Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult
to drink with our condition.

STEVEN
Martha and I actually have buttocks
where our heads should be.

PRESIDENT
Really? Well. And in here we have our
Missing Child Resource Center.

MARTHA
Oh my, isn't this impressive?

PRESIDENT
Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk
can search a database of over 30 million
missing child cases.

MRS. GARTHUNK
We'll start the computer on a data
search. Now, when did your son turn
up missing?

STEVEN
Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six
at the time.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Alright then. Computer...

COMPUTER
Workiiing.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Run a scan of missing children since
1982. Check for physical birth defects
called TPS.

COMPUTER
TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child
missing since 1982. Workiiing.

PRESIDENT
So you actually haven't seen your son
in over 20 years?

MARTHA
That's right.

MRS. GARTHUNK
But then, why did you think the picture
of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son
be much older now?

STEVEN
Yes, but since he appeared to be at
least eight in the photo,  we assumed
someone had seen him since we did.


MARTHA
This is the only photo we have of our
little Tommy.

MRS. GARTHUNK
It's gonna take quite a while for the
computer to do a scan of all missing
kids.

PRESIDENT
Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk
do her work, and I'll take you two out
for some good old Colorado chili.


STEVEN
We don't really like chili; it makes
us throw up.

[Cartman's house, living room, day. The door bell rings and Eric
answers it. Jimmy stands at the entrance]

JIMMY
Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad
you called me, very much.

CARTMAN
Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here!

JIMMY
What's this all about?

CARTMAN
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite
standup comic. You've gotta help me.
I've lost my sense of humor.

JIMMY
Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric.
Um comedy can be the best therapy, very
much.

CARTMAN
I just have to find my funny bone again!
Just try and make me laugh.

JIMMY
Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've
been working on my rr... routine.


CARTMAN
Okay, let me have it.

JIMMY
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why
did the... pigeon cross the road?


CARTMAN
Okay, why?

JIMMY
Because it was having sex with the chihi...
Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi...
Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...
eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken.


CARTMAN
...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not
laughing.

JIMMY
Wow, what a great audience... How about
this classic? Knock-knock.

CARTMAN
Who's there?

JIMMY
Orange.

CARTMAN
Orange who?

JIMMY
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n?
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n?
Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange
you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?


CARTMAN
...naw, that didn't work either.

JIMMY
Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.


CARTMAN
Who's there?

JIMMY
An interrupting ca'ow.

CARTMAN
An interrupting cow who

JIMMY
Moooooo!  ...What a terrific audience.


[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. Mrs. Garthunk is still at the
computer doing her search]

MRS. GARTHUNK
Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth
area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?


COMPUTER
Workiiing.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Scan for any children reported found
in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a
facial deformity.

COMPUTER
Workiiing.  Negative.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute,
let's try it this way: Computer?

COMPUTER
Workiiing.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Scan databanks for children who reported
their parents missing.

COMPUTER
Workiiing.  One million six thousand
hits.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Alright, then break it down to claims
in the past twenty years.

COMPUTER
Workiiing.  Three hundred twenty-one
thousand hits.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Alright, now run a scan on homogenized
versus pasteurized skim milk.

COMPUTER
In skim form, homogenized has longer
shelf life by 2.3 weeks.

MRS. GARTHUNK
Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown
of people who are seeking their parents
who also suffer from a disease called
T P S.

COMPUTER
Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a
claim to not know parents: one match


MRS. GARTHUNK
Bingo. Do you have a photo

COMPUTER
Printiiing.

MRS. GARTHUNK
My God. Oh my God!

[Sidewalk, day. Six boys walk down the street again, only Kenny
has replaced Tweek among the boys. They stop at Butters' house
again,and again, Kyle calls out.]

KYLE
Butters! Hey Butters!

BUTTERS
Hehyeah?

KYLE
They found the butt-face people's son,
Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion
at the milk company!

BUTTERS
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas,
but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin'
behavioral problems.

STAN
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your
head?

BUTTERS
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this
paper bag until I learn... to stop makin'
silly faces all the time. They've really
had it up to  here with me.

BUTTERS' DAD
Butters? Are you ready to stop with
the stupid faces?

BUTTERS
I sure am, Dad!

BUTTERS' DAD
Alright, you can take the paper bag
off.

BUTTERS
Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-


BUTTERS' DAD
Oh, very funny, young man! You think
it's clever to make yourself up like
a girl?!

BUTTERS
Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-

BUTTERS' DAD
Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's
gonna be furious!

BUTTERS
I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-

BUTTERS' DAD
Put that bag back on!

BUTTERS
Yes, sir.

KYLE
Dude, that poor kid.

CLYDE
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his
ass tomorrow.

[Cartman's room, day. Cartman sits on his bed dejected. He's
unwrapped a box and a gun sits on his bed to his left, a notepad
and pencil to his right. He picks up the pad and pencil and writes...]


CARTMAN
Dear Mom:


I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without
laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out
to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.


[He sets the notepad down and looks at it for a moment, then
he reaches over for the gun. He opens his mouth and puts the
barrel of the gun in... and bites it off. It's a chocolate gun,
and he sets the remainder down on the bed again.]

CARTMAN

And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.


[He picks up the chocolate again and takes another bite. Then
he looks at the box the gun came in]

CARTMAN

Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the
peanut-butter filled one.


Eric.

[Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A TV 4 news van and crew are present.
Some of the factory workers are present in the background as
the president of the company stands behind some microphones.
The Thompsons stand next to the preisdent. A sign behind them
asks, "Got Missing Kids?"]

PRESIDENT
And so it is with great pride that we
have flown little Billy Thompson out
here, to be reunited with his parents
for the first time in twenty years.
Mrs. Garthunk?

MRS. GARTHUNK
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud
to be an employee of South Park Milk,
which to date has found over a hundred
thousand missing kids, and, led the
way in the fight against curdling. Mr.
and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up
not knowing who his parents were.  But
he was strong and resilient,  and ended
up becoming very successful. I think
it will amaze you as it will all of
us to learn that your son... is Ben
Affleck!

PRESIDENT
Come around here, Ben!

BEN AFFLECK
Mom! Dad!

STEVEN
Son!

MARTHA
Oh, son!

CARTMAN
What's goin' on?

STAN
Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!


STEVEN
Oh, our same ol' Ben!

MARTHA
Oh, I'm so happy!

MR. GARRISON
Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but
I definitely see the resemblance now.


STEVEN
Aw, son.

PRESIDENT
Isn't this wonderful?

PHOTOGRAPHER
Okay gang, give me a big smile.

KYLE
Well, looks like everything turned out
alright for them.

CARTMAN
Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call
him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say
that's funny.

STAN
Hey, you're laughng, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great!
Ben Assfleck!

KYLE
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what
happened?

CARTMAN
A-heh, what?

KYLE
Everything turned out okay for those
people. And so now you can laugh.


STAN
Huh?

KYLE
When Cartman first opened the door,
and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for
playing a joke on them. Now that everything's
turnd out alright, he's able to laugh.


STAN
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling
of remorse.

CARTMAN
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.


KYLE
There is no such thing as a funny fuse,
Cartman. You felt bad.

CARTMAN
Whatever. All I know is that I can
laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat
another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny!


MOTORCYCLE DRIVER
Dangit!

[Stan and Kyle face Cartman. Behind them the crowd consists of
only the camera crew, Mrs. Garthunk, Ben Affleck and the Thompsons,
and the workers]

STAN
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody
and couldn't laugh at them.

KYLE
Our little man is growing up, Stan.
He's growing up.

STAN
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things
are finally gonna start getting a more
sophisticated around here.

[Close-up of the Thompsons taking turns kissing Ben Affleck.
Mrs. Thompson sobs and blows her nose.]

STEVEN
Aw son!

"PREHISTORIC ICE MAN"

Written by

Trey Parker & Nancy Pimental



[Cartman's house. A television is heard. The screen shows an
Australian crocodile hunter narrating his adventures as a woman
pilots his boat down a river.]

AUSSIE
As we steer our boat down , looking
for these dangerous predators Boy,
there's a king croc right here.  He
must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long
at least.  This croc has enough power
in its jaws to rip my head right off.


KENNY
(Oh, no!)

AUSSIE
I've got to be careful. So, what I'm
gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my
thumb in its butthole.

STAN
Holy crap. dude!

AUSSIE
If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers
from the nearest hospital: I'd better
be real careful jamming my thumb in
its butthole.  Oh, boy, it's pissed
off now.

KYLE
Go, dude, go!

AUSSIE
I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole
now! This should really piss it off!
Oh, yeah, that piossed it off, all
right!  I've gotta be careful!

STAN
This guy rules!

KENNY
(He actually killed it!)

CARTMAN
I told you guys.

AUSSIE
Well! That was quite an angry croc!
But I managed to escape with only a
few bruises and a shattered left testicle.
Next week we'll look for more of these
beautiful creatures, so we can learn
more about them by pissing them off
immensely. Thanks for watching.

KYLE
Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!


STAN
Yeah!

[The woods. Cartman leads the boys up a hill. All are armed with
water guns]

CARTMAN
There's bound to be some crocs up here.
I'll use my croc call and try to bring
'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!


KYLE
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass
penis!

CARTMAN
Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle
in the beanbag and see what happens,
by crikey!

KYLE
Get away from me, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Come 'ere, crocky.

KYLE
AAAAAAAAAA!

STAN
Dude!

KYLE
HELP!

STAN
Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!


KENNY
(You bastard!)

CARTMAN
Well, he shouldn't have called me fat.


STAN
Why the hell not?! That's like calling
the sky blue!

CARTMAN
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go
look for crocodiles!

KYLE
You guuuys!

STAN
Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, are you
okay?

KYLE
I think so. Is Cartman up there?

CARTMAN
I'm right here, Kyle.

KYLE
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking
hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face,
pussy!

STAN
Can you climb back up, dude?

KYLE
I don't think so.

STAN
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get
him.

CARTMAN
Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for
crocodi-iles.

[Inside a cave at the bottom of the shaft, Kyle awaits his rescue.
Stan descends, spinning slowly as Cartman huffs outside.]

STAN
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick.
Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.

KYLE
Sick, dude!

STAN
Sorry.  What the hell are you doing,
fat boy?!

CARTMAN
Screw you, hippie!

KYLE
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.


STAN
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait
a minute. What's this?

BOTH
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

KYLE
Dude, it's a dude!

STAN
He's like, some frozen guy.

CARTMAN
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold
up here!

STAN
Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this
in a movie once. The old cavemen get
frozen, and then people discover them
and make them their caveman friends.


KYLE
Wow. Cool.

STAN
You guys, there's a frozen ape man
from the past down here! Send some more
rope!

CARTMAN
Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down
there.

STAN
Help me chip some of the ice away.


CARTMAN
Hey you guys. This is just like that
one movie, um, John Travolta and that,
French chick were doing it, all summer
long and went back to school and sang
somgs about "Greased Lightning."  You
know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks
she's all prissy, and then they try
and try to get an abortion, but she
doesn't have all the-

STAN AND KYLE
Cartman, will you shut the hell up and
get some more rope?!

CARTMAN
Aww, screw you guys anyway!

STAN
Hey, remember when that kid found a
wallet and got a reward?

KYLE
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward
for the frozen guy!

BOTH
Hooray!

CARTMAN
For what?

[on the road towards town. Cartman pulls the frozen man on a
sled while the other three push from behind]

STAN
Where shall we bring it?

KYLE
I don't know. We just have to get it
to town and let them figure out what
to do with it.

STAN
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.


KYLE
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.


STAN
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman
name is Steve?

KYLE
It's my name, and I found him.

STAN
You didn't find him, I found him.

KYLE
What are you talking about, dude?! I
fell down that abyss and there it was!


STAN
You wouldn't even have noticed it if
I hadn't pointed it out.

KYLE
Kenny, who found the ice man?

KENNY
(Well, I think you guys should name
it Steve)

CARTMAN
I think we're almost there, you guys.


[City Hall front lawn. The mayor is at the podium and a crowd
of townspeople is watching]

MAYOR
Aalll right, people. The next order
of business is a very serious matter.
We need to vote on whether South Park
should reinstate the death penalty or
not. All those in favor, say "yippee."


SOME PEOPLE
Yippee.

TARDY MAN
Wait, what was that? I missed the question.
Yippee!

MAYOR
All those opposed, say "nay."

OTHER PEOPLE
Nay.

TARDY MAN
Screw you!

MAN
Ey! Screw you!

STAN
Huh, excuse me?

MAYOR
Not now, kids. Thw town is having a
very important debate on capital punishment.


KYLE
But we found a frozen ice man from the
past!

STAN
I found this frozen guy in the woods
today.

KYLE
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods
today.

MAYOR
What the hell is going on here?

KYLE
We came for our reward.

CARTMAN
Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.


MAYOR
Reward? What reward?

MEPHESTO
Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled
onto something here. You see, Mayor,
frozen links are often found: dinosaur
eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen
could be a missing link  in our evolution.
If I can unfreeze the body, and perform
an autopsy, I could learn much about
this creature's people and its time.


MAYOR
Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your
socks off.

MEPHESTO
Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I
can't give you a reward for finding
this creature, but if you'd like, I'll
let you name him.

STAN
Really.

KYLE
Sweet. How about Steve?

MEPHESTO
Steve it is.

STAN
Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!

MEPHESTO
Come on, Steve. We've got work to do.
Unfreezing this body will be quite
delicate work. We'll have to use the
most advanced methods available.

[The South Park Genetic Enginnering Ranch. Inside, Mephesto and
Kevin use blow dryers on the ice man. Quite an advanced method]


MEPHESTO
This is very exciting. He could be a
Neanderthal. Or an Autralopithecus from
the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that,
Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie
Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes
from Eddie Bauer since 1996!  This
is incredible! Think of all we can learn
from this body! All that it can teach
us! Let's just hope the press doesn't
get wind of this right away.

BARBRADY
Stand back, people. There's nothing
to see here.

REPORTER
What about the prehistoric ice man?


BARBRADY
Oh, yeah. There is that.

REPORTER
Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell
us what's going on?

MEPHESTO
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have
a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion
tha this man has been frozen in time
for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true,
although at this early stage we know
very little about this man or the time
from which he comes.

[News 4 Special Report. The caption has a silhouette of a caveman
stamped with a question mark.]

REPORTER
Fascinating news tonight from South
Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric
man actually frozen in ice. A team of
scientists continues to try and unfreeze
the body so that it can be autopsied,
and studied. The caveman was discovered
by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to
say:

KYLE
Well, I fell down this ice cavern,
and I saw this block of ice, so I told
my friend to throw a rope-

REPORTER
The prehistoric ice man is thought to
be from the late neo-post-Jurrasic era,
where he was probably part of a hunting
and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston
Street.

[The genetic engineering ranch.]

MEPHESTO
That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the
autopsy.

"STEVE"
Uuuurrr.

MEPHESTO
Ugh? What's this?

"STEVE"
Mmmmm.

MAYOR
Holy crap! He's alive??

MEPHESTO
That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him!


"STEVE"
Uugh!

MEPHESTO
My God, he really is alive. The ice
must have preserved him!

MAYOR
Well, quick, do something!

MEPHESTO
Nono, we've got to think this through.
Mayor, this man has not been conscious
for almost three years. He won't understand
what he sees! He'll be frightened and
confused!

MAYOR
Well, you just can't let him die.

MEPHESTO
Perhaps death is better than the shock
he will take trying to adapt to our
time.

"STEVE"
Uh, ughn.

MEPHESTO
Oh my God. It looks as if he's about
to speak!

"STEVE"
Where where am I?

REPORTER 1
What?

REPORTER 2
What's he saying?

REPORTER 3
Is that English?

MEPHESTO
What? You're, you're hungry?

"STEVE"
Where am I?

MEPHESTO
You're, you're hungry?

"STEVE"
What's goin' on?

MEPHESTO
Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to.
Mah-phehs-to.

"STEVE"
Huh?

MEPHESTO
Hawgh! If we could understand what he's
saying, then maybe we could get some
answers.  If only there was someone
who could communicate with him on a
level as primitive as his own, a mind
like a child.

[The boys walk along the curb on their was home]

STAN
Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.

KYLE
Gorak's a gay name.

STAN
No, it isn't!

KYLE
Why are you being such a dick?

STAN
I'm not being a dick, you're being a
dick!

KYLE
Nuh-uh!

BARBRADY
Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs
one of you to help him out in his lab
with the prehitoric ice man.

KYLE
I'll go.

STAN
No, I'll go! I found him!

CARTMAN
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight
like this!

BARBRADY
All right, there's only one fair way
to do this. Everyone stick out their
potatoes.  My mother and your mother
were out hanging clothes. My mother
punched your mother in the nose. What
color blood came out?

KENY
(Blue.)

BARBADY
B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that
means that you will go to the lab and
help out Mephesto and then we can all
go home and watch Murphy Brown.

[The genetic engineering ranch. "Steve" is now sitting up.]


MEPHESTO
Steve. You-

"STEVE"
Where am I?

MEPHESTO
Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve.  Oh good,
you're here.

STAN
Oh my God, they revived Gorak.

KYLE
You bastards!

MEPHESTO
Yes, and I need you to communicate with
him. See if you can understand what
he's saying.

STAN
Uh. Hi.

"STEVE"
Hi.

MEPHESTO
What'd he say?

STAN
He said, "hi."

MEPHESTO
Very interesting.

"STEVE"
Where am I?

MEPHESTO
What??

STAN
He wants to know where he is.

MEPHESTO
Tell him, tell him he's home.

STAN
You're home.

MEPHESTO
In the year 1999.

"STEVE"
It's 1999??

MEPHESTO
He's been frozen for the last 32 months.


STAN
Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.


MEPHESTO
And we found you-

"STEVE"
What? Thirty-two months?!

MEPHESTO
All right, all right, all-

"STEVE"
Aaaa!

MEPHESTO
All right, all right, calm down.

"STEVE"
AAAAAAA!

MEPHESTO
I think that's enough for today.

"STEVE"
Whoa, oh.

KYLE
Good job, dude! You freaked him out!


STAN
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just
jealous 'cause they had me talk to him.


KYLE
Guess what? You're not my best friend
anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!


CARTMAN
Sweet.

STAN
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend
anymore, either! Cartman is now my best
friend!

CARTMAN
Killer.

KYLE
Fine!

STAN
Fine!

CARTMAN
Fine.

[The genetic engineering ranch. A car is stationed outside. A
finger presses the butt-shaped doorbell]

AGENT
Are you Alphonse Mephesto?

MEPHESTO
The same.

AGENT
We understand that you are currently
in possession of the prehistoric ice
man from 1996.

MEPHESTO
That's right.

AGENT
We would like to  we would like to
offer our services in your experiments.


MEPHESTO
Oh? Where are you gents from?

AGENT 2
We are from the University, of America.


MEPHESTO
Well, there's not a lot to see, but
Come in.  He's still not responding
much to us; the shock is still settling
in,  but we've made great progress now
that he's in the habitat.

AGENT
Habitat?

MEPHESTO
Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat
for Steve to live in that is completely
like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.


AGENT
Amazing. He looks so much like us.


MEPHESTO
Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work
in figuring out just how related to
us Steve really is. Hew came up with
this drawing

AGENT
Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific
study is expensive. We want to help
you make this project more lucrative.


MEPHESTO
How would we do that?

AGENT
It's easy.

[Mephesto has opened up his ranch to the public. Viewers move
down a moving sidewalk looking at the habitat and listening to
Ace of Base's "The Sign". One viewer snaps a picture. Mephesto
stands at a podium]

MEPHESTO
As you can see, the ice man is listening
to Ace of Base, which was a very popular
group during his era, and primitive
drummings soothed his people's tempers.


STAN
He doesn't look very happy in there.


KYLE
No, he sure doesn't.

STAN
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I
was talking to Cartman!

KYLE
Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!


CARTMAN
Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of
a sudden.

MEPHESTO
Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to
gain Internet access on the computer.
The Internet was still not very big
in his time, so the Web frightens and
confuses him.  It's okay, he can't hurt
you.  It's one-way glass: he can't even
see us.  And now the ice man watches
television.

AUSSIE
This grizzly bear has the strength of
over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really
pissing him off right now.

MEPHESTO
Wait. This could be dangerous.

AGENT
How so?

MEPEHSTO
He's changing the channel. Something
on the television could frighten and
confuse him.

SPORTS REPORTER
And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons
are going to the Super Bowl!

"STEVE"
What?!! Rrrowrrr!

STAN
You guys aren't being very nice to
my creature.

KYLE
He's my creature!

MEPHESTO
He's fine, boys. And we're learning
so much from him.

STAN
Let him out, dude. He's scared.

AGENT
He would be more scared on the outside.
Do you think this stuff freaks him out?
How do you think he'd react to what's
happening in the government right now?


KYLE
But it isn't right!

AGENT 2
Little boy, sometimes, what's right
isn't as important as what's profitable.


KENNY
(Uh oh. Ow!)

STAN
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

KYLE
What?! I'm not talking to you!

[Later that night.]

STAN
Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?


"STEVE"
Oh hi. What are you doing here? Viewing
hours are 10 to 6.

STAN
I don't think it's fair for them to
keep you captive like this, Gorak. I
came to bust you out.

"STEVE"
Wow. That's really nice of you, kid.
Thanks!

STAN
What are you doing here?

KYLE
I'm here to bust out Steve.

STAN
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out
Gorak.

KYLE
His name is Steve!

STAN
His name is Gorak!

"STEVE"
My name is Larry.

KYLE
Steve!

STAN
Gorak!

KYLE
Steve!

STAN
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!


KYLE
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve
Austin, the $6 million man

STAN
No he doesn't!!

KYLE
Does so!

LARRY
Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the
door so I can get back to my family?


STAN
I found him, I'm rescuing him!

LARRY
Thanks.

STAN
You're a dick!

KYLE
You're a dick!

STAN
You're a dick, and I've had it with
your dicketry! I choose you!

KYLE
You want a fight? Well, that's fine
with me!

STAN
Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!


KYLE
Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?


STAN
Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at
3.

KYLE
Oh yeah.  Fine, I'll kick your ass
tomorrow, dick!

STAN
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish
you never had it- to begin with! Your
ass, I mean.  Wait.

[The town, next day. Larry walks around and comes across "TELE'S,"
which shows a large-screen TV flanked by towers three TV's tall
on each side. Marilyn Manson is on screen]

MARILYN MANSON
I just smelled your britches and they're
stinky

Stinky Britches

Stinky Britches

LARRY
Arrrggh!

[the genetic engineering ranch]

MEPHESTO
He's gone! The ice man has broken out!


AGENT
No, that's impossible! How could he
have?

MEPHESTO
He must have used this door

AGENT
Damn it, Damn it!

MEPHESTO
We have to find him! He won't survive
long out in the world!

AGENT
Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't
be able to use him for our military
war-

AGENT 2
Sshhhh!

AGENT
Right.

MEPHESTO
What?

AGENT 2
What?

AGENT
Nothing.

MEPHESTO
No, what did you say? Uh, use him for
what?

AGENT
Butlutlutlutlup!

AGENT 2
Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature
have gone?

MEPHESTO
I have no idea!

AGENT
We'll never track him down on our own.
This calls for some special assistance.


[Larry knocks at a door at 1299 Waterston St. A woman opens the
door.]

WOMAN
Can I help you?

LARRY
Leslie. It's me, Larry.  Your husband?


WOMAN
Husband? You're not my husband.

LARRY
Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together,
for over eight years?

WOMAN
Iii seem to remember a husband, but
I think he was lost and never found
on Kenosha Pass.

LARRY
That was me!

WOMAN
Oh.

BIG MAN
Who is it, lover?

WOMAN
It's my former husband, who I had forgotten
all about.

BIG MAN
Ooooo.  Well, sir, let me shake your
hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose
wife I'm currently sticking it to every
night.

LARRY
So you remarried.

WOMAN
Yes, Lorry.

LARRY
Larry!

WOMAN
Uhlarry. Larry-y, you disap - peared.
I waited for you to come home for over
three days! I. I remember how cold and
lonely the nights got. By the fourth
day I knew: I had to move on.

LARRY
Didn't anybody send out a search party?


WOMAN
We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon.
But we found nothing, no trace.

LARRY
Please, Leslie, I don't know where else
to go. I'm confused.

WOMAN
Leslie, I'm with Buck now.

LARRY
You're Leslie.

WOMAN
Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children
together.  Calvin is eight, and little
Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave
them. I'm sorry.

LARRY
I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone.
Eight and thirteen?

[Stan's house. He and Cartman are out in the backyard. Cartman
is dressed as an outback hunter]

CARTMAN
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.


STAN
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to
be helping me to get ready to fight
Kyle, not playing Australian outback
guy!

CARTMAN
Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar
bop me in the face and see if it hurts.
Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've
got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!

STAN
You suck as a best friend, Cartman!


CARTMAN
You son of a bitch cat!

STAN
What are you doing, Gorak!

LARRY
I can't live in your time. I'm freezing
myself again.

STAN
Wow, that sucks, dude.

LARRY
Tell me about it. I've been doing this
for over three and a half hours now,
and only my toes are starting to ice
over.

KYLE
Steve, wait!

STAN
What are you doing here, dick?! We're
not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!


KYLE
I've got something to show Steve, dick!


STAN
Gorak is busy freezing himself again,
dick!

KYLE
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself.
Look!

LARRY
What is that?

KYLE
It's this place called Des Moines. It's
like, lost in time, see?  Everybody
looks like you do.  Fashion is two years
behind, Technology is two years behind,
fads, are two years behind, just like
you.

LARRY
Home.

KYLE
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des
Moines!

STAN
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak
is my respnosibility. I'll take him
to Des Moines!

KYLE
No you don't, butthole!

LARRY
They're coming for me!

STAN
Come on!

CARTMAN
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean.
I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.


MEPHESTO
Was the ice man here?

CARTMAN
He might have been, by crikey.

AGENT
We have to get him back. Well, can you
do it?

AUSSIE
Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!


CARTMAN
Wow! Kick ass!

[South Park Train Station. People are waiting to depart, and
a train is pulling in]

STAN
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines,
please.

CLERK
Des Moines? What the hell for?

KYLE
We have to get our friend, Steve-

STAN
My friend, Gorak!

KYLE
-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt
away.

STAN
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's
Frosty, you stupid butthole!

KYLE
Frosty, Steve, whatever.

CLERK
Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat.


STAN
Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.

KYLE
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve.
We have to start fighting now.

LARRY
Okay, boys. Thanks.

KYLE
Okay. First one to die, loses.

STAN
'K.

KYLE
Okay.

STAN
O-okay.

KYLE
So, here we go.

STAN
'K

KYLE
Go.

[The woods. The Aussie leads Mephesto, Agents, Barbrady, and
other cops, in a hunt. He runs across a set of tracks]

AUSSIE
Wait a second.  I think he came through
here recently.

CARTMAN
Yeah, I think the same thing.

AGENT
Well, where the hell is he? We've got
to get him back to the lab.

MEPHESTO
He can't function out here in our time!


AUSSIE
Calm down, calm down.

CARTMAN
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons
of bitches.

AUSSIE
Wait! Look!

MEPHESTO
Is it him?

AUSSIE
No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake.
This is the most poisonous snake in
this entire region.  Now, what I'm gonna
do, is carefully sneak up on him, and
jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey!
Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm
gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now!
Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all
right!

MEPHESTO
Does he always do this?

AGENT
Yeah,

CARTMAN
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's
butthole now.

[the train station. Stan and Kyle are still fighting]

STAN
Ow!

KYLE
Ow!

STAN
Watch my coat, dude.

KYLE
Oh.

LARRY
I got my ticket.

STAN
Huh?

LARRY
I have to go to Platform B.

KYLE
Oh. Okay, it's over this way

AUSSIE
The trail ends here.

AGENT
The train station? Then he's trying
to go somewhere.

MEPHESTO
Have you seen a man who looks similar
to us, but with a thicker brow and an
apish nose?

CLERK
What the hell are you talking about?


MEPHESTO
An ice man, a man from the past. We
must find him. Now, where is he?!


[Platform B. Larry has gotten on the train, and the boys see
him off. They get back to fighting]

LARRY
Well, this is it. I'm going back to
my time. Thanks again, boys.

STAN
No problem, Gorak.

KYLE
Later.

LARRY
You boys have really shown me the true
meanng of friendship. You didn't care
about anythng but my happiness. You
put me in front of yourselves, and that's
what real friendship is all about.


STAN
Yup.

KYLE
Uhuh.

LARRY
After being frozen, I've learned that
all a person has in life is family.
And friends. If you lose those, you
have nothing. So friends are to be treasured,
more than anything in the world!

STAN
Right on.

KYLE
Cool.

LARRY
Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!

MEPHESTO
Where is he? Where is Steve?!

STAN
His name is Gorak!

KYLE
His name is Steve!

AGENT
The train!

MEPHESTO
We've got to stop it!

AUSSIE
No worries.

AGENT
Let's get him!

STAN AND KYLE
No!

[The hunting party is now on the tracks chasing the train.]


AGENT
We've gotta stop that train!

AUSSIE
Come back here, you!

KYLE
Steve! Steve, look out!

STAN
They're after you!

AUSSIE
Oh, he's a wily one!

LARRY
Oh, poo!

KYLE
Steve, look out!

AUSSIE
Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric
man. A sure sign the prey is frightened.
As well as he should be, as I will now
jam my thumb up his butthole.

LARRY
Huh?  Whah?!

AGENT
Stop the train!

CONDUCTOR
Hey, who are you?

AGENT
I said, stop that train!

CONDUCTOR
Yes, hello. I see you.

CARTMAN
They're all movin' pretty fast, but
I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.

[atop the train, Larry and the Aussie wrestle.]

LARRY
I've got you pinned. I win.

AUSSIE
Now I've got you pinned. I win!

CONDUCTOR
Whoa!

AGENT
Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here!
Go get him, boys!  Cut him off!

LARRY
Nooo!

AUSSIE
Now for the coup de gras. I'll just
get my thumb up here.

LARRY
Oohh!

[the helicopter lands in front of the train, but the train rolls
on]

PILOT
Aah, the train's not stopping.  It's
not stopping!  AAAAAAAA!

AUSSIE
Holy bum-!

STAN
Where's Gorak??

PILOT
Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing
I've ever seen.

AGENT
Where's the ice man?!

MEPHESTO
He has to be around here somewhere.


KYLE
I can't believe he's gone.

STAN
Wait, look! The helicopter!

KYLE
Hey!

STAN
He's alive!

LARRY
Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!


MEPHESTO
No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll
never live!

LARRY
I'm not living here! Living is having
ups and downs and sharing them with
friends!  Thank you, Stan and Kyle!
See ya!

AGENT
Damn! Well, so much for our plan to
use the ice man to take over Sweden.


MEPHESTO
What?!

AGENT
What? Nothing!

STAN
Kyle, Steve was a pretty good name
for that guy.

KYLE
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's
original. And besides, you found him.


CARTMAN
Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles,
hahahahahaha.

STAN
Could we be best friends again?  I
hate having Cartman as a best friend.


KYLE
Me, too. He sucks.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys
anyways! You guys can kiss my-  Aha!
There's a king croc right there!  And
what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak
up on it, and jam my thumb in its-


COW
Moo!

CARTMAN
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit!
Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.

Episode 811


"QUEST FOR RATINGS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[An announcer introduces the news over some action-type music]


ANNOUNCER
This is closed-circuit television for
South Park Elementary School. And now,
Super School News. News made for students,
by students.

JIMMY
Welcome to Ssuper School News. I'm Jimmy
Valmer.

CARTMAN
And I'm Rick Cartman.

JIMMY
The price of milk money will go up next
Monday to 49 cents. The school claims
the added money is due to the cow shortage
in South Park County.

CARTMAN
Parent-teacher conferences will be held
this Wednesday night, from seven to
nine. So kids, get a lot of playing
in before you get grounded. And now,
for a look at what's on the menu for
school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.


[Reporting from the cafeteria, Stan.]

STAN
Eric, it looks as though the school
will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now
that's traditionally a uh, a white meat
chicken... breast, if you will, that
has been breaded, and then cooked. I've
been told there will also be tater-tots,
and a vegetable dish. This is really
shaping up to be a ah ah one fantastic
lunch. Eric?

CARTMAN
...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks
a lot. And now, here with the celebrity
watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen
any celebrities?

[Reporting from the sidewalk in front of the school, Butters.]


BUTTERS
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin'
out in front of the school for about
...two hours now ah, and I haven't seen
any celebrities. Uh about thirty minutes
ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver,
but ih ih turn- it turns out it was
a dead horse.

CARTMAN
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.


BUTTERS
Will do.

JIMMY
More snow for South P... p-p Park. Here's
Token Black with the weather.

TOKEN
Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive
snow storm is headed South Park's way.
I asked my dad last night and he said
that he heard the snow storm is expected
on Tuesday. Guys?

CARTMAN
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look
at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball
team just can't get it right.

KYLE
Another devastating loss for the Cows
last night, Eric. They were ahead in
the game until Kelly Anderson crying
because she missed her daddy, who's
on a business trip in Thailand. Uh,
Kelly was so upset she couldn't play,
and the Cows had to forfeit.

CARTMAN
Cows are on a six and O slide since
Kelly's father left for that business
trip.

JIMMY
And that's all for Super School News.
Enjoy your day at South Park Eh- ...eh-
...eh- ...eh-  ehehehehe  eh- ...Elementary.


STAN
And we're cut!

CARTMAN
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice.


BUTTERS
Boy, that was a GREAT episode!

STAN
Yeah, I think that was one of our best
shows yet.

MAN
Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
The school has to cancel your show?


KYLE
What??

JIMMY
For God's sake, Mr. M-m-Meryl?

MR. MERYL
Well, the students just aren't watching
ya. Your rating was only a four this
whole week.

CARTMAN
How many students is that?

MR. MERYL
Four.  Four students watch your show.
And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting
a 57!

STAN
...Craig's show??

CARTMAN
What is that butthole doing now?!

MR. MERYL
O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just
video footage of animals close-up with
a wide angle lens.

CLYDE
Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle
Lens.

STAN
But that's... that's crap! That's not
even TV!

MR. MERYL
It's what the students want, and it's
cheaper to make than yoru show. Just
one person and a video camera. Craig
is a genius. Uh sorry, kids.

JIMMY
But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring
the news to the students. They need
to know the facts, and our news team
them, very much.

MR. MERYL
Kids don't care about the news, boys.
It's boring. Kids wanna see animals,
close-up, with a wide angle lens.


CARTMAN
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is
our life. Withot it, we have nothing.


MR. MERYL
I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud
of what you've done. It's just that
it's kind of gay.

CARTMAN
...You're gay!!

BUTTERS
Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that
new show.

STAN
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard
you work.

WHISTLIN' WILLY
Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'?


CARTMAN
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not
in the mood.

WHISTLIN' WILLY
If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle.
Come on!  There you go!

CARTMAN
God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South
Park!

STAN
Hey look, Craig just walked in.

KID 1
Yeah!

KID 2
Hey look, it's Craig!

KEVIN
Hey, Craig, over here!

KYLE
Geez, and all that from a stupid video
show.

CRAIG
Oh hey guys. Heard about your news
show being cancelled.

CARTMAN
Go play with yourself, Craig.

CRAIG
Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal
with the school, heh. They're paying
me six dollars a week to come up with
new shows.

STAN
Your idea took about this much thought,
Craig!

CRAIG
This much more than you had!  Hey,
a round of root beers for everyone!
On me!

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

CARTMAN
Kenny, what the hell are you doing
with this asshole??

KENNY
(Craig just asked me to do his show,
geez.)

CARTMAN
You're helping Craig make his show?!
I can't believe you would betray us
like that?! We've always been supercool
to you!  Ah whatever, Kenny!

CRAIG
Hey gang, I brought the new episode
of wide angle close-up animals.

CLYDE
Put it, put it up on the, monitors!


KIDS
Cuuute.  Super cuuute.

KYLE
Gah, I just don't get it.

TOKEN
Wow, those animals are pretty cute.


STAN
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked
too hard to just roll over for Craig
and his stupid overall deal. Instead
of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves,
we just need to figure out how to make
our show better!

KYLE
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings
by the end of the week, he'll let us
stay on the air!

BUTTERS
Well, what are we waitin' for?!

STAN
Come on, guys!

[Student Conference Room 1-F, later. Inside, A sign above the
chalkboard reads "Idea Room." Cartman has his feet up on the
table. Stan paces the floor.]

STAN
All right, we all need to come up with
ideas for our show.

KYLE
How about we revamp the name? Super
School News sounds dry.

CARTMAN
It should be Sexy News.

TOKEN
Action News.

STAN
Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.

KYLE
Maybe the problem is we don't have very
good stories to report on.

CARTMAN
Right. We should make up stories, because
they'll be far more interesting.

BUTTERS
Hey, yeah. Uhwhy I could say I saw celebrities
even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie
about what I saw them doing.

CARTMAN
Gosh, Butters, write that down!

BUTTERS
Lie about celebrities.

STAN
We have to appeal to all the students,
so we, we need hot girls for the sixth
graders...

CARTMAN
And panda bears for the preschoolers.


STAN
Good!

KYLE
Maybe we need to make students think
they have to watch our news show or
they'll die.

TOKEN
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports
about how dangerous it is to be alive.


BUTTERS
Oh boy!

JIMMY
Fellas, are you sure all of this ie
eh- ethical?

CARTMAN
We're in fourth grade, Timmy. We don't
even know what ethical means.

STAN
All right, Sexy Action School News Team,
it's time to go to work. Get out there
and get some stories!

BUTTERS
Sexy Action School News Team, ho!


CARTMAN
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with
you?  Look, Token, I, I know the guys
are having trouble bringing this up
with you, but uh... Well the thing is,
Token, we... we really need to revamp
your whole TV persona.

TOKEN
Huh?

CARTMAN
You see Token, people really enjoy seeing
African-Americans on the news... Seeing
African-Americans on the news, not hearing
them. That's why all African-Americans
newspeople learn to talk more... wha,
how should I say... white.  Token, all
the great African-Americans newspeople
have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak
with a more pure Caucasian dialect.
There's no shame in it, and I think
it'll really help our ratings.

[The announcer introduces the show]

ANNOUNCER
This is South Park Elementary School
closed-circuit television. And now,
Time for the Sexy Action School News!!


CARTMAN
Is South Park about to explode from
a methane gas leak? More on that later.
But first, Stan Marsh has a look at
some new outfits for the Raisins girls!


[Reporting from Raisins, Stan Marsh. He's surrounded by Raisins
with shorter shorts and tank tops]

RAISINS GIRLS
Woohoo! Woohoo!

STAN
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier
than before, leaving very little to
the imagination. No doubt that if I
were a little older, I would be aroused.


RAISINS GIRLS
Woowoo!!

CARTMAN
And now, for a look at the weather,
here is Token Black, and Token, I hope
there's no tornadoes headed our way.


TOKEN
No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly
enough, there is a low-pressure storm
moving in over the Park County Valley.
Should bring us some chilly days ahead.


JIMMY
The Park County School Board has approved
a bigger budget for the computer lab
up-

CARTMAN
Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like
Kyle has the jinx on some students'
bathroom habits. Kyle?

KYLE
Eric, sources are speculating that
third-grade student, Pete Thelman ,
pees sitting down like a girl. We've
also got confirmation that Sally Turner
stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has
only one testicle.

CARTMAN
One testicle!  What an asshole!

TOKEN
Uh oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness
Minute!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now,
let's get a look at the celebrity scene
shot, with Butters.

JIMMY
This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr...
travesty.

[Student Conference Room 1-F]

CARTMAN
All right, so after my report on the
unsanitary conditions of the school
cafeteria, we're goin' to Kyle for the
story on Brian Teeves trying to make
out with Susan Farkle.

STAN
Then let's do Token's report on how
global warming is going to kill everyone
in the fifth grade.

TOKEN
That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.


JIMMY
Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news!
The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was
in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview
with him for our news show.

CARTMAN
Oooo, interview with the vice-President,
hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how
we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader
pie-eating and Who's got Skidmark Monday.


JIMMY
But this is real news!

CARTMAN
It's boring news, Jimmy.

JIMMY
How do you know?? You you haven't s-seen
it yet!

CARTMAN
All right, tell me about it.

JIMMY
Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells
me all about how the-

CARTMAN
Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy.
I'm sorry, what were we talking about?


JIMMY
Look, fellas, I've got a real problem
with the direction our news show is
going! We're dumbing down the school!


STAN
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb.
We're just giving them what they want.


KYLE
We're making the news more appealing
to students.

JIMMY
This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized
quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a
journalistic responsibliltiy to bring
students the fa... the facts!  Don't
you see what we've done? In our efforts
to compete with Craig's small-minded
show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews
reporting. I remember when we all made
an oath to each other, way back when
started playing news reporter, that
we would never let anything jeopardize
our integrity! Well our integrity is
jeopardized! And if we can't report
news the honest way, what good is n-news
reporting?

[Mr. Meryl's office, Audio-Visual Department]

MR. MERYL
Boys, first of all, I want to tell you
how impressed I am with your ability
to get more ratings. Your show beat
Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens
by three viewers!

THE BOYS
All right! Woohoo! Awesome!

STAN
I knew we could do it!

KYLE
We beat Close-up Animals!

CARTMAN
Oh man, this is sooo great! We, we worked
so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere
you!

MR. MERYL
Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed
in the ratings by Craig's new show.


STAN
Craig's new show?

MR. MERYL
All the students love it. It's an incredible
idea called Close-up Animals With a
Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take
a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius,
I tell ya. He like... an idea machine.


BUTTERS
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna
get cancelled?

MR. MERYL
I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys.
I'm gonna have to give you all F's in
Extracurricular AV Class. You have to
learn now how important ratings are!


STAN
Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.


MR. MERYL
Yes.  And I guess your best wasn't good
enough .

[In the hall. Mr. Meryl closes the door behnd them.]

STAN
I don't believe it.

CARTMAN
I can't lose this extracurricular credit.
I need it to pass fourth grade!

BUTTERS
Stupid news hair!

JIMMY
Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my
point. We have to elevate our ideas
up, not down.

KYLE
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come
up with way better ideas than Craig.


STAN
Yeah. To save our show, all we need
to do is come up with the best idea
for an episode ever!

[Student Conference Room 1-F. The kid reporters sit around trying
to think of something, anything, but all there is is silence]


KYLE
What if we do a show where we go to-
Uh, no.

CARTMAN
How about we have us, um... hmmm.

STAN
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show
ideas?

BUTTERS
Well how about we get panda bears and
we have them dance around with us.


TOKEN
We did that!

JIMMY
Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.


STAN
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it,
we can do it! Come on!  How about we
do a show with us... ughhh.

KYLE
Thee... uhhh. What if the-?

CARTMAN
Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.

STAN
Crab people?

CARTMAN
They're like half crab, half people,
and they live below the ground.

STAN
Dude, I think we can do a little better
than crab people.

BUTTERS
Hey, I know! We should read the funnies!
I always get good ideas from the funnies.


CARTMAN
Butters, only gay little dweebs read
the funnies!

BUTTERS
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's
one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle,
a-and the other snail says "Well that's
gonna add another hour to his time."
Yeah! You guys!  Heh.

CARTMAN
How about we do a show where we kill
Butters?

BUTTERS
So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing
we're playin' ...uh the back nine at
your house."

STAN
We're hopelessly stuck, completely out
of ideas.

CARTMAN
We have crab people. Just sayin'.

KYLE
Wait! You know what we should do? We
should all take a bunch of cough medicine!


TOKEN
Cough medicine?

KYLE
That's what the sixth graders do behind
the school at recess. They take way
too much cough medicine because they
say it makes them see things in their
heads.

[South Park Pharmacy, later. The boys are at the cold and flu
medicine aisle.]

BUTTERS
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.


KYLE
How do we know which one to use?

STAB
How about this one? Calminex?  "Warning:
Taking more than the recommended amount
can cause severe side effects."

CARTMAN
That sounds perfect.

JIMMY
B-b-bbingo!

PHARMACIST
Can I help you boys?

STAN
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some
ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna
drink a bunch of cough medicine.

PHARMACIST
Whoa, boys! That's not what you need
to come up with ideas.

KYLE
It's not?

PHARMACIST
No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It
has the dexatrimfan in it that causes
hallucinations in large doses.

KYLE
Oh, okay.

PHARMACIST
Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy
kind of high you're looking for, I do
also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu.
Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin
Cough and Cold, but of course, that's
only if you really want to trip balls.


JIMMY
Wha, what do you think, fellas?

STAN
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.


PHARMACIST
That's the spirit! All right, boys,
I'll just need your parents' permission.
Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs.
Come on over to the register.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, looks like somebody else is doin'
a little partyin' tonight.

MR. SLAVE
Oh, Jezuth Christh

BUTTERS
Woo. We aren't havin' a party.

MR. GARRISON
Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that
for your bad coughs, right?  Us too.


MR. SLAVE
Jezuth.

[Student Conference Room 1-F. Butters and Jimmy sit at a sofa.
Jimmy has set his crutches aside and is now drinking the cough
syrup]

KYLE
All right, now everybody take a tablet
and a pencil.  and when all the ideas
start coming, just write 'em down. We
might not remember everything otherwise.


BUTTERS
Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative
and smart.  Hohhh, it's all think and
g-gooey.

CARTMAN
Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.

KYLE
Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?

JIMMY
I think maybe he's f-feeling it.

CARTMAN
Stan, are you getting good ideas?


BUTTERS
Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish,
fellas.

[Stan begins his head trip. He sees a tunnel with yellow light,
then a flash of plasma, then an aminated Mandelbrot design, then
a prize-winning dog on a pedestal. A bell sounds. Next, a tunnel
with blue light, which ends up at a performance of some sort,
a time-lapse shot of rolling clouds, another Mandelbrot animation,
a running shot of a meadow, then a wide-angle view of the boys]


CARTMAN
Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go
find a frog.

[Stan then sees time-lapse footage of a ride through a city,
then blooming flowers, then time-lapse footage of the reporters
walking around the valley, then some weird graphics, then Cartman
in degraded colors. Cartman and Stan speak to him in weird altered
voices]

CARTMAN
Oh Stan, I just got the best idea

KYLE
Me too.

[Stan then sees an imploding building, then some dancing African
women, an explosion in another building, a zoom-pan shot of an
African dancer. Next he sees himself and the boys on a sidewalk
in downtown. Butters talks to him in the same altered voice the
other voice have spoken to him in]

BUTTERS
Hey! Let's run naked through the street!


[Student Conference Room 1-F, later on. Token and Jimmy are in
amchairs, Stan stayed on the floor, Kyle, Butters, and Cartman
are on the sofa. Butters is in his underwear. All of them are
groggy]

CARTMAN
Dude, this TV show is awesome.

STAN
It's... 's the greatest show of all
time.

KYLE
I could watch this for days.

THE BOYS
Cuuute. Super cuuute.

[Student Conference Room 1-F, next morning. The boys are now
asleep. Butters' head is on Kyle's lap. Stan, sleeping on the
floor, wakes up and looks around]

STAN
You guys. You guys, wake up!

KYLE
Ah!

BUTTERS
Huh?

KYLE
Butters, get away from me!

BUTTERS
Oh Jesus, where are my clothes??

STAN
We took a bunch of cough medicine to
come up with ideas for our show. I didn't
come up with anything.

CARTMAN
Ah I did. I wrote something down.  Here
it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle.


KYLE
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the
Happy Days theme song.

STAN
You guys, we watched Craig's show all
night long.

TOKEN
Yeah. It was great.

STAN
No, but don't you see? We didn't think
it was great before. I think I understand
now.  I think I know why Craig's show
gets such great ratings! Half the school
is high on cough medicine!

KYLE
Jesus, you may be right.

JIMMY
Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone
get your hair looking as fantastic as
possible. It's time for us to do the
most incredible investigative news report
of our journalistic lives!

[An announcer introduces the news over some action-type music]


ANNOUNCER
This is closed-circuit television for
South Park Elementary School. And now,
a Sexy Action News Team Special Report:
Cough Medicine Abuse in School!  With
the Sexy Action School News Team!  It's
the report you can't afford to miss!
And now here's Rick Cartman!

CARTMAN
They call it cough syrup, cough medicine,
cold and flu remiedy. But behind closed
doors at South Park Elementary it also
has a street name. Hoochie, wombat juice,
tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman.
Today, the Sexy Action School News Team
takes you inside the dark and lonely
world... of cough medicine abuse.


STAN
They're doing it in the hallways!
Behind the school!

RED-HAIRED GOTH
Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork!


STAN
Even in the girls' bathroom!

BEBE
Is somebody in there? I'll tell on
you!

STAN
We showed the shocking footage to the
principal!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh my goodness!

JIMMY
P- Principal Victoria, can you explain
how your administration fuh-failed to
see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well I... we...

KYLE
So where are students getting all this
cough medicine??  This surveillance
footage shows a group of troubled kids
getting all the smack they want from
a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News
reported the pharmacist to the South
Park police, and he was immediately
arrested!

TOKEN
The cough companies claim they don't
intend for their product to be used
by kids to get high! But one look at
the packaging tells otherwise.  Theradryl
DM. For kids.  Dexa Cough, children's
formula.

CARTMAN
And now, for a quick celebrity check,
here's Butters Stotch.

BUTTERS
Still no celebrities, Eric. Uhn, I'll
keep my eyes open.

STAN
The cough medicine problem used to also
run rampant in neighboring Middle Park
Elementary. But they took action: ridded
their entire town of cough medicine,
and what we see now is a happier school,
100% cough medicine-free.

[Mr. Meryl's office, later.]

MR. MERYL
Boys, I want to congratulate you on
what is perhaps the finest piece of
student television I've ever seen. Not
only did you get all the students and
myself off of couch medicine, but you
got a 22 in the ratings!

KYLE
Twenty-two people?? All right!

CRAIG
You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?

MR. MERYL
Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings
for your show are down significantly.


STAN
Gee, what a concidence.

JIMMY
I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?

MR. MERYL
You need to know how important ratings
are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend
you from school and request that you
have your testicles removed surgically.


CARTMAN
Haha! In your face, Craig!

MR. MERYL
You boys are approved for twenty-seven
new shows. I want you to come up with
an even better idea than the cough medicine
story. Get to it!

[Student Conference Room 1-F, later on. The boys are seated at
the table once again, sitting in silence]

STAN
Nobody has any ideas?

CARTMAN
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin'
to come up with ideas for shows all
the time. It hurts my head.

KYLE
Dude, bail?

CARTMAN
...I think bail.

STAN
...Bail.

JIMMY
Yep, b-b-b-bail.

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 714


"RAISINS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary playrgound, recess or lunch. The camera
pans across the playground and settles on two teams of seven
players each. A football lies on the ground between the two groups.
The group left of the football consists of Stan, Kyle, Cartman,
Kenny, Butters, Token, and Clyde. The second includes Craig,
Tweek, Kevin, Pip, and three others]

STAN
All right, you guys, it's first down.
I'll hike the ball on the third "set
hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post
out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle.
Butters, be ready for the screen.


CARTMAN
Right. What are we playing again?

STAN
Football.

CARTMAN
Got it.

STAN
Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut!


BEBE
Wendy breaks up.

STAN
What?

BEBE
Wendy breaks up with you.

STAN
Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I
do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy
for weeks.

BEBE
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore.
She said she still wants to be friends.


CARTMAN
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares!
Just get out of our football game, you
stupid skank!

BEBE
Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!


BUTTERS
Oh yeah? Huwell, at least we have assholes,
you dumb girl!

CARTMAN
Yeh-heah, right!

BEBE
God, you're so stupid!

CARTMAN
What a whore!

KYLE
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy
breaks up!  Stan?

CARTMAN
Come on, Stan, it's first down still.


[Stan is next seen walking onto a small red stone bridge. The
next scene has him walking down the middle of a two-lane road
in the rain. He stops to take in the moist air. The next scene
has him back on the bridge, looking over the creek with his head
on his right hand. On the water he sees a reflection of Wendy
walk up to him. She's smiling. He brightens as she approaches.
He turns to greet her, but there's no one to greet. He looks
back at the creek, then turns around and walks off. The next
scene has him at a rainy night sitting on the curb in a run-down
part of town, under a working street light, with his face buried
in his legs, crying. The last scene has him in his room, sitting
on the floor by his bed, looking at a picture of Wendy. He gently
strokes the picture, which has Wendy holding a daisy and smiling
broadly. On the picture are written the words "I love you forever.
Wendy." The image fades to black]

[South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway Craig goes to a drinking
fountain for a drink of water. Fosse and Dog Poo walk towards
the camera. Stan is at the far end watching Wendy open her locker.
Stan looks away and walks towards Kyle, who's seated next to
his locker reading a book.]

STAN
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?


KYLE
Why?

STAN
'Cause I need to know why she broke
up.

KYLE
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science
homework.

STAN
Dude, please. I might still have a
chance to make things work. Please,
just go talk to her?

KYLE
God damnit!  Wendy, Stan wants to know
why you break up.

WENDY
Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't
wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
I've been wanting to break up for a
while. but it's, it's nothing against
him.

KYLE
'K.  She says she's been wantin' to
break up for a while, and it's nothing
against you.

STAN
What? That's no answer!  Go tell her
to be more direct with me.

KYLE
No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself.
Be poetic.

STAN
Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!

JIMMY
Hey Stan.

STAN
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for
me?

JIMMY
For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?

STAN
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic.
Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,
tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source
of inspiration to me.

JIMMY
She's what?

STAN
She's a continuing source of inspiration
to me.

JIMMY
...Okay.  Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wemdy.


WENDY
Yeah?

JIMMY
Stan says your a cont... you're a- cont-
S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-

WENDY
Well tell Stan to stop!!

JIMMY
-cont- You're a cont-tinuing source
of inspiration to him.

STAN
Well?

JIMMY
She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're
gonna have to face facts. It's over.


STAN
Over?  Jesus...

BUTTERS
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!


STAN
...Go away.

KYLE
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself.
You have to go live.

STAN
Why? What's the point of living when
the only girl I ever loved is gone?


CARTMAN
God, what a fag!

KYLE
Dude, not now!

STAN
You guys have no idea how this feels.
It's like, you always hear songs about
a broken heart and you think it's just
a figure of speech? But it's true. My
chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking
feeling where my heart is. It's broken...


KYLE
Jeez, he's worse than I thought.

BUTTERS
Well what do we do now?

JIMMY
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic
joke?

KYLE
No. We just have to show him that there's
other girls out there. I say we take
him to Raisins.

BUTTERS
What's Raisins?

[Next day, Raisins, a Hooters-like restaurant with al-fresco
dining. The boys enter the restaurant, and a pretty little girl
in a Raisins outfit walks up. Other girls walk around, all seem
to work there]

BLONDE
Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of
you?  Right over here.

REDHEAD
So you guys having a good time today?


DINERS
Uh huh...

BLONDE 2
How about some more fun fries, guys?


DINERS
Okay...

BRUNETTE
Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone
here is such a loser, but you guys seem
really cool.

BLONDE
Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right
with you.

KYLE
What do you think, Stan. These girls
are pretty cute, huh?

JIMMY
Jesus Christ, I think I've died and...
gone to... heaven.

BUTTERS
This place is awesome!

CARTMAN
How do you know? We haven't even tried
the food yet.

LEXUS
Hey guys.

BUTTERS
Whoa!

LEXUS
How are we doing this afternoon?

THE BOYS
Good.

LEXUS
I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone
here is such a loser, but you guys seem
really cool.

BUTTERS
W-we are.

LEXUS
So what can I get you?

CARTMAN
Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy
tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts
and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas,
and a pitcher of lemonade.

LEXUS
Great. I'll put your order in right
now.

BUTTERS
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes
me. She, she touched my back when she
walked away. Did you see that?

LEXUS
Raisins, girls!

BLONDE 3
Woohoo!

REDHEAD
Oh Yeah!

BRUNETTE 2
Do it!

KYLE
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That
Raisins girl is really cure, huh?  Why
don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me?


BRUNETTE 3
Hi guys. My name's Porsche.

KYLE
Hey. Uh, this is Stan.

PORSCHE
Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your
hat. I used to have a hat juuust like
that, except, it was black and it didn't
have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my
hands are sooo cold. How come people
have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder
that?

[Some time later, still dining. The Village People's "YMCA" begins
to play, and some Raisins girls begin to dance]

RAISINS GIRLS
YMCA...  YMCA-A.

CARTMAN
Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest
place in the world...

PORSCHE
Have you ever noticed how much sand
there is at the beach? I mean, haven't
you ever wondered where all this sand
came from? Omigod, this one time, I
saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!


STAN
Can we go, please?

KYLE
Okay. Okay, come on you guys.

PORSCHE
Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much
for coming to Raisins!

LEXUS
Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?

BUTTERS
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my
stupid friends wanna go.

LEXUS
Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see
you again??

BUTTERS
When do you wanna see me?

LEXUS
As soon as possible!

BUTTERS
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already,
but here is another five dollars.


LEXUS
Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here,
youuu!

BUTTERS
Waa... ahaaah...

RAISINS GIRL
Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!


JIMMY
Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better
now?

STAN
No, dude, I feel worse!

KYLE
Look, we're just trying to show you
there's other girls out there.

STAN
Dude, I don't have time to start over
with other girls. I'm nine years old,
dude! If I don't work things out with
Wnedy, I could be alone my whole life!


BUTTERS
She wants to see me again! My Raisins
girl said she wants to see me again!


STAN
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time
I've been having my friends do all thealking
for me. It's time I took control!


KYLE
What are you doing?

STAN
Something I should have done a long
time ago.

[Bebe's house, night. Stan walks towards the fromt door, looks
around, and knocks three times. No response, so he knocks again.
The door opens and Bebe appears]

STAN
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for
me right now!  All this time I've been
trying to have my friends do all the
talking for me! Now I realize I need
her friends to do it! Tell her I love
her!

BEBE
Stan, why don't you show her you love
her? If you really want Wendy back,
try doing the most romantic thing you
can think of.

STAN
Okay, so what's the most romantic thing
I can think of?

BEBE
If you really want a shot at getting
her back, stand outside her window,
hold a boombox over your head, and play
Peter Gabriel.

[Wendy's house, night. Stan stands on the lawn with a boombox,
looking up at Wendy's window. He presses the play button and
holds up the boombox. Peter Gabriel's "Shock the Monkey" plays
from somewhere in the middle. Wendy appears at the window and
looks down, her jaw dropping. Stan holds the boombox higher,
keeping Wendy's gaze on him. Wendy covers her mouth as Token
appears next to her at the window. Stan's jaw drops. Wendy leaves
the window. Token unleashes the curtain ties, and the curtains
close upon the window]

[Raisins, night, outside. The outside lights turn off. Butters
waits outside on the curb with a present. The front door opens
and Lexus appears. Butters rises to greet her]

LEXUS
Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye,
Mercedes.

BUTTERS
Lexus!

LEXUS
Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie.

BUTTERS
I waited all night for you to get off
work.

LEXUS
Oh, really?  Huhunh, that's great. Uhm,
Maury...

BUTTERS
I I just could- I just couldn't stop
thinking about you.

MAURY
There a problem?

LEXUS
Could you uh just help walk me to my-
bike?

MAURY
Right.

LEXUS
Thanks again for the big tip. You are
such a sweetie. Come back and see me
real soon, okay?

BUTTERS
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot.
Ah I got you this present.

LEXUS
Oh wow. Thanks, cutie.

BUTTERS
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as
a rabbit.

LEXUS
Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten
all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta
go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins
and see me again, okaaay?

BUTTERS
Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus?
Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking
that we should- go do something sometime.


LEXUS
Oh gee, that would be great, honey,
but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell
you what: you come back to Raisins and
then we'll be able to hang out all we
want, okay?

BUTTERS
O-kay!

LEXUS
Bye, cutie!

BUTTERS
Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life
relationship.

[South Park Elementary, day. All the boys are in various stages
of dress. Most of them are in their P.E. uniforms]

MR. GARRISON
All right, kids! Out on the gym floor
for P.E. class.

KYLE
Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.


STAN
I can't believe it. She's in love with
somebody else.

KYLE
Dude, you need to snap out of this!
So Wendy left you for Token. What are
you gonna do? Just be miserable your
whole life?

STAN
There's nothing else I can do. She was
my whole life.

KYLE
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for
the last four days is mope around! You
might as well hang out with those Goth
kids who dress in black and talk about
pain all the time!

STAN
Maybe I should. At least they will understand
me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth
kids.

[South Park Elementary, loading bay. Stan finds the boys]

GOTH 1
Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're
all taught to believe in happy fairytale
endings.  But there's only blackness.
Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats
at your soul.

GOTH 2
Who needs that kind of Barbie love,
anyway? Everyone's just walking around
like a bunch of conforminsts. Go ahead
and wear your business suits so you
can make thirty-four thousand dollars
a year to buy your condominium. They're
all zombies racing to their graves.
Love didn't work for my mom and dad.
Why should it work for me?

GOTH GIRL
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard
doesn't even know I exist. But then
he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy
concert because my heroine-addict aunt
is coming over for dinner.  Dinner?
That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my
mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly
clothes like all the Britney Spears
wannabes at this school.

LITTLE GOTH
They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists
cheerleaders.

STAN
But if life is only pain, then... what's
the point of living?

GOTH 1
Just to make life more miserable for
the conformists.

STAN
All right, so how do I join you?

GOTH 2
If you wanna be one of the non-conformists,
all you have to do is dress just like
us and listen to the same music we do.


STAN
...'K.

[Raisins, day. Raisins is preparing for a new day of food and
fun. Mercedes escorts a new employee around]

MERCEDES
Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari,
so I wanna go over the basics with you.


FERRARI
Okay.

MERCEDES
First of all, there's a five foot rule.
If you come within five feet of a customer,
you need to acknowledge them, even if
they're not at your table. "Hey, cudie."
When you're not serving food or talking
with customers, you need to dance around
and have fun.  We use things like Hula
Hoops, silly strings, and water guns
to play with the other girls. Be sure
to giggle a lot, and be sure to show
off your raisins.  Now, when you take
a customer's order, you need to sit
down at the table with them and make
them think you're interested. Write
your name down for them and make them
feel special. "Oh man, I am so bored.
Thank God you guys came in." If you
want good tips, the most important thing
is physical contact. Just a simple hold
of the arm can mean the difference between
five and twenty dollars. "I'll be right
back with your order, guys."

FERRARI
Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.

MERCEDES
Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open
for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and
open for business, Porsche!

PORSCHE
Okay!

RAISINS GIRL
Hi, welcome to Raisins!

BUTTERS
Hi! Is Lexus here?

LEXUS
Hey, cutie.

BUTTERS
Darling!

LEXUS
How are we doing today?

BUTTERS
Oh God. I missed you so much.

[The Goth girl's room. It's quite the room, with posters for
Happy Puppy and the Nothing Matters tour, a Blauhaus poster,
candles all around, a mace on the floor, cigarettes next to a
book, an ornate candelabrum and chair, and a darkened atmosphere.]


GOTH GIRL

Shallow life.

Drowning alone, I gasp for air.

Coldness creeps over pale skin.

There is sadness so deep it pulls me down

Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.

GOTH 1
Yeah, happiness dies.

STAN
Yeah.

GOTH 2
All right, your turn, Stan. Read one
of your poems about pain.

STAN


There is darkness all around me

Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe

My heart has been raped.

GOTH GIRL
Whoa.

STAN
The pain is everlasting.

I miss you so much, babe.

Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.

Want to-

GOTH 1
Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines
aren't Goth!

STAN
They're not?

GOTH 2
No, dude! You can't say "I miss you
so much, babe. I want to hold you in
my arms."

GOTH GIRL
Make it "I miss seeing you so much I
wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."


GOTH GIRL'S MOM
Henrietta! Hi sweetie!

HENRIETTA
Go away Mom! Leave me alone!

HENRIETTA'S MOM
Daddy and I just got your birthday present!
But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!


HENRIETTA
You'd like to wait till I was dead,
wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots
eat my face.

HENRIETTA'S MOM
Ee-you are so creative, honey.

HENRIETTA
Conformist bitch.

OTHER GOTHS
Yeah.

[Raisins, day. Two of the Raisins girls are entertaining the
child customers, who respond enthusiatically. The phone rings
and Porsche arrives to answer it.]

PORSCHE
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is
Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy
Wings?

BUTTERS
Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is
her boyfriend.

LEXUS
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is
Lexus.

BUTTERS
Hey Lexus.

LEXUS
Hi, sweetie! Who's this?

BUTTERS
Wuh it's me, Butters.

LEXUS
Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.
So how are you, honey?

BUTTERS
I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah,
school was pretty tough today. We had
two quizzes, and one of them was a pop
quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes
are too hard.  But I thought about you
all day long. I promise. So how is your
day going?

LEXUS
Good, good.

BUTTERS
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight
you could come over and we could watch
The Exorcist on DVD.

LEXUS
Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't
you just come down to Raisins?

BUTTERS
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money
left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins
the last six times.

LEXUS
Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really
wanna see you.

BUTTERS
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby.
Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more
money

LEXUS
'K sugar. Gotta run.

BUTTERS
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's
something I've been meaning to say.
Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe
I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want
to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh,
Oh my God.

[Butters' house, living room. Butters arrives there moments later
and faces the couch]

BUTTERS
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance
again.

STEPHEN
O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance
two days ago.

BUTTERS
Uh but I spent it all.

LINDA
What are you spending all that money
on, Butters?

BUTTERS
On my girlfriend.

STEPHEN
Girlfriend?

LINDA
You... have a girlfriend, Butters?


BUTTERS
Yeah.

CHRIS
And she's... a... girl, right?

BUTTERS
Yup!

CHRIS
Well all right! Good for you, Butters!


LINDA
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get
to meet her?

BUTTERS
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right
now. You can come alone.  But don't
embarass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll
be real nervous to impress you.

STEPHEN
Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna
say hi and then we'll leave you two
alone.

BUTTERS
Okay.

STEPHEN
You see? I told you he wouldn't turn
out gay.

LINDA
All right, you win.

[Benny's, night. "We're always open." The Goth kids are seated
at a booth drinking coffee. A middle-aged waitress walks by with
a pot of coffee]

GOTH 2
Hey, can we get more coffee over here?


WAITRESS
Damnit, are you kids just gonna sit
here all night again and drink six dollars'
work of coffee?! Why don't you get a
life?!

GOTH 2
Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race
life, living paycheck to paycheck for
corporate gains.

OTHER GOTHS
Yeah.

GOTH 1
Dude, you haven't drank your coffee.


STAN
Well I don't drink coffee.

GOTH 1
You can't be a non-conformist if you
don't drink coffee.

KYLE
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to
believe it! What the hell are you doing?!


STAN
Breathing deep in darkness that envelops
my soul.

KYLE
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want
you to come home!

STAN
So they can fill my head with more Disney
lies about how perfect the world is?
I don't think so.

GOTH 1
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to
your Justin Timberlake and your homework,
you conformist asshole?  You just don't
know what real pain is.

KYLE
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try
living in a Third-World country, you
little pussy!

GOTH 1
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World
country with all the conforminsts.


KYLE
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling
sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone
cares about you and everyone wants you
back!

STAN
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with
Token?

KYLE
Yeah. She is.

STAN
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh.
Because I don't care about them. What's
the point of caring if all it brings
is pain?

HENRIETTA
For sure.

KYLE
Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun
being miserable.

STAN
...conformist.

OTHER GOTHS
Yeah.

[Raisins, night. Butters and his parents arrive.]

BUTTERS
Here we are, Mom and Dad!

MERCEDES
Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?


BUTTERS
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend.
I brought my parents over to meet her.


MERCEDES
Great.  Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers.
Right this way.

RAISINS GIRL
Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls
calendar for five dollars?

DINERS
Woohoo, all right, yeah!

LINDA
Stephen, what is this place?

STEPHEN
I, don't know.

MERCEDES
Here you go. Porsche will by right
with you.

BUTTERS
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've
gotta go and find Lexus!

RAISINS GIRL
Hey cutie, you having a good time?


BOY
Yeah.

STEPHEN
Oh boy, I think I know what's happened.
Our son hasn't learned yet that girls
will pretend to like him for money.


LINDA
This place is horrible. To objectify
girls like this.

PORSCHE
Hi guys. Can I take your order?

LINDA
Little girl, you shouldn't be working
here.

PORSCHE
I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be
working?

LINDA
No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere
where you're paid for how you look.
You should be learning a skill so you
can grow up to be a businesswoman or
even a doctor. Who knows? You could
cure cancer.

PORSCHE
I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would
be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on
my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.


LINDA
... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins
might be the perfect place for you.


PORSCHE
Cool!

BUTTERS
Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.

LEXUS
Hi. Welcome to Raisins.

STEPHEN
Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk
with you? Outside?

BUTTERS
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to
me  you can say in front of Lexus.


LINDA
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested
in you because they know you'll give
them tips.

BUTTERS
Huh?

STEPHEN
You see, Butters, women know that they
can make men do anything by flirting.
And some girls, like these, turn that
into a profession.

BUTTERS
Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my
girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin',
Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as
a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked
against us, but we're gonna give it
our best shot! And so, if you can't
be happy for us, y-you can just go to
heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus.
I'm movin' out of my parents' house
and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's
blow this joint!

LEXUS
What are you talking about, kid? We
are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.


BUTTERS
... What? Lexus, what are you saying?
Are you saying... you don't want to
be together anymore?

LEXUS
I'm sorry, sweetie.

BUTTERS
So that's it? We're broken up now?


LEXUS
I gotta get these curly fries to Table
12.

BUTTERS
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't
say anything more. There's nothing left
to say. It's over.  Our relationship
is o-over.

[Run-down part of town, night. The conditions surrounding Stan's
presence there a week ago are present again, and Butters sobs
at the same spot Stan did, at the curb under a working street
light. Some shadows move in on him and stop when they cover most
of his head]

GOTH VOICE
Look at this. Another tortured soul.
Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check
it out.

STAN
Butters?

BUTTERS
Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.

STAN
What's the matter with you?

BUTTERS
Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up
with me.

HENRIETTA
Did she step on your heart with stiletto
heels?

BUTTERS
Yeah.  It sure does hurt.

GOTH 2
That's cool. I guess you can join up
with us if you want.

GOTH 1
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard
and write poems about death and how
pointless life is.

BUTTERS
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.

STAN
Huh? But you just got dumped

BUTTERS
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the
same time I'm really happy that somethin'
could make me feel that sad. It's like,
ih ih, ih it makes me feel alive, you
know? It makes me feel human. And the
only way I could feel this sad now is
if I felt somethin' really good before.
So I have to take the bad with the good,
so I guess what I'm feelin' is like
a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds
stupid...

GOTH 1
Yeah.

STAN
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound
stupid at all.

BUTTERS
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me
in your clique, guys, uh but, to be
honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little
pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see
ya, Stan.

STAN
He's right. I don't even know who I
am anymore. I like liking life a whole
lot more than hating it. Screw you guys,
I'm goin' home.

GOTH 2
Go ahead and go back to your sunshine
fairytale!

[South Park Elementary, playground. The school kids are back
at play. The same two teams face off, except that Bill has replaced
Token on Stan's team, and Stan hasn't arrived yet]

KYLE
Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody
make a play!

STAN
Hey, can I join in?

KYLE
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing
in pain?

STAN
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I
just realized that there's gonna be
a lot of painful times in life, so,
I'd better learn to deal with it the
right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch.
Token?  Right here, buddy.

KYLE
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have
you back.

STAN
Yeah. Let's play ball.

THE END

"BUTTERS' VERY OWN EPISODE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Butters' home, night. Butters enters the living room with a
gift in hand. He walks up to his parents. His mom is polishing
an end table while his father reads the newspaper on the sofa
beside it.]

BUTTERS
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin'
Dad's anniversary present for ya.


DAD
Oh, is it soneone's anniversary soon?


MOM
Oh, you!

DAD
Just kidding.  Oh, I wonder what it
is.

BUTTERS
It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell
you. Uh but it's really nifty.

DAD
Well, looks like we're gonna have to
do somethin' extra-special for Mommy
and Daddy's anniversary this year. How
about on Saturday we all go have dinner
at Bennigan's!

BUTTERS
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??
Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm goona get
the Rain Champ baby-back ribs!

MOM
Calm down there, cowboy. You've still
got four days.

BUTTERS
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm
gonna wait that long!

CHOIR
Who's the boy who can laugh at a storm
cloud?

Turn a frown into a smile for free?

Who's the kid with the heart full of magic?

Everyone know it's Butters!

['It's "The Butters Show"' appears over a wallpaper design of
Butters' head. This is the show's splash screen]

BUTTERS
That's me.

[NEXT SCENES

CHOIR
Who's the boy with the eyes full of
wonder?

Thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?

Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?

Everyone know it's Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me.

[NEXT SCENES
Butters jumps into a puddle. Butters
runs down the hall to the theater proper.
Butters petting a white goat. Butters
holds a picture of himself and John
Elway. Butters talking in the playground,
holding his tooth. Kyle finds Butters

CHOIR
Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the

Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway.

Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,

Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?

If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you
find

A little boy named Butters!

BUTTERS
Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .

[Return to Butters' living room. His mom is dusting off a portrait
on the wall as his dad returns to reading the newspaper]

BUTTERS
Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's.
That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.


DAD
Well, if you two will excuse me, I
need to go and buy a certain special
lady her anniversary present.

MOM
I hope he means me, haha.

BUTTERS
Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means
you.

DAD
I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters,
you're in charge of the house.

BUTTERS
Yes sir!

MOM
Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me
this year?

BUTTERS
We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.


MOM
Every year it's the same. Your father
gets me some great gift and my gift
to him falls short.  I've just got to
outdo him this year, I've just got to.


BUTTERS
Dad's a good shopper all right.

MOM
Butters, maybe you could secretly follow
your dad and see what he's getting me.


BUTTERS
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't
that kind of like... fibbin'?

MOM
No, it's a little different. You remember
when the nice policeman gave yuu a badge
and made you an honorary inspector?


BUTTERS
Sure I do!

MOM
Why, I think Inspector Butters could
find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy
without him ever knowing.  What do you
say?

BUTTERS
Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am!


["The Butters Show" splash screen, but now only "Butters" is
on the screen.]

CHOIR
Everyone know it's Butters!

BUTTERS
Uh, that's me!

[South Park, night, the seedy side of town. Butter's father walks
down the street and stops at a corner. He sees a pawn shop across
the street and walks towards it. He turns and faces the street
for a few seconds, then puts on a hat and turns up the collar
on his shirt. He walks back the way he came. Butters has arrived
and sees him from behind a bush across the street. Butters has
on his own disguise - a handlebar mustache - and carries a note
pad, on which he takes notes of his father's every move. He pops
out from behind the bush. His father looks around to make sure
no one is following and arrives at Studcat Theater to see "Fisting
Firemen 9." He looks around as he enters, and the doors close
behind him]

BUTTERS
Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How
nice.

[Butters' father soon leaves the theater and walks towards a
men's bath house, the White Swallow Spa. He arrives and rings
the doorbell. He looks around both ways and enters as soon as
the buzzer sounds. Butters looks on from behind a trash can across
the street]

BUTTERS
"White Swallow Bath House"

["The Butters Show" splash screen]

CHOIR
Everyone know it's Butters!

BUTTERS
Uh, that's me!

[Butters' hosue, night. He's returned from his tour of espionage
and finds his mother in the kitchen cutting carrots into slices]


BUTTERS
I'm back, Ma!

MOM
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow
your dad around?

BUTTERS
I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night
out.

MOM
Well, did you see what he got me for
our anniversary?

BUTTERS
Well first, he went to see a movie.


MOM
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna
see a movie by himself.

BUTTERS
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie
theater at the mall. No, it was that,
really old theater downtown. The Studcat.
I didn't know it was open.

MOM
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?


BUTTERS
"Fisting Firemen 9"  I've never seen
1 through 8.

MOM
Oh my God...

BUTTERS
Uh but it must have been a real short
movie, though, because Dad came out,
like, ten minutes later. ...And it must
have been a sad film, too, because,
he had a bunch of tissue paper with
him when he came out. Poor old Dad,
the movie really got to him.

MOM
Butters, where did Daddy go after the
movie?

BUTTERS
To the gym.

MOM
To the gym.

BUTTERS
Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.

MOM
Gaah!

BUTTERS
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with
all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good,
though. This one black guy had him pinned
down for firteen minutes straight!


MOM
...Butters? Are you sure about this?
You have to be absolutely sure!

BUTTERS
Inspector Butters gets all the facts.
I even got some neato pictures.  The
only thing I can't figure out is why
dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for
yoru present when he was goin' out to
see the movies an' wrestlin'.  Oh, did
you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you
next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?

["The Butters Show" splash screen]

CHOIR
...Butters!

BUTTERS
Uh, that's me!

[Butters' house, day. He's working with Lego blocks at the coffee
table while his mom works on the wall behind him, painting over
one shade of green with a lighter shade. Her hair is a mess.]


MOM
Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean.
Paaiint.

DAD
Well, honey, you've painted the entire
house. Three times.

MOM
Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything
new!

DAD
Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble
finding an anniversary present for Mom.
Any ideas?

BUTTERS
Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.

DAD
Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have
to go out shopping again.

MOM
Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything
new. Paaiint.

DAD
I'll be back in a little while.

BUTTERS
Should I go see what he gets you again,
Mom?

MOM
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think
Daddy's going out wrestling again.
Paaiint.  Paaiint.  Must be made clean.
New.

BUTTERS
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what
Dad could get Mom for their anniversary.
I gotta go tell him.

MOM
Must clean Butters.  Clean. Never be
clean. Must...  kill? The only way?
Must kill Butters.  Paaiint.

["The Butters Show" splash screen]

CHOIR
...Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[The White Swallow Spa, night. Butters is at its front doors
and rings the buzzer. The doors open and he enters He jumps up
and gives the attendant some money - $10.]

BUTTERS
One please.

ATTENDANT
Locker two thirteen!

BUTTERS
Uh thanks!

[The locker room. The camera pans across the locker room and
shows nothing but men in towels. Some of them are exercising,
others just chat.]

BUTTERS
Dad?  Dad, you in here?

[A hallway. Butters happens upon a wooden door with a small window
in the upper half. He looks up at the window, then enters the
room.]

BUTTERS
Hello? Eh-anybody in here?

MAN 1
There, do you think that works?

MR. GARRISON
Well, that's four fingers; try five.


BUTTERS
Uh Mr. Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
...Who is that?!

[The main hallway. Butters enters and checks the first door to

BUTTERS
Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in
here?  Dad?

MAN 2
This room's taken.

BUTTERS
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  ndad? No.
Hm.

DAD
OOH! BUTTERS!!

BUTTERS
Hi Dad!

DAD
Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!

BUTTERS
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know
the perfect anniversary present for
Mom. But what are you doin' with your
weiner out there, Dad?

DAD
Butters, you need... to leave here
right now! You need to... get out of
here, egeh... Go home and wait for me
to talk to talk to you.

BUTTERS
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya
at home.

DAD
Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?

CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[Butters' house, night. Butters' dad is in his study.]

DAD
Butters!  Oh Butters! Could you come
and see me in my study real quick?


BUTTERS
Uh, hey Dad.

DAD
Come here, son.  I wanna have a talk
with you.

BUTTERS
Well, sure thing, Dad.

DAD
Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.


BUTTERS
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you
told me so.

DAD
Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are
also times when distorting the truth
a little ih, is appropriate. These are
called "little white lies."

BUTTERS
Little white lies?

DAD
Ya see, sometimes telling a little white
lie is okay. Like, for instance, when
you catch your father jacking off in
a gay men's bath house.

BUTTERS
...Uh, who's Jack?

DAD
Butters, the point is that, I think
that if you told Mommy what Daddy was
doing tonight, weh, she might go completely
insane.

BUTTERS
Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.

DAD
It won't? Oh, good.

BUTTERS
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and
she's fine.

DAD
You... what?

MOM
Butters, Mommy wants to take you for
a little drive now.

BUTTERS
A drive? Oh, boy!  I I love a good drive.
Is Dad comin' too?

MOM
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and
think.

BUTTERS
Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh
boy, a drive!

BUTTERS
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed
how angry I was when Teacher said I
had to share my fingerpaints, because
I've been sharin' them all along.


MOM
Butters, you know that Mommy loves
you an awful lot, don't you?

BUTTERS
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.


MOM
And sometimes moomies do things that
seem hurtful to their babies, but it's
really for the best.

BUTTERS
Oh, you mean like the time you washed
my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack"
in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to
behave myself.

MOM
If a mommy has to end her life, she
can't let her baby alone in the world
to be raised by a sick pervert.

BUTTERS
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose,
yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?
It's cold out here.

MOM
I'm going to get out of the car now,
Butters.  I want you to stay put with
your seat belt fastened.

BUTTERS
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.


[she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency
brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away
from the water, and the car starts to move forward]

You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view
of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'.
Looks like I'm headin' for the water.

MOM
Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy
will be with you very soon.

BUTTERS
Well, I think I- Yeup, it looks like
the car is fillin' up with water!  Yeah.
I think right now might be a good time
to try to get the car out, Mom!

["The Butters Show" splash screen]

CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[Butters' house, night, living room. His mom has returned home
and is now writing a note. A noose hangs over the coffee table,
ready for her to use when the time comes. His father, apparently,
is not home]

MOM
"Dear bastard husband," No.  "Dear lying
sonofabitch," No.  "Dear assface," Yeah,
that's it. "I will no longer-"

DAD
Linda?? What are you doing??

LINDA
Stay away from me, bastard!

DAD
Linda, I know this is very hard-

LINDA
You don't know anything!

DAD
I've been wanting to stop going to those
places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still
love you!

LINDA
Then why, Chris, why??!!

DAD
It just... it started as some curiosity
on the Internet. I would chat with other
married goes in the chat rooms and...
Well the things they woudl talk about,
Linda, I, I don't know why I found it
exciting. I just did, and it, and it
grew from there and it spun out of control,
and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!


LINDA
Well,  you don't have to worry about
your family being in your way anymore!


DAD
No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle!
It's just kind of an addiction. I want
help. And I'm going to get help. Please,
just give me a chance to make this all
up to you.  We can have a normal life!


LINDA
There is no going back, Chris!

DAD
Sure there is!

LINDA
No!  Our son is dead!

DAD
What?

LINDA
I killed him.  I was going to end it
all, and everything spun out of control
for me. I drowned Butters iin the car,
Chris!

CHRIS
Oh no.  No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what
were you thinking?

LINDA
I WASN'T THINKING!  I couldn't think!
You destroyed my life, you!!  D'Oh,
God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss-


CHRIS
This can't be happening! This is a
bad dream.

LINDA
Just go away and let me die!

CHRIS
No! Linda, we-

LINDA
I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have
a life now!

CHRIS
Linda, Butters is gone.  Oh Christ,
if Butters is gone, then... there's
nothing we can do about that. But I
won't let you go to jail, I promise,
Linda! Pleeease!

[A river, day. The family car come into view, floating down the
river, with Butters still strapped in.]

BUTTERS
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna
stop! I must be all the way down to
Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally.
Uh now that the car has come to a stop,it's
safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.
Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about-
me right now. Ah I goota get back home.
Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?

BUTTERS
That's me!

[Butters' house, day. A News 4 crew is there, with reporter in
place. So is a crowd of spectators and other news media]

NEWS 4 REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in front of the home
of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living
every parent's nightmare right now,
as last night, while Ms. Stotch was
driving with her son in the car, a man
stopped her, put a gun to her head,
andn took her son away. When asked who
the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, "Some
Puerto Rican guy." Naturally, the police
are in an all-out manhunt for some Puerto
Rican guy.  Uh, it looks like the parents
are about to make a statement, Tom.


REPORTER 1
Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet
from the man who took your son?

LINDA
No, no, not yet. But if you're out there,
we beg you: we just want our baby returned
safely back to us.

NEWS 4 REPORTER 1
Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper
look like?

LINDA
Puerto Rican.

NEWS 4 REPORTER 2
Was he tall? Short.

LINDA
He was... average Puerto Rican height.
Please, just bring our baby back to
me.

["The Butters Show" splash screen]

...Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[The highway, day. He's in a Busy Beavers moving truck going
uphill]

BUTTERS
And so them my friend started hollerin'
at me, sayin' "you took my rubber bands."
Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did.
I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I
sure am lucky you came along, Mister.


TRUCK DRIVER
Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause
I need some God-damned poontang.

BUTTERS
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang
myself right now. Have you ever been
to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is
great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow
night with my family. Oh, I can just
see it now.  We'll walk in the front
doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess
lady will take us to our cozy booth
Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks,
for appetizers.  Dad will open his present,
and Mom will open hers  Uh then the
Bennigan's wait staff will sing

Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's

[the entire staff sings at the table as the family listens]


Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's

[the sequence is cut short as the driver gets annoyed]

Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's

[the truck stops and the driver exits to make his way to the
passenger side]

Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate
milk? [the driver opens the door, plucks Butters out, set him
by the side of the road, closes the door, and heads back for
the driver's side. He gets in and drives off. Butters watches
him go, then turns to face the receding truck...] He must like
TGI Fridays.

[Butters' house, day. The news crews and the crowd are gone.
Inside, the parents sit on the sofa as the police and detectives
handle the case. The phone rings. Chris rises, but the police
chief stops him]

POLICE CHIEF
Let us handle it.  Barbrady?

BARBRADY
Hello?

[Rob's Sassy Ladys titty bar. A few men sit around looking at
an exotic dancer works her way around a pole. Butters is at a
pay phone nearby]

BUTTERS
Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?

BARBRADY
Who is this?

BUTTERS
Uh, is this the Stotch residence?

BARBRADY
Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?


BUTTERS
...No.

BARBRADY
Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?

BUTTERS
...No.

BARBRADY
We need to keep this line clear. Call
back another day.  It wasn't the abductors,
sorry.

OFFICER 1
Chief! Two more parents from the next
town over have shwon up saying their
child might have been killed by the
same guy that took the Stotch boy.


POLICE CHIEF
Really?

OFFICER 2
This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from
Boulder.

JOHN RAMSEY
We saw your story on the news, and
we were so sorry to hear about your
loss.

PATSY RAMSEY
Our daughter was killed a few years
ago, in our house.

LINDA
Yes, I... remember hearing something
about that.

JOHN RAMSEY
A and we realized... The man that murdered
your son must be the same person that
killed our daughter!

PATSY RAMSEY
Yes, because we certainly didn't do
it! No.

JOHN RAMSEY
No, huh.

PATSY RAMSEY
No.

CHRIS
Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't
know that he's dead yet.

THE RAMSEYS
Riiight.

CHOIR
...Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[A road, day. Butters walks along and comes to a fork in the
road. A gas station sits in the middle of the fork, and a mechanic
works on a red car. Butters approaches him]

BUTTERS
Sir? Hello?

MECHANIC
Hallo, what can I do for ya?

BUTTERS
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh,
if you give me a ride, I could pay you
the four dollars I made at the titty
bar.

MECHANIC
Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park
for the weekend. Won't be back until
Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride
Sunday, if ya like.

BUTTERS
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating
with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.


MECHANIC
Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.


BUTTERS
Uh will I eventually get to South Park
if I follow this road?

MECHANIC
'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want
to go to South Park, you gotta go down
that rod.  'Course, I ani't nevuh seen
anyone ngo up that rod. Six years ago
a group of campers went up there and
got lost. Had to eat each other to say
alahv. Used to be the way to O'Riley
house. He butchered over fifty children
and kept their bodies in a cellah. But,
you should find an old bridge about
halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you
know? They built it with the bones of
two hundred Chinese laborers who were
massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta historih
down that rod.

BUTTERS
...Well, it's my parents' anniversay
tomorrow,  and they're gonna be awful
sad if I'm not there with 'em.

MECHANIC
Well, uh good luck then.

BUTTERS
Oh jeez.

MECHANIC
...or is South Park down that rod?


[I Am Siam Thai Cuisine restaurant, day. Inside, the Ramseys
and the Stotches are seated at a booth, men on the inside, women
on the outside. Lunch is served]

JOHN RAMSEY
It's so very hard to lose a loved one,
isn't it?

CHRIS
Yes, it, it sure is.

PATSY RAMSEY
Thank goodness we have each other to
share our grief.

LINDA
Thank goodness.

JOHN RAMSEY
Here he is.

A POLITICIAN
John! Patsy!

JOHN RAMSEY
Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris
and Linda, this is our good friend,
Congressman Gary Condit.  He also lost
someone close to him and thinks it something
to do with the same Puerto Rican guy
that hurt our kids.

GARY CONDIT
We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch!


CHRIS
Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.

GARY CONDIT
I spoke with the FBI and some Puerto
Rican guy has just made their Number
One Most Wanted, heh.

PATSY RAMSEY
Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him.
Oh, here's another member of our support
group.  O.J.

O.J. SIMPSON
Hey guys.

GARY CONDIT
Chris, Linda, you know O.J. Simpson.


LINDA
Oh. Sure.

PATSY RAMSEY
O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh some
Puerto Rican guy, too.

O.J. SIMPSON
Yup, it was some Puerto Rican guy all
right.

JOHN RAMSEY
So you see, Chris and Linda, there are
people like you all over the country
who've been affected by some Puerto
Rican guy.

GARY CONDIT
Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official
part of the group.

JOHN RAMSEY
Yeah!

PATSY RAMSEY
Yeah!

O.J. SIMPSON
Alright!

PATSY RAMSEY
One of us! One of us!

GARY CONDIT
Gooble gobble gooble gobble!

O.J. SIMPSON
One of us!

[the two lines happen together]

O.J. SIMPSON
One of us! Gooble gobble!


[The scary road, night. The skies have cleared to reveal a bright
full moon. The camera moves down to the road and Butters comes
into view singing to himself]

BUTTERS
For family fun and great food, too,
come on down to... Bennigan's

[a shadow flies over the trees in front of him, and an eerie
cry is heard. He stops]

Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's


[a snarling sound is heard. He stops and turns right, looking
into the trees]

Uhuh, hello? [after a while of looking, he turns left and starts
walking again] So come and eat at...

A VOICE
Why can't he see us?

BUTTERS
...Bennigan's.

You'll love all our... shenanigans.

[the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are ained
at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something...
He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks
back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is
shown. Butters turns left and start walking agian. The three
dots remain trained on his forehead]

Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.


["The Butters Show" splash screen]

CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[Butters' house, day, the anniversary has arrived. Inside, Chris
and Linda are fighting over the details of the unfolding story
of Butters' disappearance. He sits on the sofa; she's pacing
the floor, crying, and both are unkempt]

CHRIS
Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say
that the abductor is Costa Rican!  You
have to learn to keep it straight!


LINDA
I can't keep it straight when you keep
inventing new parts to the story!


CHRIS
Hey, don't forget that I'm covering
for you!

LINDA
Don't forget: your lies started all
this.

CHRIS
My lies may have been deceitful, but
your lies cover up something much more
horrible than anything I ever did!


BUTTERS
Happy Anniversary!

CHRIS
Not now, Butters!

BUTTERS
Oh.  Alright, then. I-

LINDA
Butters?? Oh, Butters!

CHRIS
Son! I don't believe it!

BUTTERS
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into
the lake, and it floated all the way
down the river. I tried callin' home,
but it was-

LINDA
Oh, my baby's back!

BUTTERS
I ain't grounded, am I?

CHRIS
No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why...
Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell
a little white lie about where you've
been though, alright?

BUTTERS
Lie?

LINDA
Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going
to have to say you don't know how you
got home.

CHRIS
No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican
man dropped you off!

LINDA
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped
him off?!

BUTTERS
Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.


CHRIS
Now we don't really have a choice,
do we?!

LINDA
You're the one that made up the stuff
about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!

BUTTERS
Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.

CHRIS
Well you're the one who couldn't back
it up wit a description, stupid!

BUTTERS
Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here!
Now I am sick of these harmless lies
and l-little white lies. You know, you
can call a shovel an ice-cream machine,
but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad.
Ah, and you can call a lie whatever
you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin'
lie! And when you start coverin' up
one lie with another why, now that's
when you get into real trouble!  Boy
I've, I've just about had it up to here
with you two!

CHRIS
...Butters... You're as right as rain.


LINDA
You sure are.

BUTTERS
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin'
at ya, am I?

LINDA
No, Butters. You're the best son in
the whole world.  And I am so happy
you're alive.

BUTTERS
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too,
Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?


CHRIS
You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have
something they have to do first.


[Butters' house, day. The news media and the spectators are back
at the Stotch house for another press conference.. The front
door opens and the Stotches step forth to the podium, all cleaned
up and well-dressed. Cameramen begin taking pictures]

CHRIS
We... have an announcement to make,
um. Our son has been returned to us.


MAN IN CROWD
Wow, alright

STAN
Butters was missing?

CHRIS
But, that isn't all we have to say.
You see, we learned a very important
lesson tonight and it took the smarts
of our young son to show us.

BUTTERS
Yeah!

LINDA
We've learned that deception is wrong
and that the only thing to ever make
it right again is to come clean.

BUTTERS
Yeah!

CHRIS
You see, I've been deceiving my wife
for several months. I was going to gay
movie- and bathhouses and having sex
with random men who were complete strangers.


BUTTERS
Ye-!  wait, what?

CARTMAN
Huho!

LINDA
And when I found out I went crazy,
I went crazy and I drove my son into
the lake to kill 'im.

BUTTERS
Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!

STAN
Damn, dude.

CHRIS
So you see, there was no "some Puerto
Rican guy." He doesn't exist. And so
the people we owe the biggest apology
to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit,
and O.J. We gave you false hope for
finding the person who hurt those close
to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just
happy we won't have to live a life of
secrets. For I knew that even though
some of you supported us, some others
were looking at me and thinking, "You're
a liar! You're a LIAR!"  "You know somethin'
that you're not telling us, you slimy,
scumbag LIAR!!"  Eh you know, that's
what people would say to me. And then
people would see my wife at the supermarket
and they would say, "Hello," but they'd
be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"
"You got away with MURDER you murdering,
lying, waste of life!!"  And to me,
people might say things like,  "LIAR!
Tell us what you know you God-damned
LIAR!!"  And so, to both of us, people
all over town would be saying things
like,  "You know God-damn well what
happened to your kid, so stop acting
like victims, and confess, you MURDERING
MURDERERS!!"  "CONFESS!!"  "LIAR!! CONFESS!!"
You know, and, that's what people would
be saying to us, and so, we just had
to come forward and tell the truth.


LINDA
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't
happen again.

CHRIS
And now, if you'll excuse us, this family
has to get to Bennigan's.

MAN 2 IN CROWD
Yeah-ah-alright!

STAN
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your
mom tried to kill you.

BUTTERS
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna
rip on me at school now.

CARTMAN
We sure are.

BUTTERS
I really wish I didn't know that stuff.
I guess I learned that sometimes, lying
can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when
I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon
burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about
my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin'
to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.

STAN
Really?

BUTTERS
Naw, I'm lyin'

CHRIS
Let's go, son.

BUTTERS
Wuh comin', Dad!

CHOIR
Everyone knows it's Butters!

BUTTERS
That's me!

[Butters' house, night, kitchen. Linda is serving drinks. The
Marshes and the Broflovskis are at table. Sheila holds Ike on
her lap]

SHARON
Thanks for having us all over for dinner,
Chris and Linda.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, it was fabulous.

LINDA
Oh, we're just really happy that your
boys have become such good friends with
our little Butters.

CHRIS
Yeah. We figure that if our boys are
goona be great friends, we should all
get to be friends, too.

LINDA
Freinds, by default.

RANDY
Well, our boys do seem to be spending
a lot of time together lately. I think
ever since their friend Kenny died they've
been looking for someone to fill the
void.

CHRIS
Well, our son is a perfect void-filler.
It's nice that he finally has your sons
to be his best buddies!

[Butters' house, living room. The four boys sit on the sofa looking
at television, except Butters is asleep at one end]

CARTMAN
Look you guys, Butters is asleep.


STAN
He's such a douchebag

CARTMAN
Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?
When someone's sleeping, you can take
a glass of warm water,  and you put
their hand in it...

STAN
Yeah, and then what?

CARTMAN
And then, you pee on it!  heheh, heheheheheheheh.


KYLE
No, dude, you're supposed to put their
hand in warm water and it makes them
pee.

CARTMAN
Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh,
heh

[Butters' house, kitchen. Conversation goes on]

CHRIS
And we were thinking, since they've
all become such close friends, how great
it would be for us to all go together
to Aspen for a ski weekend.

KYLE'S FATHER
A-Aspen? Ohhh, we, we can't really afford
that.

CHRIS
No, you see, Linda and I found this
ad where you can get two night free
at a condo in Aspen if you attend a
time-share presentation..

RANDY
They let you stay for free?

CHRIS
Yes! And all we have to do is attend
a thirty-minute meeting!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well that sounds like a good deal.


RANDY
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait!


CHRIS
Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen fior
the weekend!

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
All right!

BUTTERS
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies!
Oh, I'm all sticky.

[The Rocky Mountains, day. Chris Stotch drives all three families
and Cartman off to Aspen]

CHRIS
Here we are, everyone.

[Fade in, next morning. The adults sit around a coffee table
while the kids sit at the dining table eating breakfast behnd
them. The adults are getting dressed for the day]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I
haven't skied in years!

CHRIS
Where are Butters and Eric?

STAN
They're still asleep.

CHRIS
Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get
to the powder!

MAN
Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is
Josh . We're with the Aspen Time-Share
Company.

THE PARENTS
Hello.

JOSH
You folks enjoying the condo?

KYLE'S MOTHER
It's lovely. Thank you.

[The dining table]

CARTMAN
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna
believe this, this is sooo funny!


KYLE
What

CARTMAN
So last night, while Butters was asleep,
I gave him a Hitler.

STAN
What's a Hitler?

CARTMAN
You know, when somebody is sleeping
and you put your finger up your butt
and then, wipe it on their upper lip
to give them a little Hitler mustache?
You've never Hitlered anyone?

STAN
No, I never have.

CARTMAN
Shh-shh, here he comes.

BUTTERS
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to
go skiin'?  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so
funny?

CARTMAN
Nothing, Butters. Right, guys??

[The front door]

PHIL
Well, we can't wait to show you what
Aspen Time-Share is offering investors.
Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?


RANDY
Oh, do we have to do it right now?


JOSH
Well, best to do it and get it out of
the way.

CHRIS
Okay.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Boys, we have to go to this time-share
presentation real quick, but you go
meet your ski instructor on the bunny
hill.

THE BOYS
Okay.

CHRIS
We'll meet you boys on the slopes.


BUTTERS
Hey, do you guys smell that?

STAN
Smell what?

BUTTERS
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this
condo.

CARTMAN
I don't smell anythng. Do you guys?


[Music fades in. Exterior shots of the resort are shown .The
bunny slope is shown. Lifts go up and down as kids practice skiing
moves. The four boys and Ike are shown waiting for their instructor.]


BUTTERS
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad
out here, too. I'm starting to think
this whole town smells like doodoo.


CARTMAN
Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen.


SKIER
All right, little dudes,  great to see
you out here. My name is Thumper, and
I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor.


CARTMAN
His name is Thumper?

THUMPER
We're gonna take it slow, take it easy,
make sure everybody has a goood time.
'Cause what is skiing about? Having
a good...?  Tiime, that's right. Now,
just a few safety things to keep in
mind: First of all, look straight ahead
when you ski. You look down, you're
gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad
time. Also, be aware of skiers around
you. You run into another skier, your
skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad
time.

BUTTERS
So where's the part where we have a
good time?

THUMPER
Hey, little dude, you got some crap
right here.

BUTTERS
Wuh that's my face, sir.

THUMPER
Alright, we're gonna do this without
any poles until we know our two primary
feet positions. To go slow, we wedge
our skis together , in the shape of
a slice... of pizza. Then to go faster,
we put 'em parallel, like... French
fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French
fries,  Pizza,  French fries.

BUTTERS
Ah hey, this is gonna be just like eatin'
at Shakey's, huh fellas?

THUMPER
Okay, let's have the little dude at
the end try first! What's your name?


IKE
Iiiiike!

THUMPER
Okay, Mike, ski down to me!

KYLE
Go on, Ike.

IKE
Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries.
Fron friiiies.  Peeee-zaaa

THUMPER
Okay, you see what he did? He French-fried
when he should've piiza'd. You French-fry
when you should pizza, you're gonna
have a bad time.

[The meeting, meanwhile. Phil and Josh are presenting the time-share
plan]

PHIL
And so, we think we can convince you
to buy one of our combos that's opening
right here in Phase 4.

JOSH
That sounds like a GREAT investment
opportunity!

KYLE'S FATHER
I I'm sorry, but none of us can really
afford to own our own vacation condo.


RANDY
Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing
this meeting because of the two nights
free deal.

PHIL
Oh, I know, that's what everybody says
- "Not me, I can't afford it." But what
if I told you you could own one of our
properties for only eight thousand dollars?


JOSH
Wow!

KYLE'S MOTHER
For only eight thousand dollars we can
buy a condo here?

PHIL
Well you see, "time-share" means you
buy the condo with about twenty other
people like yourselves  You  "share"
the condo with other investors and pick
the  "time" you want to stay.

JOSH
Share,  time.  Time share.

RANDY
So then it's not really ours.

PHIL
Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a
half yours! You see, time-share has
made it possible for even working-class
people like you to say, "I've got a
little place in Aspen."

JOSH
Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little
place in Aspen."

THE PARENTS
I've got a little place in Aspen.

PHIL
Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say
guys, how'd you like to tell that hot
secretary "I've got a nice little place
in Aspen"? Hahaha. Just kidding, wives.


RANDY
Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes.
We'd like to go hit the slopes now?


PHIL
Woll uh, you still gotta come to the
time-share luncheon. We did give you
a free condo for the weekend.

KYLE'S FATHER
Well your ad said we only had to attend
a thirty-minute meeting.

PHIL
R-right, but this isn't that meeting.
The luncheon is that meeting.  Don't
worry, you're gonna have a great free
meal at the luncheon.

[Bunny slope, later.]

KYLE
...french fries... pizza... french
fries...  come on, Cartman.

CARTMAN
Ugh, no more.

SKIER
Looks like you think you're a pretty
good skier, huh, kid?

STAN
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast,
I guess.

SKIER
I've been skiing for twenty-two years.
Think you could beat me?

STAN
Uhh no.

SKIER
What's your name, hot shot?

STAN
Stan. Marsh.

SKIER
Stan Marsh  Stan DARSH is more like
it.

SKIER 2
Haaaa, Darsh!

SKIER
Alright, how about a race, then? You
and me.

STAN
Dude, I'm just learning.

SKIER
OooooOOOOooo!  Looks to me like you're
not a "hot shot" after all.

STAN
I never said I was.

SKIER
Oooooooo!

SKIER'S FRIENDS
Oooooooo!

SKIER
You may think you've got what it takes,
but as long as I'm around, you'll always
be number two!  See ya leter, Darsh!


[The meeting at Aspen Heaven, later. Phil and Josh are still
extolling the time-share plan]

PHIL
And THAT is why owning a piece of an
Aspen condo is not only possible,...


JOSH
It's downright smart!

KYLE'S FATHER
Aha.

PHIL
Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous
free lunch!

KYLE'S FATHER
Wow, filet mignon and lobster!

SHARON
Not bad.

JOSH
It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, you know, this is really great.


CHRIS
It sure it.

RANDY, GERALD
What?

RANDY
Wait...

PHIL
You see? That's the great thing about
time-share. You get a little taste of
luxuries you can't afford.

JOSH
And then share it with the people who
come tomorrow.

RANDY
All right, look, we've been here for
over three hours

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah. Can we go now, please?

PHIL
Of course you can. Go hit those slopes!
If you could just please show me the
backs of your table place cards real
quick?  Oh my God! You got the red sticker!


JOSH
They got the red sticker?

PHIL
They got the red sticker!

CHRIS
What's the red sticker?

JOSH
Uh, well, well, that means if you come
up to the condo sales office you'll
receive one of three great prizes.


RANDY
No, nononono. We, we did your meeting
and we did your lunch, we're finished,
okay.

PHIL
Okay, okay, fine, I mean...  It would
only take a second, but, I mean, you
know, what did we do for you except,
give you a free condo for the weekend.
Huh. Seems like you coud just... could
just come up... and see what prize you
had...

CHRIS
A-all right!

[The bunny slope, even later. Kyle and Stan are skiing down faster
now, mastering the basic pizza-French fries technique]

STAN
...pizza...French fries...Frnehc fries...pizza...


KYLE
...French fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-French
fries... I wonder where our parents
are.

STAN
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my
own.

SKIER
well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!


STAN
Oh no.

SKIER
Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take
Heather out for some fondue tonight,
do ya?

STAN
Heather?

HEATHER
Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it
comes to skiing, Tad has all the right
moves.

TAD
I just might show her my moves tonight,
if you know what I mean.

HEATHER
You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean,
a girl's gotta look out for her best
interests.

STAN
...who are you people?!

TAD
Still don't wanna race me? I told you
he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh
the Darsh!

STAN
All right dude, if I race you will you
leave me alone?

TAD AND FRIENDS
Oooooooo!

TAD
Allright, fine. You and me at the summit,
now!

STAN
Okay.

TAD'S TWO FRIENDS
Race! Race!

[Ski run, moments later. A view from the bottom shows a long
run, and the resort's main buildings off to the right near the
finish line]

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen, Aspen Mountain
presents another ex-TREME racing showdown.
Seven-time World Aspen champion Tad
Mikowski versus eight-year-old Stan
Marsh!

TAD
Hah! You're going down, little boy!


STAN
Yeah, prob'ly

BUTTERS
Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh
go Stan!

STAN
Fries... fries...

A SKIER
He's got it! Tad's gonna win it!


TAD
Yeah! Yeeaah! Yeah!! You lose, Darsh!!
Yeah!

BUTTERS
U-u-uh, Stan, ya-you gave it your best
shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.


STAN
Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid
thing is all over with.

TAD
No hard feelings, right Darsh??  Yeah!!


TEEN GIRL
Stan,  for what it's worth, I think
you were really brave.

STAN
Thanks. Who are you?

TEEN GIRL
Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be
at the youth center tonight for a dance.
I hope you'll come because you're just
so... wehell, you're just so.. well,
that's all.

[The valley, day. There are three long lines of people waiting
to ski. The parents finally make it out of the meeting]

KYLE'S FATHER
Finally, we get to go skiing!

RANDY
Oh my God, look how long the lift lines
are.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share
salesman gave us will come in handy.


LIFT OPERATOR
Can I help you?

CHRIS
Yes, we have the special passes to use
the exclusive lift from the time-share
comapny?

LIFT OPERATOR
Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Thank you.

RANDY
Well, this certainly is nice.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski
earlier, but with this lift we'll get
more runs in than anybody.

CHRIS
Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!


LINDA
Oh, Chris.  Hey look, this lift goes
right into a building.

[Aspen Heaven meeting room, again.]

PHIL
Welcome back, folks

JOSH
We've got a special offer we can't wait
to tell you about!

RANDY
Oh, God-damnit!

[Aspen Youth Center. Teens enter from all sides. The boys go
in as well.]

KYLE
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where
the hell are our parents?!

[Aspen Youth Center, inside. The boys find themselves on a dance
floor listening to a live band]

TEEN GIRL
I'm glad you guys came. Do you like
our youth center?

STAN
Seems fine.

VOGUING SKIER
Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down.
That hot-shot skier Tad's father is
gonna bulldoze the building

VOGUING SKIER 2
Where are all us kids supposed to go?


STAN
Don't care.

KYLE
What do you wanna do now?

STAN
I dunno.

BUTTERS
Let's dance.

CARTMAN
Butters, I hate you with every inch
of my body.

ANNOUNCER
Alright, Aspen, heh. As a special treat
tonight we're proud to have the winner
of today's race, Tad Mikowski. <>i>


TAD
Yeah!

STAN
Oh God.

TAD
Hey everyone.  I'd like to sing a little
song, if I may.

THE LADIES
Ooooooooo.

STAN
Gah, let's go you guys.

TAD
This is a song I wrote about... Stan
Marsh.

Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...

Stan. Darsh. Darshy Daaarsh

Stan Daaarsh

Stan Darsh, Standarsh

Stan Daaaaarsh Daaarsh

Stan Darsh...

STAN
Dude, what the hell is your problem?!


TAD AND FRIENDS
OooOOOOOOoooooo!

STAN
I raced you, You won.

TAD
A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're ven dumber
than I thought.

TEEN BOY
He'll ski you anytime, anywhere

TEENS
Yeah!

TEEN GIRL
But this time, if he wins, you get
your dad to not close our youth center


STAN
What???

TAD
Alright then, let's make it interesting.
Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13.


A TEEN BOY
The K-13? But that's the most dangerous
run in all of America.

TAD
Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?!


STAN
I'll be there, you queen!

TAD
Oh YEAH?!

STAN
Yeah!

TAD
Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I
thought! Again! See ya tomorrow.

[The Youth Center, outside. The boys exit the center]

BUTTERS
Uh you're not really gonna go down that
K-13 run, are ya, Stan?

STAN
Dude, I have to!

KYLE
Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get
to you. Scrwe him, dude.

STAN
Dude, he's got Heather!

KYLE
You don't even know Heather!

STAN
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't
explain it but I have to do this. I'm
not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the
K-13 be?

MECHANIC
The K-13? You don't wanna go down that
run. That run has got a historih. Thirty-five
people have died goin' down it, and
some say you can still see their ghosts
up there. It was on that very ski run
that a group of students were killed
by a wolfboy who escaped from a mental
institution. You see, that ski run was
once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire
wichicaw who ate the flesh of children
with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history
on that ski run.

STAN
...Thank you.

MECHANIC
Yah.

KYLE
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned
how important friends are. I'm not gonna
lose another friend.

STAN
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to
do this, okay? I have to!

[Aspen Heaven, next day. The parents are still meeting with Phil
and Josh]

PHIL
...And so you see it's the investment
opportunity that keeps on giving.


KYLE'S FATHER
How many times do we have to tell you
this? We don't want to buy shares in
a condo!

JOSH
And we certainly don't want to pressure
you.

KYLE'S FATHER
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday
and then had a chair lift bring us back!


PHIL
Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want.
Of course, that is, if you don't want
the super-secret fun prize for attending
the slide show.

RANDY
No, we dont want the super-secret fun
prize alright?! We just wanna ski!!
Come on, everybody!!

JOSH
I know! Have you ever considered going
in on a time share?

PHIL
That's only a couple thousand each,
Josh!

RANDY
Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!


[Aspen Heaven, the hallway. The parents walk down the hall]


KYLE'S FATHER
My God, can you believe those people?!


CHRIS
I hope you don't blame me for all that.
I mean, the ad ...did... just say a
thirty-minute presentation.

RANDY
Let's just get out of here.

PHIL
Folks, I'm glad you're back, because
we forgot to mention, time-share condos
are still deeded properties!

PARENTS
Aaagh!!

PHIL
Oooo, you folks REALLY lucked out this
time. You're visitor number one thousand!


JOSH
That means you can listen to our special
offer for privileged members only!


STAN
That does it! I'm calling the police!


[Bunny slope, day. Beginners practice their moves. A girl stands
next to Thumper; he sets her up and sends her on her way]

STAN
Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of
training, fast. I'm gonna race down
the K-13.

THUMPER
K-13? But you're just a beginner! You
ski outta your league, you're gonna
have a bad time.

STAN
I have to do this, okay? I have to!


THUMPER
Alright, well, if you gotta get good
at somethin' really fast, there's only
one way to do it. Come on!

[A song begins to play. Thumper is giving Stan some quick instructions
and then Stan starts skiing. Thumper looks on, encouraging]


You've got to reach your prime!

[Thumper and Stan do some Tai Chi on their skis, then Thumper
has Stan ski down the hill blindfolded while he takes notes on
technique and time]

That's when you need to put yourself to the test

And show us the passage of time


We're gonna need a montage (Montage)

A sports-training montage (Montage)

And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.

Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)

[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but
a group of familes shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot,
the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and
tired]

And with every shot, show a little improvement

To show it won't take too long


That's called a montage (Montage)

Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)

[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much
he's improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing
after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl
reads to Stan some more, but Stan's fallen asleep. She rouses
him and resumes the lesson]

In any sport, if you want to go

From just a beginner to a pro

You'll need a montage (Montage)

a simple little montage (Montage)

[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing
down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands
on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully
at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives
a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]


Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)

[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now
Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl,
and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their
backs]

If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed
in a montage (Montage)

Montage (Montage)

[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly. Stan sets
his skis down and steps into them, then skis down the slope.
Fade out]

[Aspen Heaven meeting room, day. Two officers are present with
the two salesmen and the six parents]

RANDY
Alll the ad said was that we had to
attend a thirty-minute meeting, right,
and, and it's been a day and a half!
These guys won't let us leave!

PHL
That's not true, officers, we said they
could leave at any time.

THIN COP
All right, let me see if I got this
straight. You two gentlemen are offering
part-time limited liability  ownership
in one of your fabulous condos for the
one-time price of eight thousand dollars?


PHIL
That's right!

FAT COP
Sounds to me like if anybody should
be arrested it should be YOU people
for passin' up such a great deal!


THIN COP
That's right, you're practically stealing
condos at that price. "Book 'em, Danno!"


RANDY
Oh, Jesus.

LINDA
No! Nooo!

KYLE'S FATHER
The police work for time-share, too?


PHIL
The police, the mayor, the president
of the United States. Perhaps now you
see the severity of your situation.
I think we shall all sit down...  and
listen to the presentation.

JOSH
Sit!

PHIL
Now, you're probably asking yourselves...
"Can my time-share condo turn into a
profit?"

JOSH
"What kind of cash flow can I realize
from my investment?"

PHIL
The answer might astonish you. For over
ten years investors have seen their-


[Aspen Heaven ski run, finish line area, day]

ANNOUNCER
The powder is fresh and the stage is
set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!


[K-13 peak. Tad and Stan are ready to ski]

TAD
This time you're not just goin gto lose,
you're gonna die!

[Finish line area. The other boys and Ike are presnt, with their
instructor behind them]

KYLE
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny
and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left
are you two douches.

ANNOUNCER
Ready. Set. Go!

STAN
Pizza... pizza... pizza...

MAN IN YELLOW JACKET
Tad's got the lead.

BUTTERS
Come on, Stan!

TAD
Haha.  This shoud slow down Darsh a
bit!

ANNOUNCER
And it looks like Tad is way out in
front.

TAD
Now I'll win for sure!

KYLE
Awgh, dude, I can't look.

TAD


Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! [leaves.
Stan continues his run. Tad returns with more sand and pours
it out]

He doesn't stand a chance, now! [Stan reaches the fallen tree
and climbs over it, then continues his run. Tad pours out even
more sand]

I'm gonna beat 'im! [tosses the bucket away and leaves]

ANNOUNCER
The race is half over and Tad is still
out in the lead!

TAD
Huh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let
all these hamsters go. That should distract
him just long enough for me to win the
race!

TEEN GIRL
Oh Tad.

TAD
...What are you doing up here?

TEEN GIRL
Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract
you. With these.

KYLE
Good job, dude!

STAN
Thanks.

ANNOUNCER
You did it, Stan!

TEEN GIRL
Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna
be able to keep the youth center.


MECHANIC
Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits
of the Wakachaw Indians can finally
rest in peace.

HEATHER
Stan, I was wrong about you. Would
you like to go out again?

TEEN GIRL
Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you
ever wanted.

KYLE'S MOTHER
There you are, boys!

KYLE
Mom, Dad!

STAN
Where the hell have you guys been?!


CHRIS
Uh we got a little held up at the time-share
sales office.

RANDY
Yeah, but the good news is we finally
came to our senses and bought some shares
in a condo. So we all get to come to
Aspen for two weeks every year!

THE BOYS
Awwwwww!

CHRIS
What's the matter? Didn't you boys like
skiing?

STAN
No! We can't keep track of when you
pizza and when you French-fries and
when the hot-shot asshole skier takes
your girl or if you're supposed to race
him the first time or train first to
beat him on the really difficult mountain
so you can save the dorky but hot girl's
youth center. Skiing sucks!

KYLE
Yeah, what a stupid sport!

THUMPER
I heard that you were the one responsible
for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.


TEEN GIRL
Yeah. Well he really flipped when he
saw these.

LEFT CREATURE
Quaid...

RIGHT CREATURE

"SOUTH PARK"

Episode 201

Terrance & Phillip in "Not Without My Anus"

Written by

Trisha Nixon and Trey Parker



ACT ONE

NARRATOR
Since the last South Park, you've
waited four long weeks to find out
who the father of Eric Cartman is.
Now finally the shocking truth about
Cartman's lineage... Will not be
seen tonight so that we can bring
you the following Special
Presentation.

Black screen with super serious MOW music with the titles
rolling...

NARRATOR
Now, get ready for Canada's hottest
action stars. Terrance and Phillip.
The HBC movie of the week. Not Without
My Anus, based on a true story.

"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP PRESENT,

TERRANCE AND PHILLIP IN,

TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S "NOT WITHOUT MY ANUS."

FADE IN:

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

It's a high, sweeping, super serious MOW shot.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The Prosecuting Attorney, SCOTT, is standing before a jury.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
Ladies and gentleman, before you
today sits a murderer. On the night
in question, this monster entered
the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and
struck him repeatedly in the head
with this hammer.

The Prosecutor holds up a hammer. It has blood and hair all
over it.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
That monster is sitting right over
there and his name is Terrance!

He points to the defense table where Terrance sits and shrugs
nonchalantly and then lifts his ass cheek to fart. His defense
attorney, Phillip, laughs.

PHILLIP
Oh, Terrance, you've farted in court.

TERRANCE
Yes, Phillip, I'm making a case for
our defense!

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

The Prosecutor continues, pacing in front of the jury. He
has before him an endless table of physical evidence.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
All of these things link Terrance to
the murder. Hair fibers, blood
samples, nail clippings, a piece of
his shirt...

He holds up the fabric. Terrance casually covers the rip on
his sleeve and smiles at the jury.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
A watch with his initials on it, a
dayplanner with the murder
scheduled...

The prosecutor holds up the dayplanner page. It has a skull
and crossbones and says, "Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer 7:30.
Dinner with the McCullough's 8:15."

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
...a haiku called Time To Kill Dr.
Jeffrey O'Dwyer
(counting the syllables
on his hand as he
reads)
"Doctor O'Dwyer, Time to have your
head smashed in, with my new hammer."

Terrance shrugs.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon
but you're not God! Do you think
you're God?! J'accuse, Terrance!

With a big dramatic fingerpoint, we pan quickly over to
Terrance. He smiles at the jury, then farts.

TERRANCE
Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?

PHILLIP
Yes, please.

Terrance lifts his ass cheek and farts a different sounding
fart.

TERRANCE
That's called the monkey claw because
it feels like my colon is being ripped
apart by a thousand monkeys!

PHILLIP
The monkey claw is smelly!

Terrance laughs. The OLD BLACK FEMALE JUDGE smacks her gavel
and speaks in a slow, drowsy southern-Canadian drawl like a
hillbilly bear.

OLD BLACK FEMALE JUDGE
Come on, get a move on. I ain't
gettin' any younger up here.

PHILLIP
My sentiments exactly, your honor. I
see from your accent that you're
Southern-Canadian.

OLD BLACK FEMALE JUDGE
That is correct.

Phillip stands and addresses the jury.

PHILLIP
Good people of the jury. My client,
Terrance, is an innocent man.

Phillip farts.

TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, now you've farted during
the closing argument.

PHILLIP
I have, haven't I, Terrance?

He farts again. The jurors start to smile.

PROSECUTING ATTORNEY SCOTT
Your honor, the defense is trying to
make a mockery of this court! They
think that farts are funny!! But
they're not!!

OLD BLACK FEMALE JUDGE
Sustained.

PHILLIP
Good people of the jury. My client,
Terrance, is no more a murderer than
you or me. He loves puppies and hates
mean things.

He shows a picture of Terrance giving a carrot to a llama.

PHILLIP
Would a murderer go to the zoo and
feed animals like this? Of course
not. So, in summation, find Terrance
innocent... Or else he'll KILL you!!

The jury gasps.

PHILLIP
Ha, ha! Just kidding!

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

PHILLIP
The defense rests.

Phillip crosses to his chair. He stops and farts on the
Prosecutor again as he passes.

SCOTT
God dammit! That isn't funny!!

JUDGE
Madame foreperson, have you reached
a verdict so we can get hell out of
here?

FOREPERSON/WOMAN
We have, your honor. We have found
Terrance, in the above entitled action
of murder against Dr. Jeffrey
O'Dwyer...

Just then, Terrance lets a huge fart rip and it drowns out
the verdict. He and Phillip roar with laughter. Everyone
looks around confused.

JUDGE
You're gonna have to repeat that
verdict because we had some flatulence
issues.

FOREPERSON/WOMAN
I said, we find Terrance...

Terrance lets another one rip. We still can't hear the
verdict. He and Phillip laugh their asses off and fart. The
forewoman screams in between farts.

FOREPERSON/WOMAN
We find Terrance... Not guilty!

Terrance hugs Phillip.

PHILLIP
Did you hear that, Terrance. You're
not guilty!

TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, you've saved me from
the GAS chamber!!

Terrance and Phillip think aboot this for a long time...
Then finally break out laughing.

PHILLIP
Oh, HA HA HA!!!

They laugh, fart and hug. Scott, the prosecuting attorney,
broods.

EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - LATER

Phillip and Terrance walk down the steps toward the parking
lot. We can see the big, Canadian flag behind them. Lots of
REPORTERS and PROTESTERS are gathered out front.

TERRANCE
That sure was fun Phillip, let's go
home and eat Kraft Dinner!

PHILLIP
Here, here!

Scott, the Prosecuting Attorney, emerges.

SCOTT
Well, looks like you got you got
away with it, Terrance and Phillip!

PHILLIP
Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings,
right ol' pal?

SCOTT
There ARE hard feelings!! THIS ISN'T
OVER!! I'M GOING TO SEE TO IT THAT
YOU BOTH PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!!
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?!?!

PHILLIP
'Cause you're a dick?

SCOTT
NO! Because I hate you! You think
farting is so funny! Well it isn't!
Fart jokes are the lowest form of
comedy, and --

Phillip farts, they laugh.

SCOTT
AGH!!! I hate you both!! I've hated
you ever since I can remember, I
hate you, and I wish you both had
cancer.

PHILLIP
Cancer?

SCOTT
Yes. In the head.

TERRANCE
Head cancer?

SCOTT
This is NOT the end TERRANCE AND
PHILLIP! YOU'LL RUE THIS DAY!!!

Scott walks away.

TERRANCE
Wow! Scott really hates us, Phillip.

PHILLIP
Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.

Terrance thinks.

TERRANCE
But we're not gay, Phillip.

PHILLIP
We're not?

TERRANCE
Well, let us board the subway and
return home. There we can eat Kraft
dinner.

PHILLIP
Yes, It's been a long day. And only
Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.

INT. CANADIAN SUBWAY

Terrance and Phillip sit side by side on the subway as it
goes in and out of tunnels. Going light to dark to light
again...

Ta-chink, ta-chink, ta-chink...

Finally, Phillip rips a fart, and both Terrance and Phillip
laugh hysterically.

TERRANCE
Say Phillip, why does Scott always
try to convict me of murder? He does
it every week.

PHILLIP
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder
what he'll try to do next?

TERRANCE
God only knows.

PHILLIP
The subway certainly is wonderful
Terrance.

TERRANCE
It sure is. Let's look for treasure.

PHILLIP
Yes, let's look for treasure.

Terrance and Phillip look around their immediate area. Half-
assedly turning over seat covers.

INT. SCOTT'S HOUSE

Scott answers his ringing phone.

SCOTT
Hello?

SADDAM
Hello, is this Scott from Canada?

SCOTT
Yes.

SADDAM
You're a journalist, right?

SCOTT
Yes, I'm a television critic for
magazines.

VOICE
I understand that you hate Terrance
and Phillip.

SCOTT
Yes, Yes I do! They think that fart
jokes are a sophisticated form of
comedy, but they're not!

VOICE
Well, what if I were to help you get
rid of them once and for all?

SCOTT
Who IS this?

VOICE
Let's just say...

INT. SADDAM'S PRESIDENTIAL PALACE

SADDAM
That I'm someone who can help you,
if you help me. Just call me your
ol' pal Saddam Hussein.

SCOTT
Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?!

SADDAM
Hey, relax guy. I'm just your average
Joe. Take a rest.

SCOTT
What do you want?

SADDAM
You want Terrance and Phillip OUT of
Canada, I want you to bring me and
my friends IN to Canada. That sounds
like a fair trade doesn't it. Super,
let's get started.

SCOTT
I'm not sure that I should trust
you.

SADDAM
Hey, relax, guy! Trust me

FIRST COMMERCIAL BREAK

EXT. TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S HOUSE - DAY

The men walk towards their humble home.

TERRANCE
Well, it's too bad we didn't find
any treasure on the subway, Phillip.

Just then, another character who looks JUST LIKE Terrance
and Phillip walks in.

PHILLIP
Oh hello, ugly Bob.

UGLY BOB
Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip.

TERRANCE
My God you're looking hideously ugly
today, Ugly Bob.

UGLY BOB
How come you guys say stuff like
that?

TERRANCE
Because you're God damned ugly, Bob.

UGLY BOB
I know, but --

PHILLIP
Ugly Bob, your face looks like
somebody tried to put out a forest
fire with a screwdriver.

UGLY BOB
I can't help how I look. Besides,
it's not what's on the outside that
matters, it's what's on the inside.

TERRANCE
No it isn't.

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

TERRANCE
Wanna see what's on the inside of
me?

Terrance farts. They laugh.

PHILLIP
Wait, wait! I've got an idea! Why
don't you put this paper bag over
your head, Ugly Bob?

Phillip pulls out a large brown paper bag.

TERRANCE
Yes, if people can't see your face,
they won't know how wretchedly ugly
you are!

UGLY BOB
Really?

Ugly Bob puts the paper bag over his head.

UGLY BOB
Hey, thanks you guys. Maybe now I
can score with chicks.

TERRANCE
Sure you can, Ugly Bob, if they can't
see how horribly disfigured you are,
they'll want to sleep with you.

UGLY BOB
Thanks, you guys.

Ugly Bob leaves, Terrance and Phillip head into their house.

INT. TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S HOUSE

The men walk in.

PHILLIP
Hello, Barkie! Hello, Purry!

Terrance and Phillip's dog and cat bark and meow respectively.

PHILLIP
Say, Terrance, I was just aboot to
make some Kraft dinner. Would you
like some?

TERRANCE
You know I never turn down Kraft
Dinner, Phillip.

Terrance crosses the room.

TERRANCE
I'm going to go put on a pirate
costume.

The doorbell rings, Phillip answers it.

A DELIVERY MAN enters with a letter.

DELIVERY MAN
Special delivery for Terrance.

TERRANCE
I'll take that.

DELIVERY MAN
Sign here. And here. And here. And
here. And here...

Terrance signs. The Delivery Man points to another place on
a form.

DELIVERY MAN
And here.

He takes the form, gives Phillip the letter, and exits.

PHILLIP
Oh Terrance! You got a letter!

Terrance walks in.

TERRANCE
Shiver me timbers Phillip! At this
rate, I'll never get to my Kraft
dinner!

Terrance opens the letter and reads it.

TERRANCE
Oh my God!

PHILLIP
What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?

TERRANCE
No, it's Sally. She's being held
captive in Iran!

PHILLIP
Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance!
Why Sally? God, why?!

BIG MUSICAL SWELL. THEN

PHILLIP
Say, Terrance... Who's Sally?

TERRANCE
My daughter.

PHILLIP
I never knew you had a daughter,
Terrance.

TERRANCE
Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me
hearties?

PHILLIP
No, you never did, Terrance.

TERRANCE
Oh. Well, it all began fifteen years
ago...

CUT TO:

EXT. TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S HOUSE

A TITLE reads 'FIVE HOURS LATER'.

CUT TO:

INT. TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S HOUSE

PHILLIP
My God! What a fascinating story,
Terrance! Especially the part aboot
Celine Dion.

TERRANCE
Yes, indeed. But now my little Sally
is being held captive in Iran. And I
will have to go and find her.

PHILLIP
Then I will go with you, Terrance.

TERRANCE
You are such a good friend, Phillip.

PHILLIP
Well, you know what they say; 'A
friend in need is a friend with Kraft
Dinner'.

TERRANCE
A lass there maties!

EXT. CELINE DION'S HOUSE

DING DONG -- Celine Dion answers the door.

TERRANCE
Hello, Celine Dion.

CELINE DION
Terrance. This is quite a surprise.

TERRANCE
You're looking well.

CELINE DION
And you.

TERRANCE
Celine, where is our daughter Sally?

CELINE DION
She's in the middle east, studying
Anthropology, why?

TERRANCE
Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and
is now being held prisoner.

CELINE DION
What?!

TERRANCE
Phillip and I are going to Iran to
find her, but we may never return.

CELINE DION
Oh Terrance, what happened to us?

TERRANCE
We just grew apart Celine Dion.

CELINE DION
Please bring our daughter home safe,
Terrance.

Terrance farts.

TERRANCE
Ha ha ha ha ha!!!

INT. CANADIAN AIRPORT

Terrance and Phillip walk up to the airport ticket counter.

PHILLIP
Hello, Ugly Bob.

Bob is behind the ticket counter with the bag on his head.

UGLY BOB
Hi guys.

TERRANCE
How's the paper bag working out?

UGLY BOB
People seem to really like it. I
even have a date this Friday.

TERRANCE
Terrific. We need two tickets for
Teheran, please.

UGLY BOB
Iran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't
go there.

PHILLIP
(slamming the desk)
Dammit, man! Danger or no, I'm going
to help my friend find his daughter!!!

Terrance laughs in the background.

UGLY BOB
Alright, then, there's a flight
leaving today.

PHILLIP
Oh, good...

Bob types up the ticket on his computer.

PHILLIP
Well, I certainly am going to miss
Canada, Terrance.

TERRANCE
Indeed, Phillip.

PHILLIP
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran...
Please bring my body back to Canada
and bury it in a box with a side of
Kraft dinner.

TERRANCE
Same here, Phillip.

PHILLIP
(singing)
Oh Canada! Our home and native land!
True patriot love in all thy sons
command.

Now Terrance joins in.

TERRANCE
(singing)
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
The True North strong and free!

Now ugly Bob, and some people next to him join in.

UGLY BOB
(singing)
From far and wide, O Canada, We stand
on guard for thee.

Now absolutely everyone in the airport stops what they're
doing, stands up, and joins in.

EVERYONE
God keep our land glorious and free!
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

Now Scott leans in from behind a wall.

SCOTT
Scott to Red Dragon. Come in Red
Dragon.

INT. STRANGE ROOM

Saddam Hussein is sitting at his desk with a couple of guards.

SADDAM
Go ahead gug. This is Red Dragon.

SCOTT
The plan is working perfectly.
Terrance and Phillip have taken the
bait.

SADDAM
Excellent. My buddies and I are ready
to come to Canada, has everything
been arranged?

INT. CANADIAN AIRPORT

SCOTT
Yes. Everything's proceeding according
to plan. Now you promised that when
Terrance and Phillip arrive they
will be ripped into pieces and shot
several times.

SADDAM
Hey, relax guy! I'm gonna keep my
side of the bargain!

SCOTT
Roger, red dragon. Scott out.
(under his breath)
I've got you now, you fart loving
fart lovers...

INSERT - WORLD MAP

We see a map of the World. With Indiana Jones type music
playing, a red line shows the path of the airplane.

We watch as the line leaves it's home in Canada (The map
says only Canada) and slowly makes its way towards Iran.

Meanwhile, we HEAR Terrance and Phillip FARTING and LAUGHING
during the long trip.

EXT. IRAN

Terrance and Phillip walk down the crowded, insane Iranian
streets.

TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, how will I ever find my
fugitive daughter in this daunting
place? We don't speak the language,
we are unwelcome strangers, and we
have no idea where to begin!

They walk a little further.

TERRANCE
Oh look, there she is.

In the midst of Iranian people, little Sally, who is white,
stands out like a sore thumb.

PHILLIP
Oh, good.

They walk over to Sally.

SALLY
Who? Where?

TERRANCE
I'm here, Sally. It's your father,
Terrance. I'm here to save you from
your smelly Iranian captors.

SALLY
Papa!

Terrance and Sally hug.

PHILLIP
Say, she looks a lot more like Celine
Dion than you, Terrance.

Sally rips a fart and laughs.

PHILLIP
OH, NOW I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE!!

TERRANCE
Well, enough of Iran, let's get home.

EXT. PLANE

We see the plane heading back the other way.

EXT. CANADIAN AIRPORT

TERRANCE
Well, now that I have my bastard
daughter back, I feel like going
back to Celine Dion's house and asking
her to marry me again.

PHILLIP
Oh Raspberries, looks like I'm losing
a friend.

TERRANCE
No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.

PHILLIP
OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THIS?!?!

Terrance and Phillip look around, and see that Canada has
completely changed.

Most everything has been colored red, and large paintings of
Saddam Hussein hang everywhere.

PHILLIP
Is this Canada?

TERRANCE
It seems to have changed...

PHILLIP
THIS IS MADNESS!!!

DRAMATIC MUSIC.

ACT II

EXT. CANADA - DAY

Terrance and Phillip walk down a Canadian street, where most
of the buildings have been painted red. Huge framed pictures
of Saddam are everywhere.

TERRANCE
What's going on, Terrance? How could
Canada have changed so much whilst
we were gone?

PHILLIP
I don't know, Terrance. And who is
that smelly person in all these
pictures?

TERRANCE
I must take my bastard daughter back
to Celine Dion, and she what she has
to say.

Terrance and Phillip walk up to Celine's door and knock.

TERRANCE
Celine, I've brought our daughter
Sally back. And I want to tell you
that --

CELINE DION
Terrance... Uh... Could you come
back a little later?

PHILLIP
Why?

CELINE DION
Uh... I'm just a little busy right
now...

TERRANCE
You've got a MAN over, don't you
Celine Dion!!

CELINE DION
Well, I --

Ugly Bob walks up to the door. The brown paper bag is still
on his head.

UGLY BOB
Hi guys.

PHILLIP
Oh my God! It's Ugly Bob!!

TERRANCE
What the hell are you doing here?!

UGLY BOB
I'm doing Celine Dion, what's it
look like?

TERRANCE
Oh Celine Dion, what have you done?!
I was going to make us a family again
but now you've slept with ugly Bob!

CELINE DION
What do you mean? Why are you calling
him 'Ugly Bob'?

PHILLIP
Because that's his name, you stupid
bitch!

CELINE DION
(to Bob)
You told me your name was Handsome
Bob.

TERRANCE
Look at him, Celine Dion!

Terrance grabs the paper bag and rips it off. Bob still looks
just like Terrance and Phillip.

CELINE DION
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHGHHH!!!!

As Celine screams, there is a Hitchcock perspective zoom on
her face.

PHILLIP
Behold his horrible face!!

CELINE DION
OH MY GOD!! HE IS HEINOUSLY UGLY!!
AND I AM PREGNANT WITH HIS CHILD!!!

TERRANCE
WHAT?! NOOOoooo!!

CELINE DION
I'm going to have a freak baby!!

PHILLIP
Oh, the humanity!!

INT. STRANGE ROOM

Saddam is sitting at his desk. Scott walks in.

SCOTT
Hey Saddam, you helped me get rid of
Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate
that... But why are framed pictures
of you going up all over Canada?

SADDAM
Huh? Oh, that. Don't worry guy, you
just need a rest.

SCOTT
No I don't need a rest! I want to
know what this is all aboot!

SADDAM
Hey, relax fella, I'm just making it
so that Terrance and Phillip can
never come back to Canada again. I
just need a couple of things, and
then I'm gonna head back to Iran.

SCOTT
I thought you were from Iraq.

SADDAM
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the
difference? Relax, guy.

Scott thinks.

INT. CANADIAN STREET - DAY

A huge, Iraqi army marches past Terrance and Phillip.

Terrance farts, and they laugh merrily.

TERRANCE
Phillip, I'm convinced that something
very very not good is happening to
Canada.

PHILLIP
Yes, I agree whole fartledly.

Just then Scott walks up.

SCOTT
Hey! What the hell are you guys doing
here?

TERRANCE
Oh, hello Scott.

SCOTT
You're not supposed to be here! You're
supposed to be in Iran looking for
your kidnapped -- Uh... I mean, uh...
How are you today?

PHILLIP
Wait, what were you saying?

SCOTT
Nothing. Why?

TERRANCE
Hey Scott, guess what?

SCOTT
What?

Terrance farts.

SCOTT
Ah! I hate you more you more than
ever Terrance and Phillip! I
absolutely abhor you both!

Scott holds both his hands towards Phillip.

PHILLIP
What are you doing, Scott?

SCOTT
I'm wishing cancer upon you.

PHILLIP
Cancer?

SCOTT
That's right! I'm trying to give you
cancer with my mind.

TERRANCE
Agh! Stop that!

Terrance tries to hide behind Phillip.

PHILLIP
Hey! Don't give me cancer!

INT. STRANGE ROOM

Some American Generals come in (*NOTE - Since the generals
are American, they should be drawn in South Park style).

GENERAL
Mr. Hussein, the U.S. government is
becoming worried.

SADDAM
Worried? About what? Take a load
off. Relax.

GENERAL
You seem to be... Taking over Canada.

SADDAM
Taking over Canada? Me? Hey, you
need a rest fella. I'm not hiding
any bombs!

GENERAL
We didn't say anything about bombs.

SADDAM
Oh... You didn't? Hey, relax.

GENERAL
We're giving you just three years to
clear your forces out of Canada.
After that, we're going to bomb all
of Iran.

SADDAM
I'm from Iraq.

GENERAL
Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?

The Americans leave.

IRAQI SOLDIER
OOH! I HATE AMERICANS!!! PLEASE LET
ME KILL THEM!!!

SADDAM
No, no, you need to relax, guy.
Remember the plan, first we take
over Canada, then we'll have the
best of the Female Pop Vocalists.
After that, we'll take over the U.S.,
then Europe, Then China, Then
Newfoundland, THEN THE WORLD!!!!!

Saddam laughs maniacally. Suddenly, Scott barges in.

SCOTT
What's so funny?

SADDAM
Nothing. Relax, buddy.

SCOTT
Saddam! Terrance and Phillip are
back in Canada!

SADDAM
Oh, really?

SCOTT
You promised me they'd be gone for
good! That was your part of the
bargain!

SADDAM
I changed my mind. Pray that I don't
change it any further.

Dramatic music. Scott looks afraid, and steps out.

SCOTT
This deal is getting worse all the
time.

INT. TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S HOUSE - DAY

PHILLIP
Hey, Terrance let's watch American
television!

TERRANCE
Yes! We can get satellite feed from
the U.S. and watch all of their stupid
T.V. shows!

Phillip hits the remote control.

PHILLIP
Oh look, here's a show --

It's Jerry Springer.

PHILLIP
God damn their TV shows are lame!

He changes the station to 'South Park.'

PHILLIP
Look at their silly American heads!

TERRANCE
They look like groundhogs!

He changes the station to CNN.

NEWS ANCHOR
And in other news, it appears that
Saddam Hussein has finally signed an
agreement to let the US inspect his
military operations. When asked if
he would uphold his side of the
agreement, Hussein replied, quote
'Hey, relax fella, you need a rest,
guy'.

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, isn't that the smelly
gentleman we've seen in pictures all
over town?

PHILLIP
Yes it is, Terrance. According to
that newsy, he's some kind of Turkish
dictator!

TERRANCE
Well we can't just sit here and eat
Kraft Dinner and let Canada been
overrun by the Turks.

Just then, the phone rings.

PHILLIP
That fart sounded just like a ringing
phone Terrance.

TERRANCE
It sure did Phillip.

The phone rings again.

TERRANCE
Oh wait, that is the phone. Hello?

SCOTT
Terrance, this is Scott.

TERRANCE
Oh.
(to Phillip)
Hey, it's Scott.

PHILLIP
Tell him he's a smelly bastard.

TERRANCE
Phillip says hello, Scott.

SCOTT
Just shut up and listen. You've
unleashed a monster onto Canada and
only you can get rid of him. Even
though I hate you, and I wish you
had cancer.

TERRANCE
You are such a dick, Scott.

SCOTT
YOU'RE a dick.

TERRANCE
YOU'RE a dick.

SCOTT
YOU'RE a dick.

TERRANCE
YOU'RE a dick.

SCOTT
...

TERRANCE
...

SCOTT
YOU'RE a dick.

TERRANCE
YOU'RE a dick.

SCOTT
The two of you are the most annoying
dicks in Canada! You give other
Canadians a bad name... and if I
had...

TERRANCE
Oh, I'm sorry Scott, could you hold
on a minute?

SCOTT
Sure.

Terrance puts the phone down to his ass and blows a huge
fart into it.

Scott reacts as if it hurt his ear.

Back on the phone --

TERRANCE
Ahhh!! How do you like that, Scott?!

SCOTT
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if
it's the --

TERRANCE
Oh, wait, I have another call, Scott,
can you hang on?

SCOTT
Sure.

Terrance again puts the phone to his ass and blows a huge
fart.

PHILLIP
OHH!! That was Sir Smelley! He says
hello!!

SCOTT
GOD DAMMIT!!

TERRANCE
Oh, wait a second, Scott.

SCOTT
Sure... I mean No! You listen to me!
If you want to save Canada, you'll
meet me at Karl's Kraft Dinner
Restaurant in half an hour.

Click. Scott hangs up.

EXT. CELINE DION'S HOUSE - DAY

Celine and Ugly Bob are lying in bed, smoking. Ugly Bob still
has a paper bag over his head.

CELINE DION
Oh, ugly Bob... I'm so confused. I
love your personality, but you are
so wretchedly ugly.

UGLY BOB
Maybe the baby will have your face
instead of mine.

CELINE DION
We can only hope... I suppose we'll
be okay, as long as you keep that
bag on your head.

Suddenly, there is horrible commotion. A group of Iranian
soldiers break into the room. Saddam follows close behind.

CELINE DION
What's this?!

SADDAM
Hey, there. My name's Saddam. I'm a
big fan of Polo. I've been searching
a long time for you Celine Dion.

UGLY BOB
Oh no you don't! She's my bitch!

SADDAM
Who are you?

UGLY BOB
I'm Bob. But my friends call me ugly
Bob, because I have the features of
a deformed burn victim.

SADDAM
Really? I thought all Canadians looked
alike. Let me see...

Ugly Bob lifts his paper bag. Everyone in the room screams
horribly. Even Celine Dion.

SADDAM
Wow, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I
could cure that face of yours.

UGLY BOB
You could?

SADDAM
Sure, I just need a favor. There's a
Canadian football game tomorrow. The
Ottawa Roughriders against the
Vancouver Roughriders. It's at that
game that I will officially turn the
Canadian flag over to my Iranian
one.

CELINE DION
What? Why?!

SADDAM
Hey, don't worry about that. Take a
load off. Don't think about it. Look
over here. All I need is for Celine
Dion to sing our Iranian National
Anthem at the game, to finalize my
hostile takeover of Canada. What'dya
say?

UGLY BOB
Did you say hostile takeover of
Canada?

SADDAM
No, no, relax there, fella.

EXT. CANADA - KARL'S KRAFT DINNER PALACE - DAY

Terrance and Phillip are waiting in front of the Palace.

TERRANCE
Well, Scott said to meet him here,
but now he's not showing up.

Phillip farts, they laugh.

PHILLIP
Well, while we're waiting, why don't
we search for treasure?

TERRANCE
Oh, good idea! Let's search for
treasure!

Terrance and Phillip again look around their immediate area
for treasure. But find none.

Finally, Scott walks up.

SCOTT
What are you idiots doing?

TERRANCE
We're looking for treasure!

SCOTT
Is that some kind of metaphor for a
kind of search that can't be
described?

Terrance and Phillip think.

PHILLIP
No... We're searching for treasure.

SCOTT
Listen, I have an inside scoop.
There's an Iraqi dictator who is
quietly and slowly taking over Canada.

TERRANCE
Yes, you mean Saddam Smelly. We saw
him on the tele.

SCOTT
Well, what are you two gonna do aboot
it?

PHILLIP
What do you mean?

SCOTT
It's YOUR fault that he's here! YOU
brought the Iraquis back with you on
your plane when you rescued your
kidnapped daughter.

Terrance and Phillip GASP!

PHILLIP
You mean WE are to blame?!

SCOTT
That's right, and now you must make
amends. Tomorrow Saddam will try to
finalize his takeover of Canada at
the Roughriders/Roughriders football
game. All his soldiers will be there.
It will be your only shot at wiping
them all out. Here, take this.

PHILLIP
What is it?

SCOTT
It's a bomb. You must strap it to
yourselves, go to the game, and
sacrifice your lives to take out
Saddam's minions.

TERRANCE
That sounds scary.

SCOTT
Well, you must do it, for Canada.

PHILLIP
For Canada, Terrance.

TERRANCE
For Canada, Phillip.

Terrance and Phillip walk away, and Scott is left alone.

SCOTT
Yes... Yes... Terrance and Phillip.
And when the dust has settled, Canada
will be rid of both the Iraqis...
AND your immature fart humor!

DRAMATIC MUSIC.

ACT III

INT. TERRANCE AND PHILLIP'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Terrance and Phillip are sitting on their couch.

TERRANCE
Well, Phillip I am very sad that we
have to die for Canada.

PHILLIP
Yes, this bomb will blow us both to
smithereens. But we really have no
choice. Only our deaths can bring
Canada life.

Terrance farts. They laugh.

PHILLIP
Wait a minute... Terrance that fart
gives me pause...

TERRANCE
Why is that?

PHILLIP
That smelly Saddam Hussein, he uses
germ and chemical warfare, does he
not?

TERRANCE
Yes, apparently he does.

PHILLIP
Terrance, get the phone book! We
must call every Canadian we can!

TERRANCE
Oh, Phillip, it sounds like you have
an idea.

PHILLIP
I do Terrance
(picking up the phone)

EXT. CANADIAN FOOTBALL STADIUM - DAY

We see the last play of the second quarter.

ANNOUNCER
And the Roughriders are really giving
the Roughriders a run for their money.
All else aside, I must say the
Roughriders are simply out matched
by these Roughriders.

The play ends. The clock runs out. The referee blows his
whistle.

ANNOUNCER
And that's going to take us to
halftime. Be sure to stick around
for the halftime show, Saddam and
the Electric Iraqi's in a salute to
hostile takeovers.

Terrance and Phillip are sitting in the stands.

TERRANCE
Well, I guess it's time, old friend.

PHILLIP
Yes... Prepare the alert!

A lame marching band takes to the field. They are cheesy and
gay.

A quick stage is made, where Saddam and his friends appear.

SADDAM
Hello to my Canadian friends.
Everybody relax, take a rest, put
your feet up, those dogs are barking.

The audience looks confused.

SADDAM
You may have noticed some changes to
your country. Don't worry about that,
the changes will continue. I am here
to announce once and for all --

ZOOM IN on Saddam.

SADDAM
THAT CANADA WILL NOW BE KNOWN AS NEW
BAGHDAD! KOO LOOK KA LOOK!!

Iraqi guards lower the Canadian flags and raise Iraqi flags
in their place.

The audience GASPS!

SADDAM
YOU WILL BOW DOWN TO ME AS YOUR
RULER!! YOU WILL OBEY MY LAWS OR YOU
WILL BE KILLED!!! HA HA HAAH HAA!!

Celine Dion and Ugly Bob take the stage.

SADDAM
AND NOW YOU WILL SING THE IRAQI
NATIONAL ANTHEM -- OR YOU WILL BE
STABBED IN HEAD!!!

Celine walks up to the mic and starts to sing.

CELINE DION
(sadly)
Shtood makalek svtdot inka inka
broost...

MUSIC starts. A guard puts the tip of his gun in Celine's
back and makes her take the stage.

TERRANCE
Now, Phillip?

PHILLIP
Now, Terrance!!

Terrance and Phillip pull out gas masks. Terrance put a mighty
Canadian Horn to his lips.

Terrance blows the horn. Brrr ba ba BRRR!!!!

Suddenly, every audience member in the stadium puts on a gas
mask.

SADDAM
What the hell is this?

CELINE DION
(still singing)
barak a shtood, kalak a shtood...

Now all the audience members, with their gas masks, bend
over and point their asses at the field.

With one mighty ROAR all of the Canadians FART!! Blowing hot
noxious gas onto the Iraqis.

SADDAM
(Choking)
NOOOO!!!!

GUARD
They're using chemical warfare! How
could they?!

Just then Celine Dion and Ugly Bob put on their gas masks.

They fart along with everyone else. Until the entire stadium
is one big smelly dust cloud.

Terrance and Phillip, meanwhile, are laughing their asses
off at all the farts.

Finally all the dust settles, the air clears, and we see
that all the Iraqis lie dead or near death on the field.

All the Canadians remove their gas masks and celebrate by
cheering and jumping up and down.

TERRANCE
WE DID IT, PHILLIP! WE'VE DESTROYED
THE TURKS!!

PHILLIP
OH GLORIOUS DAY!!

Everybody happily takes to the field.

Terrance and Celine Dion embrace. 'Don't you forget about
me' from the Breakfast Club starts to play.

CELINE DION
Terrance! Terrance! You've saved
Canada!

TERRANCE
Oh, it was all Phillip's idea!

UGLY BOB
God bless you, Phillip.

PHILLIP
Don't touch me, ugly Bob.

Just then Scott walks up.

SCOTT
What the hell happened! You were
supposed to be blown up!

PHILLIP
We came up with a better plan. You
see Scott, after all your criticism
it was farting that saved Canada!

SCOTT
Oh! That is SO JUVENILE!!!

TERRANCE
Hey Scott, do you like apples?

SCOTT
Of course.

Terrance farts a huge wet one of Scott's head.

TERRANCE
How do you like THEM apples?!

Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

SCOTT
I HATE YOU TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!

TERRANCE
Oh, Celine Dion... You never finished
that National Anthem.

CELINE DION
You're right Terrance, You're right...

Celine steps up to the mic and sings:

CELINE DION
OH CANADA! OUR HOME AND NATIVE LAND!
TRUE PATRIOT LOVE IN ALL OUR SONS
COMMAND!!

EVERYONE
WITH GLOWING HEARTS WE SEE THE RISE
OUR TRUE LOVE STRONG AND FREE. WITH
GLOWING HEARTS OH CANADA WE STAND ON
GUARD FOR THE. GOD KEEP OUR LAND
GLORIOUS AND FREE OH CANADA WE STAND
ON GUARD FOR THEE. OH CANADA WE STAND
ON GUARD FOR THEE.

Episode 803


"THE PASSION OF THE JEW"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Cartman's house, day. A minivan rocks gently on the street.
Inside, the boys make their interpretations of spaceship noises.
Good boys that they are, they're strapped in. They're wearing
football helmets and makeshift Starfleet uniforms]

CARTMAN
Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft
Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega
Nine.

STAN
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence
initiated.

CARTMAN
What kind of atmosphere are you reading
on the planet surface, Jew?

KYLE
I'm a Vulcan!

CARTMAN
All right, what kind of atmosphere are
you reading, Vulcan Jew?

KYLE
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should
support our breathing.

CARTMAN
All right, hang on. We're about to land.
Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer
Kenny, you come with me on the away
team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.


KYLE
No! I'm on the away team too!

CARTMAN
It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the
captain, Kyle!

KYLE
I don't care! You're not making me wait
in the van again!

CARTMAN
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong
out there on the planet surface, don't
hold me responsible.

[The side door slides open. Cartman leads the other three out,
so Kyle joins them after all.]

CARTMAN
Set phasers on stun.

STAN
Things seem pretty quiet.

CARTMAN
Yes. A little too quiet.

KYLE
I am picking up carbon-based life forms
in Sector C. I believe we will find
a village of peaceful aliens over that
ridge.

CARTMAN
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for-
Oh no!! Look out!! It's a giant four-headed
lava frog!! Shoot it!!  Oh no, it got
Kyle!!

KYLE
No it doesn't.

CARTMAN
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his
head off!!  Aw you guys, it looks like
Kyle is done for.

KYLE
No I'm not! Goddamnit Cartman, you're
not gonna kill me off again!

CARTMAN
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't
bring Jews along on the away team: they
don't play along!

KYLE
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't
know anything!

STAN
Oh God, here we go again.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie,
The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in
the movie, Jews are the Devil!

KYLE
He does not!

CARTMAN
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion
thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't
seen it once! There's even one part
where the Jews have a chance to save
Jesus, and you know what they do? They
let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free
instead and laugh about it.

KYLE
Naw uh!

CARTMAN
Go see the movie, Kyle!!

STAN
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing
about The Passion! I'm out of here.


KENNY
(Me too!)

KYLE
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's
being an asshole!

CARTMAN
You know what it is? You're scared.
You're scared of the truth. You don't
want that movie to show you just how
bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates
you.

KYLE
People don't hate the Jews!

CARTMAN
Really? Three hundred million domestic
box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film
of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't
lie. If you're not scared of The Passion
then go see it. Go see it and tell me
I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.


KYLE
...You're a stupid asshole!

CARTMAN
Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.
Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft!


[The Bijou, day. Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ is now
playing. Kyle walks up to the ticket booth, stops, turns back,
stops again, and steps up to the window. He gives the cashier
$20]

KYLE
One please.

SHLOMO
This is an R-rated movie.

KYLE
Yeah, I know, but I have to-

SHLOMO
But, because this is such an important
film that actually depicts the selfless
act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in
to see it.

KYLE
...Thanks.

[The Bijou, inside. Kyle enters and makes his way to a seat.
He watches.]

SOLDIER 1
Hac bashtud Christo.

SOLDIER 2
Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.

JESUS
Wa!

KYLE
Haaaah!

JESUS
Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!!


[The Bijou, outside. Kyle walks outside in a daze.]

KYLE
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?


SHLOMO
Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna
make you change your life, huh?

[Cartman's house, day. He's on the couch eating cereal]

ANNOUNCER
And now, back to Terrance and Phillip.


PHILLIP
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-

CARTMAN
Mom! Doorbell!

TERRANCE
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.


CARTMAN
Mom! Answer the door!

TERRANCE
Hey Phillip, guess what?

CARTMAN
Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore.

PHILLIP
What?

KYLE
You were right. You were right all along.
I thought you were just an asshole when
you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't
know, I... I didn't know.

CARTMAN
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just...
say that first part again?

KYLE
You were, you were right?

CARTMAN
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.

KYLE
You were right.

[Cartman's house, his bedroom. Cartman's on his knees]

CARTMAN
I want to thank you for all the blessings
you have brought me. You have shown
me the way so many times in the past
and... now you are making all my dreams
come true. You give me strength when
there is doubt, and I praise you for
all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson,
have had the wisdom and the courage
to show the world the truth. From this
day forward I will dedicate my life
to making sure your film is seen by
everyone. I will organize the masses
so that we may do thy bidding. Hail
Mel Gibson. Amen.

[Stan's house. He and Kenny are in his bedroom reading a newspaper.]


STAN
Look at that, dude. The Passion has
made almost 400 milliion dollars at
the box office now.

KENNY
(Goddamn.)

STAN
Everyone in the country's gonna see
that movie. I guess... we have to ge
see it too.

[The Bijou, day. No clouds around. Stan and Kenny sit inside
in the middle, looking at the movie. The movie ends]

STAN
Dude. That movie sucked.

KENNY
(Yeah, it totally sucked!)

STAN
How can they even call that a movie?


KENNY
(I dunno)

STAN
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our
money back.

KENNY
(Yeah!)

[The Bijou, outside. A couple emerges]

JACK
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's
death was.

ELISE
Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good
Christians from now on!

MAN 1
I think if more people saw The Passion
they'd have faith in Jesus.

WOMAN 1
Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into
believing.

STAN
Hey, we want our money back.

SHLOMO
Huh?

STAN
That movie sucked ass. Give us back
our eighteen dollars.

SHLOMO
I can't refund your money. You sat through
the whole movie.

STAN
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff
film!

KENNY
(Yeah!)

STAN
You can't charge people to watch a guy
get tortured for two hours!

SHLOMO
That guy happened to be Jesus, and he
went through all that to pay for YOUR
SINS!

STAN
We go to church to learn that stuff!
We go to movies to be entertained! We
weren't entertained, and we want our
money back!

SHLOMO
I'm now allowed to give you your money
back after you sat through the whole
movie! You'd have to take your complaint
up with the film's producers.

STAN
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we
have to get our money back from Mel
Gibson?

SHLOMO
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.

STAN
Oh, we will! This is America! And in
America, if something sucks, you're
supposed to be able to get your money
back! Come on, Kenny!

PRIESTS
Kill him! Guilty! Kill him!  Kill him!
Kill him! Die!

KYLE
Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh!

[Stan's house, day. Stan and Kenny are at Stan's computer]

STAN
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson
bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson...
home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel
Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source
for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy,
upcoming projects. Damnit, no phone
number! Oh wait! "For more information
on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at
1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we
go.

MEL GIBSON

FAN CLUB LINE

[the phone rings. Cartman answers.]

CARTMAN
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.


STAN
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to
see The Passion

CARTMAN
Uh huh, and so you want to join the
fan club now. Our first meeting is at
5:30 p.m.

STAN
Nonono, no, we want our money back.


CARTMAN
What?

STAN
We think the movie sucked and we want
Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen
dollars. Do you know how we can get
in touch with him?

CARTMAN
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently,
you don't understand what Mel Gibson
was trying to do! He was trying to express,
through cinema, the horror and filthiness
of the common Jew. It has made people
the world over open their eyes.

STAN
Look, kid, we just thought it was a
bad movie, so tell us how to get in
touch with Mel Gibson so we can get
our money back!

CARTMAN
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd
be down on the floor licking his balls
at this very moment, sir. All I know
is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now
stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time,
you little wussy prick.

STAN
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid!
I'll kick your ass!

CARTMAN
Ohoh yeah?! I'd like to see you try,
asshole! I'm like six feet tall!

STAN
I don't care! You sound like a little
bitch to me!

CARTMAN
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop
your fuckin' head open!

STAN
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little
pussy?!

CARTMAN
I already brought it, bitch! I brought
it, set it down on the table and opened
it, bitch!

STAN
Wait a minute. Cartman?!

CARTMAN
Eup.

STAN
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!


KENNY
(Malibu? But how?)

STAN
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't
about the eighteen dollars ticket money
anymore. This is about being able to
hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This
is just like when we got our money back
for BASEketball!

[Cartman's house, day. Cartman dons a Nazi outfit, taking care
to look sharp]

LIANE
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people
showing up in our backyard saying something
about a meeting?

CARTMAN
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for
all the people who loved The Passion
as much as I did.

LIANE
Oh, that's great, sweetie.

CARTMAN
Tell them I'll be down shortly

LIANE
Okay, hon.

CARTMAN
Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht
stillstehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay,
I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding,
Mel Gibson.

[Cartman's backyard. Some people are seated, others chat, others
help themselves to chips and fingerfoods]

MAN 1
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion
meeting?

JACK
No. Actually, we're guests as well.
I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife
Elise.

ELISE
Hello.

MAN 1
I think it's so great that someone took
the initiative to have a meeting like
this.

ELISE
Oh I agree. There are so many of us
who are moved by The Passion. It's a
perfect idea to have us organize so
we can strengthen the Christian community.


MAN 1
And apparently the organizer is just
an eight year old boy who was touched
by the film.

JACK
Leave it to a child to show us all the
way, huh?

SHLOMO
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet
saying if you love The Passion to come
to this meeting, so here I am!

WOMAN 1
It's great that everyone came here to
figure out how to use The Passion to
enrich everyone's lives.

CARTMAN
Ah hello everyone. Achtung.  My name
is Eric Cartman and I'm the President
of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank
you, thank you. I'm happy to see that
all of you.were affected by The Passion
like I was. Now, we all know why we're
here, and I believe we all what needs
to be done.

WOMAN 2
We sure do.

CARTMAN
But, I think it's best we don't talk
out loud about it until we have most
of them on the trains heading to the
camps.

ELISE
Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?


JACK
I'm not sure, but-uh.  Folks, I just
wanna interrupt for a second and say
how remarkable it is that this little
boy brought us all together. The Passion
is causing a revolution of spirituality,
and we owe Mel Gibson and this little
boy our thanks.

CARTMAN
Thank you, thank you very much. Now,
in order to do what we  all know needs
to be done, we are first going to need
more support. I think we should all
go out and take at least one other person
to see The Passion.

MAN 2
Oh, what a great idea! We each make
it our responsibility to convert one
more person!

GUESTS
Heheh great! Yeah! Great idea.

CARTMAN
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing,
if you know what I mean.

SHLOMO
We sure do!

GUESTS
Yeah. All right. Woohoo!

[Mel's Malibu mansion, day. A rusty Beetle rolls up to the front
security gate, stops, and lets out some passengers, then rolls
away. Stan and Kenny remain]

STAN
Thank you.  This must be the place.
Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.


MEL
Yes?

STAN
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this
is Kenny

KENNY
(Hello)

STAN
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion,
and we didn't like it, so, can we have
our money back, please?

MEL
You can't not like The Passion! I just
followed the Bible! Christ died for
you. Go home.

[Mel's mansion, inside]

STAN
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're
not leaving until you give us our money.


MEL
Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find
it first.  But I won't tell you where
I keep my money.  You can torture me
all you want, I still won't tell you!


STAN
Tor-torture you?

MEL
Ha! So you DO intend to torture me,
huh?!  Well go ahead! Do your worst!
You STILL won't get your ticket money
back! I can take whatever you can dish
out!

STAN
We don't want to torture you.

MEL
I get it, but you don't have a choice,
is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure
hope you don't use those whips over
there on the wall!

STAN
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen
dollars back from you?

MEL
I have to use that money to build my
church! I brought the fire and brimstone
back to Christianity with The Passion
and now I'm gonna start my own church!
And do you know why?! So I can play
banjo!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how
I love ya Jesus!

STAN
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!

MEL
How dare you call me crazy! This means
war!

[South Park Church, rectory. Fr. Maxi sits at his desk explaining
things to Kyle]

FR. MAXI
And so it was that God sent his only
son down from heaven, to die for our
sins.

KYLE
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die,
or did Jesus just get kind of screwed
over.

FR. MAXI
...What is troubling you, my child?


KYLE
Well, I have this friend, see? And this
friend belongs to a certain, Chosen
People of Israel. And it ...so happens
that these chosen people killed your
Lord.

FR. MAXI
Ah! You mean he's a Jew!

KYLE
Right. But he can't live with the guilt
anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't
really the Son of God, he was still
a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what
happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie.
I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my...
friend can't sleep at night.

FR. MAXI
Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The
truth is, there's not a whole lot in
the Bible about the Crucifixion. The
Passion was actually done as a performance
piece back in the Middle Ages to incite
people against the Jews.

KYLE
But how can the Jews make it better??


FR. MAXI
Well, if you really care about your
friend's soul, then perhaps show him
the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity
is about... atonement.

KYLE
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.
I know what I have to do now. Thank
you, Father.

[Back at Mel's mansion, Stan and Kenny are still running from
Mel, who's chasing after them in a cartoonish way. Mel passes
a mirror, then gets back to it a second later]

MEL
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would
haul that tanker You wanna get outta
here? Talk to me.

STAN
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait!
There's his wallet!

MEL
Freedom!!!

STAN
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You
got two dollars, Kenny??

MEL
Jesus is Lord!!!

STAN
All right, let's get the hell out of
here!

MEL
When you're a clown, nobody takes you
seriously!

[Outside]

STAN
Run, dude, run!

MEL
K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening,
friends!

[The Bijou, day. A large cross is erected atop the Bijou sign.
A crowd gathers and acclaims it]

CARTMAN
One month ago today, this amazing film
opened in theaters. And now, we proud
few gathere here as a people brought
together by its message!  Fellow fans
of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown
and now, together, we have the power
to change the world!  Now I believe
we should take to the streets and march
in unwavering support of this important
movie!

SHLOMO
What a great idea!

MAN 3
It'll be like a parade!

MAN 4
Good idea!

CARTMAN
And as we march for The Pasion we should
also voice our support! So, when I say
"Es ist Zeit für sauberen," you all
chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."


ELISE
Well, what does that mean, dear?

JACK
Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know,
like in the movie.

SHLOMO
Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.

TOWNSFOLK
Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!

JACK
What was our Aramaic line again?

CARTMAN
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!!


TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

ELISE
Oh huh, this is fun!

CARTMAN
All right, everyone! Forward, march!
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

TOWNSFOLK
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

CARTMAN
Nice.

[A synagogue. A service is going on, and the synagogue is full]


RABBI
Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of
our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski,
has asked if he could speak to the congragation.


KYLE
Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United
States officially issued an apology
to the African American community for
slavery. In 1956, Germany officially
apologized for World War II AND the
Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004,
the Jewish community needs to apologize
for the death of Jesus.

MAN 5
What?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Whatwhatwhaaat?!

KYLE
If we as a people choose not to believe
that Jesus is the Son of God, then we
can still apologize for the brutal way
in which he was killed, and take our
share of the responsibility for it.


MAN 6
Oh my God!

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into
you?!

KYLE
I saw The Passion.

MAN 7
Oh no! The Passion?!

MAN 8
This proves the anti-Semitic effect
that movie is having!

MAN 9
Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.


MAN 10
Stereotyping Jews is terrible.

WOMAN 3
Something must be done to stop that
movie!

RABBI
Now, now, everyone calm down. We live
in a rational community, and everyone
knows this is just a movie. There's
no cause for alarm.

MOB
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

MOB
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

MOB
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

CARTMAN
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

[The southwest, desert territory. A tour bus heads east, with
Stan and Kenny riding inside]

STAN
Well it looks like with these bus tickets
we spend about eighty... seven dollars
getting our money back from Mel Gibson.
But I think it's the principle of the
thing that matters.

KENNY
(Yeah. And the truth.)

STAN
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.


MEL
Give me back my money!

STAN
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude,
you've gotta speed up.

DRIVER
Huh?

STAN
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've
gotta go faster.

DRIVER
Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and
stop playing games.

STAN
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is
right behind you and he's gonna-


DRIVER
What the hell?

MEL
HAAAA! K'PLAAAH!

DRIVER
Hey! That's Mel Gibson!

STAN
Yeah. I told you that!

DRIVER
Well, what the hell does he want?!


STAN
He wouldn't give us our money back for
The Passion, so we kinda took it.


DRIVER
You didn't like The Passion? But it
shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel
Gibson is a very spiritual man.

[The Bijou, night. The synagogue's congregation moves quickly
down the street towards the theater]

KYLE
Both you guys, stop! Please. You're
gonna make people hate us more.

SHLOMO
Can I help you?

RABBI
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!
You must remove it from your theater!


CONGREGANTS
That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!


SHLOMO
Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!


MAN 11
We demand you stop showing it!

CONGREGANTS
Yeah! Yeah!

KYLE
Nonono! Don't become an angry mob!
The last time we did that we killed
Jesus!

CARTMAN
Juden!

JACK
What's going on here?

SHLOMO
They're trying to have The Passion pulled
from the theater.

RABBI
This film is anti-Semitic and it must
be stopped!

MAN 1
Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and
spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic
about it!

ELISE
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in
Christ.

RABBI
It's made one of our little Jewish boys
want to apologize for the death of Jesus!


JACK
Well, maybe you should apologize.

MOB
That's right! What he said.

WOMAN 4
How dare you?!

KYLE
Look out!!

MEL
Give me my eighteen dollars!

CARTMAN
Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer!
You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I
have assembled the masses! We are ready
to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good
boy, Mr. Gibson?!

MEL
Hhha!  So! You boys have led me here
to your secret base, huh? I guess now
you're gonna start torturing me! Well!
Oh, my nipples are so tender! Ddon't
squeeze them anymore!

SHLOMO
That's... Mel Gibson?

JACK
H-he's not... quite as eloquent as I
had pictured.

MEL
Yeah...  Well. I guess you wanna torture
me now, don't you?!

KYLE
Dude, what's wrong with him?

STAN
He's kookoo, dude. He's absolutely out
of his mind.

MEL
You! You would all love to torture me,
wouldn't you?  Okay, fine. See what
you can fit in there, I can take it!


KYLE
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole
time because of THAT guy's movie?


MEL
Fine! If nobody here is man enough
to torture me, then just give me my
eighteen dollars!

STAN
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie
sucked!

MEL
You can't say my movie sucked, or else
you're saying Christianity sucked!


STAN
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian,
that's cool, but, you should follow
what Jesus taught instead of how he
got killed. Focusing on how he got killed
is what people did in the Dark Ages
and it ends up with really bad results.


JACK
You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't
focus our faith on the torture and execution
of Christ.

SHLOMO
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in
those times. We shouldn't rely on violence
to inspire faith.

CARTMAN
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so
close to completing my final solution!


KYLE
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about
being Jewish now that I see that Mel
Gibson is just a big wacko douche.


MEL
Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo!

"OSAMA BIN LADEN HAS FARTY PANTS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Bus stop, day. The four boys stand at the bus stop waiting for
the bus. Each of them wears a gas mask. The boys are silent.]


KYLE
:	...Remember when life used to be simple
and cool?

CARTMAN
...Not really.

BUTTERS
Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?


STAN
:	Butters, what the hell are you doing?


BUTTERS
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around
bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all
wearing those spooky spaceman masks?


KYLE
These are gas masks, Butters!

STAN
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask,
you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!


BUTTERS
What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get
the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?


STAN
There's nothing you can do except stop
breathing.

BUTTERS
Stop breathin'?

KYLE
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't
breathe.

BUTTERS
Well. Alright, then.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see:
Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next?
A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with
this?!

CARTMAN
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip
Scissors.

OFFICER BARBRADY
These are a weapon!

CARTMAN
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill
people with those?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I'll think of a way. Now move along!


CARTMAN
God-damnit!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Alright, next!  Okay, clear.

[South Park Elenentary, morning. Along with the regular flag
on the flagpole, a larger flag is draped over the front of the
school, covering some second-story windows and the center of
the school sign. Inside, the kids filter into class and drop
off their gas masks along the wall. The door has been fitted
with an industrial lock. Butters enters and locks the door]


TWEEK
Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me!
Oh Christ!  they might - couild get
me.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright class, as some of you may have
heard, the President has asked that
American children all send one dollar
to the children of Afghanistan.  So
I have a list of addresses and we're
goin' to all chip in.

CARTMAN
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those
towelheads!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Eric, the Afghan people need our help!


CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry, but I though we were
at war with these assholes!

WENDY
We're at war with terrorists, fatass,
not with Afghanistan, and the only reason
that you care is that you don't wanna
give up the dollar!

CARTMAN
That dollar buys me a chocolate milk
for lunch! What, do you want me to just
get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now
look, it isn't our fault that terrorists
hate us. We're just kids. We're not
the ones bombing them now, we're- we're
jsut kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff
goin' on in the world, but, we're caught
in the middle. It's not our fault.


WENDY
The Afghan kids are caught in the middle,
too!

CARTMAN
Yes, but they're sand monkeys!

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Alright, children, we are all sending
a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan!
That's it! End of discussion!

CARTMAN
God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!


[Afghanistan, day. Adults mill around as fighter planes fly by
and bomb a few buildings. Two boys enter from the left and face
the camera. They begin to talk in a strange language. Two other
boys appear, and it's apparent these boys are the counterparts
to the boys in South Park. The one who looks overdressed has
a goat. After what sounds like introductions, they move off to
play some basketball at a nearby makeshift ball court. The boy
who was the first to speak gives the ball to his friend, the
second to speak. The friend shoots the basket, but a bomb falls
on the backboard, launching the ball away from the court and
destroying the backboard and pole]

AFGHAN BOYS
:	Awww!

[the Kyle counterpart says something about seeing a film, then
the four move off to their right. They pay for their tickets
and head for the doors. A bomb falls on the theater and blows
it up]

Awww!

[the Stan and Kyle counterparts talk to each other a bit, then
head for a two-story building. They stop at the front door and
a fighter plane drops a bomb on the building. Only the door remains]


Awww!

[The Marsh house, day. The garage has a large flag draping the
door. Inside, on the living room couch. Sharon is lying there
covered with blankets and watching TV. On the floor around the
sofa are bowls, candles, food, and other items. Sharon hasn't
been off that couch in a while.]

REPORTER
Another high-alert status for terrorists
activity this weekend.  The government
said "bad things are likely to happen."
Meanwhile, the world continues to back
down from their support of the United
States  saying that they were really
only kidding to begin with.

STAN
Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.

SHARON
Can huh get th'ere 'or me?

RANDY
Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop
watchin' the news for a little bit?
Shu- Sharon, you've been watching CNN
for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't
you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-shu-sharon?


STAN
Hey, look at what the postman brought
me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!


SHARON
Weh, that's nahice.

STAN
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars
- they must have sent us something cool
in return!  Do you have some scissors
to get this open?

RANDY
Stanely, your mother's a little freaked
out right now. Why don't you go play
with your big brown package from Afghanistan
outside?

STAN
:	Well alright.

RANDY, SHARON
Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!


[The Marsh house, night. Paramedics, fire trucks, the SWAT team,
and the FBI are all there. Two klieg lights shine on the package
as two Hazmat men approach the package. A crowd of residents
looks on. Stan, Cartman and Kenny watch from the front.]

KYLE
Dude, what's going on?

STAN
We got a package from the kids we sent
dollars to. They sent us something back.


HAZMAT MAN
Prelims show negative, sir.

OFFICIAL
Then we're gonna have to blow it!

TWO SWAT MEN
Yes sir!!

TWEEK
AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!

RICHARD
Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee.


OFFICIAL

GOAT
Mma-a-a-a-a-a-a.

STAN
Oh, it's just a goat.

PEOPLE
Oohhh.

BLOND MAN
Look, it's a goat.

MAN 1
Awww.

BRUNET MAN
A precious goat.

GOAT
Ba-a-a-a-a.

STAN
Hey there, little guy.

OFFICIAL
Stay away from it! Terrorists could
have given that goat anthrax or smallpox
before sending it over! Johnson!!  Check
the goat for diseases!

JOHNSON
Yes sir!  The goat seems to be clean,
sir!

STAN
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted
to give us something back for giving
them four dollars.

CARTMAN
Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got
ripped off.

OFFICIAL
Alrioght, men, this area is secure.
Let's head out!

KYLE
Well what are we supposed to do with
it?

GOAT
Ba-a-a-a-a.

STAN
:	Yu- you're gonna have to take it home
with you, Kyle.

KYLE
Dude, my mom won't even let me have
a hamster.

STAN
Kenny?

KENNY
(No fuckin' way, dude!)

STAN
My parents will never let me keep a
goat

CARTMAN
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill
it.

STAN
No, we're not gointa kill it, Cartman!
We'll just have to  take the return
address and mail it back to the kids
in Afghanistan. Come on, goat.

GOAT
Ba-a-a-a-a.

[Downtown South Park, night. All building windows have flags
draped behind them, and some of the walls have flags on them
as well. The post office hs two flags on wall-mounted poles.
The last postal worker closes up for the night as the boys approach]


KYLE
Uh oh, they're closing!

STAN
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat
to Afghanistan, please?

POSTMAN
Excuse me?

CARTMAN
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't
stay here, or else it'll choke on the
sweet air of freedom.

KYLE
Yeah.

POSTMAN
Afghanistan?  H-I'm sorry boys, but
our planes aren't flying there.

STAN
They're not.

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a.

POSTMAN
The only planes goin' to Afghanistan
are the military planes over at the
base. I'm sorry.

STAN
Well yeah! The military planes. Come
on, goat, we'll put you on one of them.


KYLE
Stan, I don't think we're supposed
to be in the military base. They might
shoot us.

STAN
I don't care! We're going!

TOWELIE
Don't forget to bring a towel.

THE BOYS
Aaagh!

CARTMAN
Oh no, not Towelie.

TOWELIE
When goin' someplace new, you should
always bring a towel.

STAN
Okay, thanks, Towelie.

TOWELIE
Do you wanna get high?

CARTMAN
No, we don't wanna get high!!

TOWELIE
You mean, you don't want Towelie around?


CARTMAN
That's right!

TOWELIE
So am I to understand that there's been
a ...Towelie ban?...

THE BOYS
Awww!

STAN
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here,
Towelie!

TOWELIE
Alright, see ya.

[The military base, night. Jeeps roll in as a batallion is assembled
in the parking lot. A large cargo plane receives the vehicles
and other cargo]

GENERAL
Alright, troops, we depart for Afghanistan
in five minutes! Let's move out!

STAN
Alright, come on. We just gotta get
the goat on one of these planes.

SOLDIER 1
Isn't this exciting, Tony?  We're finally
gonna see some action.

TONY
Yeah, and uh, I hear that as soon as
we land we get a USO show.

SOLDIER 1
We do!  Stevie Nicks is goin' to perform.


TONY
Hoh, Stevie Nicks. Huh, I love her!


STAN
Okay, it's clear. Come on!

SOLDIER
Hey you!

TONY
What the hell do you think you're doing

GOAT
...Ba-a-a-a-a.

TONY
H-uh, I'm sorry, Miss Nicks, uh.  Hey

SOLDIER 2
Oh wow!

GOAT
...Ma-a-a-a-a.

SOLDIER 3
Uh, can I get a picture

SOLDIER 4
Miss Nicks. Over here, Miss Nicks!


GOAT
...Ma-a-a-a-a.

TONY
Oh... M- Miss Nicks, I... I don't wanna

quick Fleetwood Mac for us. Could ya?


OTHER SOLDIERS
Oh yeah. Please. Come on, come on. Please.
Yeah.

GOAT
...Ma-a-a-a-a. Ma-a-a-a-a.

SOLDIERS
Oh! No way! That was wild! That was
great!

SOLDIER 3
Wait till I tell my sister about this;
she is gonna flip!

STAN
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks
on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.


TONY
Oh, can we just get a-

STAN
Ah, sorry. Mss Nicks isn't answering
any more questions.

TONY
Oh, sure, we understand. Move along.


SOLDIER 3
...She looks great

TONY
She looks great

[Cargo plane, later. The boys walk up to the plane with the goat
and prepare to put in in the cargo hold. A side door is open,
with a ramp leading up to the hold]

STAN
'K, let's put him on here.

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.

STAN
Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be
okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan
in about 20 hours.

CARTMAN
Stan, if you're finished having your
tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd
like to go now, please?

PILOT
Alright, tango clear.

THE BOYS
Waaah!

PILOT
Let's head out.

CARTMAN
Aw, son of a bitch!

KYLE
Hey, wait! There are children in here!


KENNY
(Oh, shit, we're locked in.)

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.

STAN
Dude, looks like we're going tooh...
Afghanistan.

KYLE
Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small
space for 20 hours? How could things
get any worse?

BOYS
Awww!

KENNY
(Ee-hew-hoo!)

CARTMAN
Uh ho, you guys.

[Afghanistan, next day. A cargo plane has landed and the camera
pans from the plane to the runway behind it. Another cargo plane
lands and rolls to a stop. The large cargo door drops down and
the soldiers file out marching]

GENERAL
Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get
your gear ready and report to the barracks
at o-nine hundred!

SOLDIERS
Sir yes sir!

KYLE
Oh God, it was horrible!

STAN
Twenty hours!

KENNY
(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a!

PILOT
What the hell?

KYLE
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath
it in for 20 hours!

CARTMAN
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are
overreacting.

PILOT
I don't smiell any- boh! Oh God!  Hohhgh!
Blagh!  Bleeaagghh

CARTMAN
Uh, whatever!

KYLE
You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't
fart when you're locked in a small space
with other people!

CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask
my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying
tucked away for a while!

STAN
Alright alright, let's just get the
goat back to his home!  We have to find
this address.

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.

[A large city in Afghanistan, day. Could be Kabul. Plenty of
large building and roads abound, but they all look rundown or
beat down - this is a city in decay. The boys walk through the
city]

CARTMAN
God, what a craphole, dude! This is
like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!


KYLE
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from
places like this! If I grew up here,
I'd be pissed off, too!

STAN
Hey look! There's a taxi!

PERFORMER
Haa-aa-aa.

STAN
Hello. We need to go...  here.

CARTMAN
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?


[The home of the Afghan boys. The taxi pulls up and drops the
South Park boys off, then goes away. The boys approach the door]


KYLE
Is this the right house?

STAN
I think so.

AKMARH
Shomot chizimi frushi?

STAN
A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we
sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars?
Yu, you sent us this goat?

AKMARH
Goat?

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.

STAN
Here. Wu-we don't want it.

AKMARH
Oh, you want something alse? All we
had was the goat. Your country bombed
everything else.

STAN
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful.
It's just... none of us can keep the
goat

CARTMAN
It was choking on the sweet air of freedom
in America, so we brought it back to
your crappy country.

STAN
Oh uh, and here.  Take this American
flag as... a gift.

AFGHAN BOYS
Yaaay.

KYLE
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!


STAN
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone
but terrorists love America.

FAT BOY
Huh!

CARTMAN
What did you call us?!

AKMARH
Your country is the evil empire! Your
government wants to rule the world!
But your values and your spirituality
are in the guh-ter!

KYLE
Then why did you send us the goat?


BOY IN BLUE VEST
Because, in Afghanistan, we have pride.
If you send us something, we must send
something in return.

AKMARH
It doesn't mean we don't still hate
you. Now, get out of here!

STAN
Hey! Hey, open the door!

CARTMAN
I told you! Jawas have no heart.

KYLE
Jawas?

CARTMAN
You know, sand people.

STAN
How come they hate America so much?
What the hell did we do?

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.

KYLE
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else
in this craphole hates Americans, we'd
better just leave the goat and get back
to the plane!

STAN
Alright.  Oh look, he's following us.
It's so sad.

CARTMAN
God, I hate you so much, Stan!

STAN
What?  Howdy.

KYLE
Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well
boys, it's aboot time we get to our
hoose in Canada, isn't it?

CARTMAN
Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!
I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and
neither are you!

STAN
Cartman, you stupid asshole!

PROTESTER
...Osama bin Laden!

KYLE
Good job, fatass!

CARTMAN
Dude, don't call me a Canadian!

[A cave in Afghanistan, day. "Not where Osama bin Laden is."
Guards stand outside keeping watch. Inside, six guards interrogate
the boys]

STAN
You've gotta listen to me! We're not
spies!

CARTMAN
Look, I think I can explain everything.
You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive
animal lover. He's got a boner for this
goat, a-

VOICE
Amaar madmallah

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Oooo, alamalamalamalaah.

KYLE
Oh crap, it's him!

GOAT
Ma-a-a-a-a.

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Amalama hamahamahama?  Una HAqa mala


CARTMAN
Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay?
It's not expensive.

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Haqaama hamahalahamahaqa.  U bataqataqaa
maladala. Ameriqa la tabakabaka haka
haqadaqadaqa  Haqahaqa, daaqadaqa!


CAMERAMAN
Aaaaand... cut!

STAN
Dude, these people are insane.

[The Marsh house, night. Sharon has resumed watching SNN on the
sofa]

SNN REPORTER
...as more and more case of terrorist-related
AIDS continues to grow. And this just
in: the Taliban has apparently taken
American civilians as hostages. The
Taliban has just released this videotape
, in which it is clearly visible that
they have indeed captured  Steivie Nicks.
Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits,
though her whereabouts are unknown.


RANDY
Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen
Stan in the last couple... days?

SHARON
Yes. I just saw him.

RANDY
Oh okay.

[Afghanistan, day. The general and his troops are watching the
same report]

SNN REPORTER
With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the
other members of Fleetwood Mac have
been hidden so the Taliban can't get
to them as well.

TONY
They... took Stevie Nicks?

SOLDIER 2
Bastards! Heartless, gutless bastards!


GENERAL
Alright men! Grab your guns and your
Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks
back!

SOLDIERS
Hooray!!!

[The Afghan boys' home, at that moment]

SNN REPORTER
:	The Taliban's video also shows what
appears to be four American children
in captivity, though they could just
be French.

AKMARH
We have to help them.

FAT BOY
Do you say??

AKMARH
They are not espies. They came to give
us our goat back.

BOY IN BLUE VEST
Screw them! They are evil Americans!


AKMARH
I know! But if we don't help the innocent
ones, then we are no better than the
Americans are.

FAT BOY
Help the Americans? That doesn't make
sense.

AKMARH
Dude, we are espeaking English right
now. Does that make sense??

BOY IN BLUE VEST
:	Alright, let's go.

FAT BOY
Ehhh lohhh nuts!

[Osama's cave, day. Inside, at table, the Taliban guards are
celebrating Osama's birthday. The guards and Osama wear party
hats]

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Aw, jihad, jihad.  Oh?  Oh, oh! Ameriqa
haqa haqa! Dursha! Dapadapadapa!  Hulagugla
hugagugahagahaa!

[Outside Osama's cave, day. The American and Taliban forces engage
each other in combat.]

[Inside Osama's cave. Osama is still giving orders]

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Qubada durqaana Ameriqanab! Qubada durqaana-


STAN
Hey, what are you guys doing here?


OSAMA BIN LADEN
-alabalabaa

BOY IN BLUE VEST
Shh. We've come to save you.

KYLE
But I thought you hate us.

BOY IN BLUE VEST
We do.

KYLE
Cartman, where are you going??

CARTMAN
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!


KYLE
Cartman, he's crazy!

CARTMAN
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know
how to deal with these people.

OSAMA BIN LADEN
.A flippity flappity floop! Jihad jihad!


CARTMAN
Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Arrrrrrrrrrrubadubaduba! Durbadurba

CARTMAN
Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah,
m'heh

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Taba haqa??  Allah allah allah, allah
hakadurrpa durpa adurpa hagalah

CARTMAN
Uh oh! Mmm-mm!

[Outside Osama's cave, day. The American and Taliban forces are
still fighting. The seven kids and the goat emerge from the cave]


AKMARH
We will have to be quick! The Americans
are attacking!

KYLE
Where do we go?

AKMARH
Get down!

BOY IN BLUE VEST
Oh Allah, Qosaiqe bono!

AKMARH
Tol dayoos!  You... murdering Americaaans!!


STAN
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start
this war.

AKMARH
America DID eh-start this war! They
eh-started it YEARS ago, when they put
their military bases on Muslim holy
lands!

[A forest near the cave, at that moment. Osama bin Laden slinks
around looking for Cartman. He stops next to a small bush. As
bin Laden looks around the bush skittles away, then stops. Bin
Laden sees the bush has moved and growls at it, aims his rifle,
and walks up to it - four steps. The bush moves again, then stops.
Bin Laden catches up in three steps. The bush moves again, then
bin Laden tales a step forward. The bush moves again, then bin
Laden tales another step forward. The bush leaps and bin Laden
holds it in mid-air as Cartman drops to the ground. We get a
view of the gun on Cartman's face from Cartman's perspective]


OSAMA BIN LADEN
Ramadan!

CARTMAN
Hey look! An infidel!

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Wuut? Peitoqaba!

CARTMAN
So that's what this is all about?

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Ishta fatwa open sesame!

CARTMAN
Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass
of a chicken!

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Proila foqabam!

CARTMAN
Woohoo!

[Outside Osama's cave, day. The fighting continues. Amid the
fighting, the general crosses the battlefield.]

GENERAL
We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!


GOAT
Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!

[Outside Osama's cave, day. The South Park boys line up opposite
the Afghan boys. Stan faces Akmarh, Kyle faces the boy in blue
vest.]

KYLE
All right, I've had just about enough
of this! They told us in school, and
on TV, that most people in Pakistan
and Afghanistan like America.

BOY IN BLUE VEST
And you believe it? It is not just the
Taliban that hates America. Over a third
of the world hates America!

STAN
But why? Why does a third of the world
hate us?

BOY IN BLUE VEST
Because, you don't realize that a third
of the world hates you!!!

STAN
:	 ...That doesn't make sense. You guys
are just buttholes!

AKMARH
You're butt-holes!

STAN, KYLE
You're buttholes!

[Outside Osama's cave, day. Osama and Cartman are now out in
the open desert. Osama resumes slinking around]

FEMALE VOICE
Youhoo.

[it's Cartman seated on a camel, dressed in a purple chador.
Bin laden takes one look and he goes nuts over what he sees.
His eyes bug out as he goes horizontal ]

CARTMAN
Haduqaduqaduqa.  Huqadukadukadukaduuu.


OSAMA BIN LADEN
Oh bella, bella falafel.

Mi amore. Fatwa, fatwa. [Cartman holds up a sign with a screw
and a baseball on it, then puts it away. Bin Laden hops away,
then returns with a table, two chairs, two glasses and some wine,
and sets up a table for two. He sets the camel down on one chair
and sits on the other one opposite the camel. He then serves
up some glasses of wine]

[Outside Osama's cave, day. The boys have moved away from the
cave entrance, and the fat Afghan boy has rejoined them. Beyond
them the two forces continue fighting]

KYLE
Do you really think your civilization
is better than ours?! You people play
games by killing animals, and oppress
women!

BOY IN BLUE VEST
It's better than a civilization that
spends its time watching millionaires
walk down the red carpet at the Emmys!


STAN
...He's got us there, dude.

TONY
I got her. I got Stevie Nicks.

GOAT
Me-e-e-eh.

[Nearby... Osama's grinning widely at the camel. Cartman walks
up in a different costume - that of the fussy movie director.]


CARTMAN
There you are! Where have you been?
We have another anti-American video
to create!

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Oh, dapidiuta ako.

CARTMAN
Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry
up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look
marvelous, dahling.

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Haqa hamahama.

CARTMAN
Come on! The cameras are ready!  Alright,
there we go. Let's roll cameras.  Oh,
and here's your microphone.

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Ogh. America adirqadirqa-  Uh ohhh.


GENERAL
We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!


SOLDIERS
Hoorayyy!!

KYLE
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take
care of them.

OSAMA BIN LADEN
Terrorists is the craziest peoples.
Eheeee!

SOLDIER
I got him! I got him!

BOY IN BLUE VEST
Well, it looks like the Taliban and
bin Laden are finally out of power.


AKMARH
Yeup, you don't need us anymore.

STAN
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys
should know one thing.  Most people
in America are good people. We just
try to live day by day, like you guys
do. Maybe if you took some time to see
all the great things about our country,
you'd see... we're not so different
after all.

KYLE
Yeah.

BOY IN BLUE VEST
That's fine. But we still hate you.


STAN
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday,
we can learn to... hate you too.

AKMARH
Maybe. In time.

KYLE
I'm confused.

[USO concert. The stage is set amid the pup tents and soldiers
clamor around in the audience. "VICTORY!" The general takes the
stage]

GENERAL
Great job, troops! Once again we have
killed our enemies!

SOLDIER 5
Hooray!

SOLDIER 6
Hooray! Yeah, we sure did!

GENERAL
The world is now safe, thanks to you.
And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood
Mac with Stevie Nicks!

SOLDIERS
Whoa. Yeah.

FLEETWOOD MAC
Just like the wild winged bird sings
a song-

Stand back, she's singin'.

GOAT
Maaa

FLEETWOOD MAC
Baby

GOAT
Maaa

FLEETWOOD MAC
Babe

GOAT
Maa-ha

STAN
Come on, let's go gat to the plane.


KYLE
Dude! I almost thought those Afghani
kids talked you into not liking America.


STAN
No, dude. America may have some problems,
but it's our home. Our team. And if
you don't wanna root for your team,
then you should get the hell out of
the stadium.

KYLE
Yeah.

STAN
Go America.

KYLE
Go America.  Go Broncos.

STAN
Yeah, go Broncos.

CARTMAN
Yeah.

"HELEN KELLER, THE MUSICAL"


Written by


Trey Parker





[A stage, rehearsal, day. Stan, Kyle, and Wendy are in costume
on stage. Stan is dressed in a white suit and bowtie, and a fake
beard and moustache. Kyle is dressed as a country doctor with
starched collar, and Wendy is dressed in white pants, purple
coat and beret, and bowtie. The stage itself has a door prop
and a tripod table with a bowl and jar atop it. Kyle enters through
the door.]

WENDY
Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be
okay?

KYLE
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but
I'm afraid your daughter Helen still
cannot see, hear, or speak.

WENDY
Oh no! NO!

STAN
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing
we can do.

WENDY
My poor little Helen.

TIMMY
Timmiihhh!

WENDY
She can't see or hear us, John.

TIMMY
Heh-aaaah, Timmih!

STAN
E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an
asyluh.

CARTMAN
Stan, what the hell is wrong with you?
I can't understand your lines!

STAN
'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.

KYLE
Can we take a lunch break now?

CARTMAN
No! If we want our play to be better
than the kindergartners' play, we have
to rehearse as much as possible! Now
let's continue the scene!

BEBE
Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and
I believe I can teach this child to
communicate.

STAN
Uh-eally? Uh you think so?

BEBE
Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!

TIMMY
Agh oh-ight, Timmih!

CARTMAN
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't
suposed to talk!

BUTTERS
Hey you guys! We got a big problem!


KYLE
What is it, Butters?

BUTTERS
The kidnergartners! I just came from
their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good,
you guys. It's real good!

CARTMAN
How good?

BUTTERS
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian
ones, too! They've got singing and dancing
and boy you've never seen such a show!
Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!


Clyde	Oh, no!

KYLE
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!


CLYDE
Oh, now what?

STAN
Oh yeah, we can't!

CARTMAN
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look,
we still got four days until the Thanksgiving
festival; that's plenty of time to revamp
our play!

KYLE
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth
grade class has to perform the Helen
Keller Story.

CARRTMAN
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had
to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff
and music numbers, too.

CLYDE
Well, we can add music numbers, but
how do we make the Helen Keller story
more Thanksgivingy?

WENDY
I know! How about, instead of a dog,
Helen Keller has a pet turkey.

TOKEN
Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.


KIDS
Yeah

CARTMAN
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan
and Wendy, you go out and find some
musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde,
take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving
decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy,
you go out and find a turkey!

KYLE
Okay!

CARTMAN
This is gonna be the best version of
the Miracle Worker ever!

KIDS
Yay!

[a barn, with no snow around it. Cows are grazing on the grass
outside. Inside, a rancher shows Timmy and Kyle around the barn.]


RANCHER
What kind of turkey are you lookin'
for?

KYLE
A smart one, that can do tricks.

RANCHER
Well, I ain't got a whole lot left,
it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all.
Go ahead, just pick one out.

TIMMY
Timmaay!

RANCHER
Oh, that one's a little messed up.
Not exactly the... pick of the litter.


TIMMY
Haaaaa!

KYLE
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids
with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!


TIMMY
TIMMAY!

RANCHER
Yeah. Best you not take that one. I
was just about to take it out in the
yard and putt a bullet in its head.


KYLE
What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!

TIMMY
T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!

KYLE
Alright, we'll take him. How much?


RANCHER
Fifty bucks.

KYLE
But you were just gonna take it out
in the backyard and put a bullet in
its head!

RANCHER
I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else
to shoot.

KYLE
...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy,
let's go!

RANCHER
I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like,
too.

KYLE
Aw, blow it out your ass!

CARTMAN
Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey
Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert
on musical theater, AND, he played the
lead in Les Misérables at the Denver
Community Playhouse for five weeks.


KIDS
Bravo.

WENDY
Do you think we could make up a good
Thanksgiving play in four days?

JEFFREY MAYNARD
I would swear it on my life. Your play
shall want for nothing.

KIDS
Hooray!

JEFFREY MAYNARD
Now, the first thing a good musical
needs is a big opening number. Something
that sets up the entire show.

CARTMAN
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in
the turkey!  What the hell is that?


KYLE
It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.


TIMMY
GOBBLES!

CARTMAN
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick
performing turkey?

KYLE
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money
on this... one...

TIMMY
GOBBLES!

CARTMAN
Kyle, can I talk to you over here for
a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these
things to me?

KYLE
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw
the turkey and wanted to get it. What
do you want me to say to him?

CARTMAN
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have
that turkey! Bad Timmy!"

KYLE
Look, I know it isn't exactly what
we wanted, but maybe we can train it.


?????
He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole
point was to make our play better than
the kindergartners.

TOKEN
Yeah, that turkey sucks.

JEFFREY MAYNARD
Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving
turkey is what you require? I know of
a turkey.

STAN
You do?

JEFFREY MAYNARD
During my years on Broadway I... worked
with a turkey who could do all kinds
of tricks. She even jumped through a
hoop of fire.

CARTMAN
Cool! Can you get it for us?

JEFFREY MAYNARD
I will go promptly and call her trainer.
On the morrow you shall have your trick
performing turkey.

KIDS
Alright!

[South Park, Timmy's house, night. Timmy is in his room with
a hula hoop in hand, sitting on the floor]

TIMMY
Gobbles!  Gobbles!  Up, heh. Uh!  Heeey,
Gobbles!  Gobbles.  Gobbles!

[South Park, Cartman's house, night. Cartman is in his room rewriting
a part of the play.]

Cartman;	No no no! [tosse another sheet over his shoulder, to
join other wads on the floor. His mother enters the room]

LIANE
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to
be in bed.

CARTMAN
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write
the lyrics for the opening song of our
Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!


LIANE
Now, hon!

CARTMAN
But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these
lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller
can be realized by the common man.


LIANE
Twenty more minutes, and that's it.


CARTMAN
Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom
give him twenty minutes to write the
lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?!
Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.
Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your
spirit through me!

[South Park, Timmy's house. Timmy is in bed asleep. Soon, Gobbles
hops up on the bed and drops his head on the covers. He slowly
inches up to Timmy's face, looking at Timmy all the while, and
settles in next to him. Gobbles soon falls asleep. Timmy's left
hand comes to rest on Gobbles' body. An exterior shot with the
moon low in the sky is shown and fades out.]

[The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, next day. rehearsal.
Clyde is speaking under a spotlight]

CLYDE
Tonight we present the story of a courageous
girl and her fight against depression


CARTMAN
OP-pression!

CLYDE
Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler
time.  Alabama, in the late 1800's


ACTORS
1800's, Alabama! What a great place
and time!

We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny
and there is no crime!

JEFFREY
Now to the refrain!

ACTORS
And in this little town in 1800's Alabama
there's a family by the name of Keller!


[They dance off to one side of the house. A water pump appears]


Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents
can't even tell her!!

LAMOND
Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal
trainer.

CLYDE
Oh.  Cool! He's here!

CARTMAN
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can
do tricks?

LAMOND
Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's
a very sensitive turkey! She performs
feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the most beautiful bird
in America!  Four-time prize winner
of the National Western Stock Show and
reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com!
I give you Alinicia!

CARTMAN
Yeh.

OTHERS
Wow.

CARTMAN
Whoa.

BEBE
Her feathers are beautiful.

Clyde	That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.

LAMOND
Of course she is!

CARTMAN
Okay! Now we can really get this thing
underway! Places, everybody!  Where
the hell is Timmy?

TIMMY
TIM-MIH!

LAMOND
What... is... that?!

CARTMAN
Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged
turkey.

TIMMY
Gobbles!  Gobbles?!

KYLE
Timmy, we already got a turkey.

CLYDE
Yeah, and it's from Broadway.

TIMMY
Gobbles.

CARTMAN
No, Timmy! Tha handicapped turkey does
not go in our play!

KYLE
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only
kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't
piss him off.

CARTMAN
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the
part.

TIMMY
Tim-mih.

CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller
can have TWO pet turkeys!

LAMOND
My turkey does not work with other turkeys!


CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonnan
do?!

[The South Park Community Theatre, later. Hallway outside a dressing
room. The door opens and Lamond stands there trying to calm Alinicia
down]

LAMOND
Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright.
Alright.

CARTMAN
Dude, we need your turkey for our play!


LAMOND
She's not coming out. She's very upset!
She's pooped all over the room!

CARTMAN
I know, I know, but listen: uhlet me
try to explain the position I'm in here.
The retarded turkey belongs to our friend,
Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who
knows the part of Helen Keller. So,
so tell me what I can do here to make
everybody happy?

LAMOND
Kill the other turkey!

CARTMAN
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for
it.

LAMOND
Well, it could meet with "an unfortunate
accident."

CARTMAN
Unfortunate accident? You mean, like
Geena Davis getting her own TV show?
Oh.

LAMOND
It's very simple! Either that turkay
meets with an unfortunate accident,
or you don't have a feat-performing
turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving
musical!

CARTMAN
Alright, alright! Just get your turkey
to stop crapping all over the dressing
room and come out for rehearsal! I'll
take care of everything.

[The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, later. Bebe and
Timmy are front and center while the others stand in a row in
the background]

BEBE
Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why
can't you understand?

TIMMY
Dehh haaa.

BEBE
Water, Helen, Water.

KIDS
She's never gonna do it. There's no
way she'll ever do it.

BEBE
Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.

KIDS
How can she talk if she can't hear?
This is absolutely pointless!

CARTMAN
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it
right there a second.  Okay, I just
want to adjust the blocking real quick.
Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have
Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more
over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little
more up in here.  And just a wee bit
over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.
There we go. Good.

STAN
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!

JEFFREY
Whoa-aaaa

CARTMAN
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong
light!

JEFFREY
Let him rest in peace. Let him rest.
Why must he die?

BUTTERS
They've got special effects!

KYLE
What Butters?

BUTTERS
The kindergartners! They've got amazing
stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what
have yous. Why, it's a regular feast
for the eyes!

WENDY
Oh, no!

CLYDE
We're never gonna outdo them now!


TOKEN
But what are we gonna do?

CARTMAN
Calm down! Calm down! We can have special
effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going
wrong, but we've got to stick together
to make this play work!  All of us!


JEFFREY
and into your hands  uh he... buh...


[The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, later. Timmy is
in another hallway trying to get Gobbles to hop through the hoop]


TIMMY
Gobbles!  Hu-ugh, Gobbles!

LAMOND
Little boy.

TIMMY
Timmy.

LAMOND
Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you.
The others, well, they don't want you
to know, but, oh, I don't know what
to do. Should I tell you?

TIMMY
T-Timmih?

LAMOND
I feel I'm the only one who can be honest
with you.  The animal shelter is on
its way to...take your turkeyy away from
you.

TIMMY
Gobbles?

LAMOND
You see, they don't allow children in
your... situation... to have wild animals
as pets. You can't take him running,
you can't take care of him. They... have
to take it away.

TIMMY
Gobbles!

LAMOND
They take wild pets away from people
like you... and hand them over for experiments.
And they're shocked, dissected, and
falyed while thery're still alive. And
no matter where you go, the shelter
people will find you. The only way for
that turkey to avoid years of torture
is for you to... let him go. Back into
the wild.  Oh no! Here they come now!
Quick, go! And set your turkey free!
I'll try to stall them.

TIMMY
T-tim-mih.

INSTALLER
Eh, excuse me, we're here to install
the water effects for the musical?


LAMOND
Uh, the stage is right through there.


INSTALLER
Thanks.

[South Park, Cartman's house, night. Cartman is at his desk in
his room rewriting a song.]

CARTMAN
Alright, got to write the new lyrics.
Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit


JEFFREY
How is it going, Eric?

CARTMAN
Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics
for the third act! Nothing's coming
to me.

JEFFREY
Well, you know in theater sometimes,
we try different tricks to get the creative
juices flowing.

CARTMAN
Like what?

JEFFREY
Let's see.  Helen Keller was blind and
deaf.  Perhaps you should see what it
is like. Deprive yourself of your senses
and see what plays inside your mind.
Here.

CARTMAN
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

JEFFREY
Just relax. Just try to let your mind
wander and let the juices flow...

[First, the portrait of Helem Keller. Then nothng. Then Helen
Keller again, then a banana split, then Helen again, then a human
skull. Cartman is disturbed. Then Helen, the skull, another skull,
Helen, a mummy whose hair moves a bit, bombs dropping from planes,
a sinister clown, the banana split, a body being prepped for
opeartion, the banana split, a wall with "GO DEAD BE DEAD" written
in blood on it, a Russian show of military might, Helen, animals
tearing at something, a riot, a close-up of a snake, an atomic
bomb test, a lasik experiment. Cartman. The first skull, "GO
DEAD BE DEAD", the skull, the experiment, the skull, the experiment,
a woman wailing in the flames, open-heart surgery, a rat eating
a dead rat, the banana split, a mouth being pulled open, Helen,
a Nazi troop march, a fireman in an inferno, the Hindenberg bursting
in flame, an alien opening its mouth and the camera zooms in...
Cartman takes the blindfold and headphones off]

CARTMAN
Oh, man!

JEFFREY
Well, did you see anything?

CARTMAN
No, just the same old crap I always
see when I close my eyes.

JEFFREY
...Oh, that's too bad.

CARTMAN
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup
for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps
through the hoop of fire!  Yes! Yes!
I have it now!

[South Park, residential street, day. Timmy rolls along dejected
and turns to anothr street. He remembers what Lamond said as
he rolls]

LAMOND
The only way for that turkey to avoid
years of torture is for you to... let
him go...  let him go... let him go...

TIMMY
Gobbles!  Gobbles!!  Gobbles. Gobbles!
Timmih.  Timmih, Gobbles.

BOY
Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to
heaven?

FATHER
She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had
no choice.

BOY
But I miss her.

ELDERLY MAN
I could have so much more with my life,
son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it,
not ever telling you and Mark that I
love you.

GIRL
Robby! Robby, no!

WOMAN
...Because now, every time I look at you
, I see her!  I have to move on.

MAN
Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.


KELLY
Then why did you do it??

MAN
I don't know!

LADY
Have you done the right things in your
life?

[The South Park Community Theatre, Wednesday, play day. The parents
arrive and take seats. Mrs. Marsh finds Mrs. Broflovski siiting
in the audience already, and walks up to her]

SHARON
Hi, Sheila.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?


SHARON
Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video
camera so he can tape the performance.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, so did Gerald.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.


RANDY
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we
can make copies of each other's tape
so we have both.

KYLE'S FATHER
Good idea.

[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. The kids mill around
backstage]

KYLE
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing
on the last beat?

STAN
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay.

KYLE
You ready for the big show, Timmy?


STAN
Where's Gobbles, Timmy?

TIMMY
Gobbles.

CARTMAN
Alright everybody, let's take our places!


KYLE
Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?

CARTMAN
I don't know.  I don't know, you guys!
Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's
turkey crushed by a stage light, but
I didn't do anything else. I'm not an
asshole.

LAMOND
You're going to be brilliant, you sexy,
gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling
animal out of the way, you'll steal
the show!

[South Park, business district, day. Gobbles walks along the
curb as cars zip by, then decides to cross the street. A car
zips be and Gobbles steps back. The camera angle shows Gobbles'
view of the car that almost ran over him]

DRIVER
Well, well, what are doing out here?
You shouldn't be out walking the streets.


[Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey truck, trailer section. Gobbles finds
himself along near the doors and looks up to see a group of turkeys
looking back at him. Then the turkeys look up, and Gobbles does
also. What they see is a sign that reads, "Thanksgiving Turkey.
Killed Humanely." Gobbles looks at the turkeys, who look back,
and then drops his head]

[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Mr. Garrison is present
to introduce the show.]

MR. GARRISON
Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th
annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Every year the fourth graders do "The
Miracle Worker," and every year I have
to sit and watch it.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it
one more time, I'd put a bullet in my
head.  But luckily I got really stoned
before I came.

MR. GARRISON
And now, here it is. The touching story
of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker."


KIDS
Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as
a bat.

She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?

KYLE'S MOTHER
This is "The Miracle Worker"?

SHARON
I... well... maybe.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, oh, haha. Wow.

WRANGLER
Come on. Yaah! Move it!

[the turkeys leave the room and enter another one. A movie screen
faces them. Another worker appears and closes the door behind
the turkeys. The turkeys remain excited until a movie comes up
with sweeping views of nature. The turkeys calm down, and a view
of clouds zipping along the sky follows. Then waterfalls. The
lights come up and a giant saw comes out and chops the heads
off all the turkeys save one. The saw rises. Only Gobbles survives,
and he keeps his head low as he finds a clearing. A large board
appears and pushes the decapitated turkeys out an opening on
the opposite wall. The bodies are then lifted up and returned
to the truck they came in, but the building they come out of
is 3C. Gobbles falls off the truck and ends up on the floor.
Jimbo and other South Park hunters pass by and notice]

JIMBO
Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild
turkey!  It's tryin' to outsmart us!
Come on, fellas!

[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. The audience watches
as Wendy]

WENDY
John, come quick! Our little baby's
very sick

[Stan rushes in]

When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an
inch.

STAN
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring
me.

WENDY
She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!


STAN
Helen!

WENDY
...Helen!

I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!

STAN
Oh no!

WENDY
Oh no! Oh no!!!

[The South Park Community Theatre, backstage. Timmy and Lamond
watch Alinicia perform.]

LAMOND
She's brilliant! Everyone loves her
so far.

CARTMAN
Hey, the fountains you guys installed
are shorting out some of our lights.


INSTALLER
Look, we're only here to do the water
effects. We're not in charge of electrical.
That's a different union.

TIMMY
Timmih?

CARTMAN
Union Mafia bastards!

LAMOND
Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love
and theatre, right? Haha.

TIMMY
Gobbles!!

[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Cartman rushes up to
the other kids]

Cartman	Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!

KYLE
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw
him leave.

CARTMAN
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows
the part of Helen Keller!

JEFFREY
I do. I know the part. If I must, I
can go on.

CARTMAN
...Alright, fine! Get in costume!

[South Park, business district, day. Timmy wheels down the street
past Tele's calling out...]

TIMMY
Gobbles! Gobbles!

[The barn. Gobbles returns to his prior home, and the hunters
follow him there]

JIMBO
There it is!  Hey, hey! I saw it first!
I get the first shot!  Here, turkey
turkey.

[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Stan, Kyle, Wendy,
and Jeffrey are in costume]

WENDY
There is nothing we can do for our poor
daughter. We cannot reach her.

JEFFREY
I cannot hear what they are saying.
I cannot tell them how I feel.

CARTMAN
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller
isn't supposed to sing!

JEFFREY
If only I could say things that go on
in my mind.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Oh, wow.

[The barn. Jimbo still has Gobbles in his sights]

JIMBO
That's it. Thaaat's it!

TIMMY
Gobbles!

JIMBO
Gotcha!

TIMMY
Gobbles!  T-timmih?  Gobbles?  Gobbles!
Haaaah.

JIMBO
Aw, thank God you're alright, kid.
It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is
there any way we can make it up to you?


TIMMY
Timmih.

[The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Bebe, and Jeffrey are
in costume. Bebe pumps water onto Jeffrey's hand]

BEBE
Yes, that's it.  That's it, Helen. Water!
WA-TER!

JEFFREY
Wawa.

BEBE
She did it!

KIDS
She did it! She did it! Water! Water
water aaaaaaaa!

Water, Helen, Water.

We can't believe she did it.The dumb kid really did it.

Water, Helen, Water.

JEFFREY
Now that I can communicate the world
is not so cold and dark.

KIDS

[slowing]

Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!

[the waterworks go up real high and two fountainheads crash into
each other]

LAMOND
Here it comes, angel! Your big finale!
The audience is going to go wild!  Oh.
Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered
your part flawlessly.

TIMMY
Timmih!

JIMBO
Turkey shoot!

LAMOND
Alinicia! Jesus, no!

TIMMY
Aaaa, Timmih!

CARTMAN
Okay, we're ready for the-  What the
hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed
to be the big finale where the turkey
jumps through the ring of fire!

KYLE
Hey, look!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA

STAN
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters.
Who'd you think we were talkin' about?


BUTTERS
We-ell hold on a second, you guys.


CARTMAN
Hey, I know how we get the balls on
Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks
down the street! They're always making
crasy masks and special effects for
their dumb movies.

BUTTERS
Hang on now.

KYLE
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set
of balls. Come on, Butters!

BUTTERS
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??


STAN
It has to be you, Butters. Think about
it.

CARTMAN
Yeah.

BUTTERS
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish,

BUTTERS
I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh,

STAN
Kenny woulda done it.

BUTTERS
...So? I told you guys before:  I'm
not Kenny.

KYLE
We know. Believe me, we know. We're
reminded every day that you're not Kenny
because Kenny... was cool.

CARTMAN
Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive.
He'd put balls on his chin. He was such
an awesome friend.

STAN
Well, come on guys. If Butters won't
even put his balls on his chin for us,
I guess we know where we stand.

CARTMAN
Yeah.

BUTTERS
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my
mom and dad won't find out?

[The Trekkers' place down the street, next day. The two Trekkers
work on Butters]

BRUNET TREKKER
Now, we're going to apply the latex
with some spearmint gum.

BUTTERS
Hey that spearmint gum sure is stinky.


STAN
Where's you get the balls from?

BRUNET TREKKER
We made a plastic mold of his chin,
and then made a latex scrotum and put
two golf balls inside.

CARTMAN
Nice.

BLOND TREKKER
Now we just blend the skin tones, add
a little hair,  and presto!

STAN
Wow!

KYLE
That looks awesome!

BUTTERS
Aw, I feel silly.

CARTMAN
They look great on you, Butters. They

Star Wars: Episode I

BRUNET TREKKER

BUTTERS
Oh they, they do, huh?

MAN WITH NO LIMBS
We don't take kindly to that.

BUTTERS
Well I can certainly see why.

MAN WITH NO LIMBS
It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore.
Not after what they saw what we did
to Lobster Boy.

BUTTERS
Lobster Boy?

MAN WITH NO LIMBS
Lying sack of crap.

BUTTERS
What?

Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake

Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.

MAURY
So, is it tough being ...different?


BUTTERS
Uhhh, yeah.

MAURY
And do all the kids at school make fun
of you?

BUTTERS
They sure do. They always say to me,
"Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never
said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would
do this and Kenny would do that-

CARTMAN
Uh oh, we're losin' him.

BUTTERS
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?!
Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh
deal with it.

MAURY
Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make
fun of you because of your condition?


BUTTERS
Uh what condition?

You have balls that hang off your chin.


BUTTERS
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I

golf course in the world"?

MAURY

CARTMAN
Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?

Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!

OPERATOR
Really?  Is your mother in tears every
day over how disobedient you are?


CARTMAN

Does she worry about you doing drugs
and having sex at such a young age?


CARTMAN
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot
pourri, and queazies

OPERATOR
Well that's great! If you can get your
mom to come in with you, we'd love to
fly you out.

men for baking. Cartman enters with his hands clasped behind
his back]

CARTMAN
Mmoooomm?

LIANE

CARTMAN
Could yo do me a favor?

LIANE

CARTMAN
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich

control and do drugs and have sex so
that I can go to the largest putt-putt
gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?

LIANE
Hmmm. but you're not out of control,

a wonderful mother.

LIANE
Sweetie, don't.

CARTMAN
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a

[Butters' house. He's back from New York and his parents have
apparently heard about the show. Chris has his arms folded in
front of him]

Just what did you think you were doing,
Butters? Not only did you lie to us
and say you were on a camping trip with
Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself
AND us on national television!

BUTTERS
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost
kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go
on TV with balls on my chin again.


CHRIS
Ugh! You'd better believe you won't,

LINDA
Your father and I have to leave now
to visit Grandma in the hospital, but

chin and march right up to your room!


BUTTERS

BUTTERS
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my

[the screen behind them spuuters and changes. The Maury Povich
logo disappears]

MAURY
What the hell is this?

ELEPHANT MAN
A lot of decent hard-working freaks
in America are losing their talk-show
jobs to freaks of a different nature.
Sure, everyone in this great country
of hours is a freak, but true, physically
deformed freaks must be recognized,
for it's these real freaks that make
you all feel better about yourselves
for not being one. So next time you're
watching television, make sure it's
a show with "freak" freaks, and not
just with people that are freaks because
they're stupid trailer trash from the
South. That's what we mean when we say,
"Look for the True Freak label"

[four freaks join in] When you are watching a TV talk show

[a side shot of more freaks streaming their way to the box] Remember
somewhere,

[a shot of the audience] our union's growing

[a front shot of the freaks walking in] Our wages going to feed
the kids.

[a front shot of more freaks walking in] And run the house-


We work hard, but who's complaining?

[a zoom-out shot as the freaks crowd in around Butters] With
TFU we're making our way!

[a pan shot] So always look for the True Freak label,

[a full crowd shot] Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
[the Maury Povich logo is restored]

MAURY
Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there,
heh. Anyway-

MAN
They're right. We should have never
crossed that picket line. Come on, honey.


MAURY
Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can
make the other out-of-control kids take...
their clothes off, too!

CARTMAN
Whatevah! I'll crap in my... pants!


CAMERAMAN
Sir, the ratings have just started to
plummet.

MAURY
Ah, those damned freaks!

[Outside the Maury Povich studio. A door opens and Maury steps
out. The freaks stop and wait]

MAURY
I gave you shoes! And groceries! And
this is how you repay me?!  Very well.
Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate!


BUTTERS
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can
get back home.

CARTMAN
Butters, you have screwed me out of
a prize for the last time!

BUTTERS
Oh. Double hamburgers.

CARTMAN
Aaahh!

BUTTERS
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay
for me this time.

CHRIS
Butters!

BUTTERS
Oh I know.

"GOOBACKS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. There
are two lanes on either side of the highway, with a grass median
in between. A Snacky Cakes truck rolls by. Tumbleweeds begin
to roll. A few seconds later, the highway sign begins to shake
violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to
the right and more lightning is seen until a sphere of energy
with a doorway appears. More tumbleweeds roll by. A flash of
light follows, and an alien steps forth from the sphere. He looks
around and mumbles something. He walks towards the highway, looking
around all the while. A car comes up quick on him and he freezes
in the headlights for a while, then jumps out of the way as a
Busy Beavers Moving Company truck barrels past him. A car comes
up on him on the other side of the highway. He gets up quickly
and steps out of the way. Traffic picks up and the alien dodges
all the vehicles until a car almost runs him over. The car brakes
and tips him over.]

[South Park, next day. The boys approach a house, which has more
snow on it than usual in South Park, especially along the windows.
Indeed, looks like the town has just had a snow storm overnight.
Each of the boys carries a shovel. Stan rings the bell. A woman
answers.]

WOMAN
Yes?

CARTMAN
Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town
and offering snow-shoveling service.
Would you like your driveway and sidewalk
shoveled for eight thousand dollars?


WOMAN
Oh well, I certainly could use some
little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand
dollars seems a little steep. How about
ten dollars?

CARTMAN
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of
that tight grip you have on my balls!
Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls,
ma'am!

WOMAN
How about fifteen dollars?

CARTMAN
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's
get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally
awesome. Craig crapped his pants when
he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin'
on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.
No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is
so weak.  What?

KYLE
You've been on your fucking phone since
we started!

CARTMAN
Dude, I'm takin' a break.

KYLE
A break from what?! You haven't done
anything!

CARTMAN
Kyle, how many times do we have to go
through this? I'm the negotiator. I
negotiate our price with the customers.


KYLE
All you ever do is talk about your balls!


CARTMAN
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just
get us an extra five bucks?

KYLE
If you want your share of the money,
then you're gonna shovel snow like the
rest of us!

CARTMAN
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin'
Jew! I will kick your ass!

[Moments later the doorbell rings again. This time the camera
is in the house looking at the door from an angle. The woman
approaches and opens the door. The boys are shown, with Cartman
keeping his now-bloody nose from oozing any more blood]

STAN
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?


WOMAN
Oh goodness, what happened?

CARTMAN
Shoveling accident.

WOMAN
Oooh no, come on inside.  Wait right
here, I'll be right back.

CARTMAN
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder,
Kyle, or I'd totally let you have it.


STAN
Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.


NEWS ANNOUNCER
This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman
Aaron Brown.

AARON BROWN
Incredible, absolutely amazing news
today. A man from the future has come
back in time and is in a government
hospital after being hit by a car.


STAN
Whoa.

AARON BROWN
Christina Naylon has more.

CHRISTINA NAYLON
The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts
and scientists have been with the man
from the future for several hours now,
and have been able to learn that he
is from the year 3045. His condition
is stable, and speculation continues
as to why he has come. Has he come to
deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix
something wrong with the past?

AARON BROWN
Have to interrupt you there, Christina.
Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the
base with breaking news. Brad?

BRAD MORGAN
Aaron, the scientists have been able
to communicate further and have uncovered
that the man from one thousand years
in the future has come to our time...
looking for work. Now, uh he has said
that the future is so overwhelmingly
overpopulated that there are simply
no jobs in his time, and so he built
a time portal and has come back to 21st
century America, uh to find a job here.


AARON BROWN
Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He
came back here for work?

BRAD MORGAN
Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi-his plan
is to get a job here, in our time, so
that he can put the money he earns into
a savings account, uh, which will earn
interest, and by the year 3045 be worth
billions of dollars, uh which of course
in the future will be worth only hundres
of dollars, but uh enough, he says,
to feed his family.

AARON BROWN
And now I understand we're going to
Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation
on how the time portal works. Harrison?


HARRISON MOORE
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border
which scientists say follow Terminator
rules. That is, it's one way only and
you can't go back. This is in contrast,
say, to Back To The Future rules, where
back and forth is possible, and of course,
Timerider rules, which are just plain
silly. Anyway, it appears that the man
from the future is here to stay.

[Later, Stan returns home. He enters with his shovel]

STAN
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a
man from the future!

RANDY
We know, Stanley. We've been watching.


AARON BROWN
If you're just joining us, a man from
over two thousand years into the future
has come through a one-way time portal
looking for work. Uh, the President
is expected to give an announcement
at any time.

HARRISON MOORE
Breaking news here at the time portal,
Aaron. It appears that another person
from the future has just arrived!  It
looks as if the job at Wendy's did work
for the original immigrant; this second
arrivee claims that man's family is
now much better off, and wishes the
same for his family.

[Stan's house, night. Sharon puts Stan to bed and tucks him in.]


SHARON
There you go. All set, sweetie?

STAN
Mom, can we go try to see the people
from the future? I have a bunch of questions
I wanna ask 'em.

SHARON
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's
pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you
just get some sleep.  You've had a busy
day.  Goodnight, sweetie.

STAN
Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the
future. How cool.

[Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The
highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with
lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is
seen until it reaches the portal. A flash of light follows, and
an alien steps forth from the sphere. Another flash brings forth
another alien. Another flash brings forth a third alien. Another
flash brings forth his wife, another flash brings forth their
daughter, and another flash brings forth their son. Another flash
brings forth another alien. They head for the highway, which
is busy now. They all make their way across, avoiding being struck
as they cross the lanes]

[South Park, day. The boys once agani make their rounds as shovelers
and stop at a house. Stan rings the doorbell, the door opens,
and a different woman greets them]

WOMAN 2
Yes?

STAN
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling
service again today?

MRS. LANDIS
Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've
already hired someone else to do it.


CARTMAN
What?? Who??

MRS. LANDIS
One of those immigrants from the future.
He said he would do it for twenty-five
cents.

KYLE
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even
worth it.

STAN
All right guys, come on. Let's go to
the next house.

KYLE
Dude.

STAN
Son of a bitch!

[CNN News Brief. An image of a family from the future is shown,
with the caption above reading "Time Immigrants"]

AARON BROWN
Still more immigrants from the future
arrived at the time border today, some
even bringing their entire families.
the purplish goo that they have on their
bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic
side effect of the time-travel process.
This is all giving scientists a great
opportunity to learn even more about
American life in the future. Chris Holt
joins us now. Chris?

CHRIS HOLT
Yes, there are incredible things we're
learning about Americans in the future,
Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future,
Americans have evolved into a hairless
uniform mix of all races. They are all
one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish
whitish color. Uh it seems race is no
longer an issue in the future, because
all ethnicities have mixed into one.
Perhaps most interesting is how this
has affected their language. The people
in the future speak a complete mix of
English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed,
all world languages, which sounds something
like this:  Back to you, Aaron.

AARON BROWN
Apparently the people from the future
are having a pretty easy time finding
work. Since they offer to work for such
low wages, they're being hired all over
America.

[A meeting has assembled somewhere. Two flags hang from the back
of the meeting room, one of them American, the other of Colorado.
Men from all walks of life argue amongst themselves]

MAN 1
This is bullcrap! I ain't standin'
for this!

MAN 2
All right, folks, my name is Darryl
Weathers and I'm with the Construction
Workers' Union. I work with a lot of
fine men who have families to feed.
Now I don't know about you all, but
we worked long and hard to get our pay
up to a level where we could make a
decent living. And now these people
from the future are showin' up and offerin'
to do the same work for next to nothin'!
They took our jobs!!

MAN 3
We're in the moving business! Fourteen
years we've been workin' our butts off!
Now these future folk come in and we
can't get work nowhere! They took our
jobs!

MAN 4
They took your jobs!

MAN 5
Well what about us in the fast-food
business?! The restaurants are firing
us 'cause the future people work for
a lot less! They took our jobs!!

OTHER MEN
They took your jobs!

STAN
It's affecting kids too! Me and my
friends started our own snow-shoveling
business. We were trying to be responsible
and make money, you know? But then the
people came along and, and now we're
out of work too!  Oh, they took our
jobs!!

OTHER MEN
They took yer jobs!!

[Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The
highway sign is shown, but the camera pulls back to show a new
CAUTION sign showing an entire family crossing. The signs begin
to sway back and forth violently and crackle with lightning.
The portal is shown, but now it expands so the people from the
future swarm into the present en masse.]

[South Park, night. At Stan's house, Rand and Sharion are at
the sofa reading. Sharon reads a book, Randy reads the paper.
Stan enters from the front. Sharon spots him]

SHARON
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock.
Where have you been?

STAN
I was at a rally to protest all the
immigrants from the future coming in
and tryin' tuh-

SHARON
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down
in the basement and our son is home.
Could you please set the table for dinner?


STAN
Who is that?

RANDY
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd.
She's gonna help around the house on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll
do it for ten cents an hour.

STAN
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks
are taking our jobs!

SHARON
What??

RANDY
Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you
use that time-bashing slur?!

SHARON
Who taught you to talk like that?!


STAN
Well dude, they are taking people's
jobs away.

RANDY
They're only taking the small menial
jobs that nobody else really wants to
do.

STAN
I wanted my job!

RANDY
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand
something: Those people from the future
have had a hard life! Where they come
from is dirty and overpopulated and
poor! You can't even imagine the kind
of depression they come from! So for
us, who have everything sooo good, to
judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?!
Next time you think about calling them
goobacks, you might just wanna stop
for a second and think about how crappy
the future really is!

SHARON
That's right! We're not raising our
son to be an ignorant timecist.

STAN
Timecist?

SHARON
You know, a racist, but against people
from the-

STAN
People from the future. Right, got it.


RANDY
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat
some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.


[The O'Reilly Factor]

ANNOUNCER
And now, here is Bill O'- Reilly.

BILL O'REILLY
Welcome welcome to the No-Spin Zone,
all right? And what we're talkin' about
today are the immigrants from the future.
All right? Now, most people are more
than happy to give a helping hand to
these people who obviously need it.
All right? But others are starting to
say that the time portal should be closed
off. All right? Now, I've got two guests
with me tonight who have opposing views
on the matter. On my right is pissed-off
white-trash redneck conservative.


DARRYL WEATHERS
Thanks for having me, Bill.

BILL O'REILLY
And on my left is aging hippie liberal
douche.

DOUCHE
Hello.

BILL O'REILLY
Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we
shouldn't allow anyone else through
the time portal, aright?

DARRYL WEATHERS
You're Goddamned right! These people
from the future are takin' all the work
away from us decent present-day Americans!
They took our jobs!

SKYNARD MAN
They took our jobs!

DARRYL WEATHERS
Those jobs belong to people from the
present!

BILL O'REILLY
Aright. What say you, aging hippie liberal
douche

DOUCHE
Heh it's typical for conservatives rednecks
like these to view the immigrants as
the problem, heh, but really, the problem
is America. It is our greedy multinational
corporations that keep everyone else
in poverty. Your ancestors came to America
as immigrants. What right do you have
to turn these people away?

BILL O'REILLY
Aright, redneck, your rebuttal?

DARRYL WEATHERS
They took our jobs!

SKYNARD MAN
They took our jobs!

STOUT MAN
Too-kourderb!

[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings and the students
are in their seats. So are a lot of new immigrant students]


MR. GARRISON
All right, children, the school board
has mandated that I must now teach class
in both present-day English and Futurespeak.


KYLE
What?!

MR. GARRISON
So, with that in mind, let's continue
our lessons on verbs. Remember that
there are transitive verbs such as
"The boy threw the red ball," which
in Futurespeak of course, is  Everyone
say it with me?  Aaand there are intransitive
verbs, such as  "The 11:15 bus from
Denver arrived twelve hours late." Or
in Futurespeak, "Vvut."

THE KIDS
"Vvut."

KYLE
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If
they wanna live in our time, then they
should learn our language!

CRAIG
Yeah!

STAN
That's right!

DOUCHE
Hey now, these immigrants have a right
to retain their culture. Who are we
to say our language is best? They deserve
to have an education just as much as
you do.

MR. GARRISON
Thank you, aging hippie liberal douche.


DOUCHE
You betcha.

TIMMY
Timmih.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, now let's get back to it, kids.
What kind of verb is this?  "The sad
girl puts balls in her mouth." Or, in
Futurespeak of course, "Gluch gligh
balls glych gligh."

[Back at the meeting room, the unemployed men gather for another
rally against the immigrants from the future.]

MAN A
This is bullcrap!

DARRYL WEATHERS
Listen up, everybody! We've just received
a reply from our congressman.  "Dear
intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with
you all losing your jobs. However, we
feel your solution of shooting everyone
who crosses the time border is inhumane."


MAN B
What? That's ridiculous!

MAN C
They can't do that!

MAN D
That was a good idea!

DARRYL WEATHERS
So it appears the government ain't gonna
help us! Which means we gotta take matters
into our own hands! The only way to
stop people from the future is to stop
the future from happening!

MAN 3
Hey that's right! If there is no future,
then there'll be no people from the
future to come back and take our jobs!


MAN 6
Take rjurbs

DARRYL WEATHERS
All right! So, any ideas how we can
stop the future from happening?

CHET
How about we cause more global warming,
so that in the future, the polar ice
caps melt, and and it ushers in a new
ice age?

DARRYL WEATHERS
How the hell is global warming gonna
cause an ice age?!

CHET
Well you know, the... global warming
could bring on like a climate shift
or somethin'?

DARRYL WEATHERS
Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you
know that?! Even if global warming were
real, which all proven scientific data
shows it isn't, it would take millions
of years for a climate shift to happen!
You think an ice age can just happen
all of a sudden-like?

CHET
Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.


DARRYL WEATHERS
Well help yourself to a fuckin' science
book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin'
retard! Now, come on people, we've got
to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!


MEN
They took our jobs!

[South Park, day. The boys walk down the commercial district
noticing immigrants from time to time. Various immigrants greet
them and try to sell them fruits, but the boys walk on. A hovering
futuristic car comes up next to them, sets down, and bounces
the front end up and down like a lowrider. The driver then activates
the hydraulics and the car begins to dance. The boys just look
in wonder as the car settles down and then moves off. Its exhaust
hits the boys' faces and they cough. Next, the boys head for
a Wendell's Burgers restaurant. They enter and head for the counter]


KYLE
Aw, dude.

CASHIER
Gaur da'ka?

STAN
Can you speak in present-day English
please?

CASHIER
Uh oh... Can I help... you?

STAN
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger
and fries.

CASHIER
Chicken sandwich?

STAN
No, a double cheeseburger and fries!


CASHIER
A cheeg- fry?

STAN
What?!

CASHIER
A cheeg- fry?

CARTMAN
We can't understand you, asshole!


MANAGER
Can I help you?

STAN
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!


MANAGER
Chicken sandwich?

STAN
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I
want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some
Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!


RANDY
Stan Marsh!

STAN
Aw-awwww.

[Back at the rally...]

DARRYL WEATHERS
Come on, people, think! How are we gonna
stop these immigrants from takin' our
jobs!

MAN 3
Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should
all take off all our clothes, scramble
into a big pile and start gettin' gay
with each other.

CHET
Did you say "get gay"?

DARRYL WEATHERS
Hey yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!


MAN 7
What? Gettin' gay?

DARRYL WEATHERS
Think about it: These people are from
the future, right? Well, if we can git
everyone to turn queer, then there won't
be no children to have no children,
and the people from the future won't
exist to take our jobs!

JIMBO
I ain't turnin' queer.

DARRYL WEATHERS
You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't
be able to stop them! They too 'r jaobs!


MAN 2
Yeah, they took our jobs!

MAN 8
Took our jobs!

DARRYL WEATHERS
Let's go over to that part of town
that all the future people moved into
and start humpin' each other until they
disappear! Come on!  Come on! You want
your jobs back or not?!

[Welcome to Little Future. This part of South Park is congested
and built upwards. Parts of it are rundown. The drivers there
all drive hovercars. Some kids dance around on a stoop as adults
walk by]

DARRYL WEATHERS
All right, you future bastards! Think
you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll
show you! Come'ere, Earl!.  How do you
like that, gooback?!  Come on, you guys!
Everyone who believes in America, join
in with us! We're gonna make these future
bastards nonexistent!

[South Park Center for Seismic Activity. Randy arrives for work
with Stan in tow]

STAN
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to
go to work with you?

RANDY
Because you're being grounded, Stanley!
Now I don't wanna hear another word
out of your intolerant mouth!  You just
sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk
about what you've done!

BOSS
You'll find all the copiers and printers
in the next room over and then uh-


RANDY
Hey, Mr. Nelson.

MR. NELSON
Oh... R-Randy... Uh I'm surprised to
see you here.

RANDY
Why? This is my office.

MR. NELSON
Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message?
Ooo, this is awkward. Well, the thing
is, Randy, you've been- replaced.


RANDY
What?

MR. NELSON
Well we found an immigrant from the
future who knows geology and he offered
to work for next to nothing. Uh, this
is Mr. Glughgogawk.

MR. GLUGHGOGAWK
Gheglo.

RANDY
You can't be serious.

MR. NELSON
I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just, with
all the budget cuts and all, we'll give
you some tmie to clean out your desk.
Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show
you to the copy room.

RANDY
Oh my God. They took my jarb!!

STAN
They took yer jarb!!

[CNN Breaking News]

ANNOUNCER
This is CNN.

AARON BROWN
Breaking news at the time border. We
go now live to Harrison Moore.

HARRISON MOORE
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border
where some kind of mass protest has
broken out.  Hundreds of men who have
lost their jobs to time immigrants are
here having sex with one another.  These
men have apparently sucked and screwed
their way across the state and are now
here at the time border trying to get
national attention. These unemployed
men have been having sex for several
days. Joining me is their spokesperson,
Randy Marsh.  Mr. Marsh, what exactly
are you trying to accomplish?

RANDY
We're doing the only thing we can do.
If our government is just gonna let
anybody into our time who wants to come,
then we have to take matters into our
own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone
gay so that there are no future humans!
Present-day America Number One!

DARRYL WEATHERS
Yeah America!

MAN 8
Take our jobs!

HARRISON MOORE
Do you really think you can get enough
people to turn gay to destroy the future
of humanity?

RANDY
All we can do is try, Harrison.

DOUCHE
Trying to stop immigration is intolerant
and ignorant. Those immigrants have
a right to pursue happiness.

HARRISON MOORE
Young man, what do you think about
all this?

STAN
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks
because they're no different from us.
They're just humans trying to make
their lives better. Look, it sucks that
the immigrants' time is so crappy, but
the cold hard truth is that if we let
them all come back to our time, then
it's just gonna make our time crappy
too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to
stop the future from happening, but
making the future better.

MAN 9
Huh?

STAN
I mean, maybe if we all commit right
now to working toward a better future,
then, then the future won't be so bad,
and, these immigrants won't need to
come back here looking for work.

MAN 10
Hey. He's right. If we build for a
better future, the immigrants will stay
there.

MAN 11
Yeah. We've got to start working towards
a brighter tomorrow.

RANDY
Well what are we waiting for?

[Montage of green living. First scene is a group of men planting
trees. Next scene is a group of people at a recycling center

we've got to join hands for tomorrow.


Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you

We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children


Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins
with you and me.

CARTMAN
Look, it's working!

SINGER
The future begins with you and me.


DARRYL WEATHERS
The immigrants are fadin' away!

STAN
We're doing it!

[Next scene shows the townfolk cleaning up a meadow. Next scene

panels on the Marshes' roof. Last scene has the townsfolk tilling

we've got to join hands for tomorrow.


Take the first step and you will see the future-

STAN
Dude, wait wait ho, hold on. Wait a
second.  This is gay.

KYLE
This is really gay.

CARTMAN
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the
men getting in a big pile and having
sex with each other.

STAN
Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back
in the pile.

DARRYL WEATHERS
Back in the pile everyone!

RANDY
We're going back to the pile.

Jump in!

"CARTMAN JOINS NAMBLA"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Kneey's house, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sit around
a Monopoly-type board game in Kenny's room]

CARTMAN
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing
card!  You can deny it, or cover it
up.

STAN
Dude, I don't understand this game at
all.

CARTMAN
It's "Investigative Reports with Bill
Curtis" funtime game. You have to decide
if you deny it or cover it up.

STAN
Um, deny it?

CARTMAN
Okay, let's see what Bill Curtis says.


ELECTRONIC HEAD
Hello, I'm Bill Curtis. Many believe
that the U.S. Government... covered it
up. I'm Bill Curtis.

KYLE
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you...
a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.


STAN
Sweet.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you...
AIDS!

KYLE
What?

CARTMAN
I just gave you AIDS.

KYLE
AIDS?!

STAN
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle
AIDS.

CARTMAN
Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns
and 800 points.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about
having another baby. Wouldn't you like
to have another brother or sister?


KENNY
(No.)

STUART
We just might get workin' on it later
tonight, huh huh huh.

CARTMAN
God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family
is already on welfare, and now they're
gonna bring another kid into the world.
Poor people are turning out babies,
adding to the overpopulation, and they're
expecting me to pay for it with my tax
dollars.

STAN
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman!
You're eight!

CARTMAN
...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've
been talkin' about! I can't even relate
to you guys anymore because you're too
immature!

KYLE
What?

CARTMAN
I've gotta start hanging out with friends
that are a little more intelligent,
and understand ...politics and stuff.
It's just that... I'm up on this level
up here , and all my friends are down
here .

KYLE
You don't know what you're talking about,
fatass!

CARTMAN
Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!
 maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.
SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME.


ELECTRONIC HEAD
I'm Bill Curtis.

[Cartman's house, a few minutes later. Cartman paces the floor
in his room. Next to him is a computer]

CARTMAN
I've outgrown all my friends. I need
to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.
Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can
meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's
a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys"
That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am
a young boy seeking an older male for
good times. I am eight years old and
would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys
who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.
Hi Tony.  "So what are you into?"
Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.
"Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?"
Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking,
smiley, face.  "Meet me at Mel's Buffet
restaurant tomorrow morning."  Sounds
good. See you then! Clown hat, curly
hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde
Frog? Tomorrow I'm gaonna meet my first
mature friend!

[Mel's Buffet, next day. Cartman enters and approaches a man
seated alone in a booth.]

CARTMAN
Hi, are you Tony?

TONY
Yeah. You're -Eric?

CARTMAN
Yeah!

TONY
I brought you some candy.

CARTMAN
Wow, cool!

TONY
And some books on Kama Sutra.

CARTMAN
Neato! Having older friends kicks ass,
uh! You see, I've, I've really been
having a tough time. I've kind of matured
faster than my other friends ; we don't
really relate anymore, and, and uh,
alright uh, all my friends seem so childish
now.

TONY
Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?


CARTMAN
Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks.


AGENT
Hold it right there, scumbag!

TONY
Huh?

CARTMAN
Huh?

AGENT
We monitored your little online chat.
Now you're coming with us!

TONY
No!

CARTMAN
What the hell just happened?

[Kenny's house, early morn. Kenny's tossing in bed, apparently
in a nightmare. His dreams are shown, and in each a parent carries
a baby]

MOM
You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save
food for the baby.

DAD
Your mom and I are going out for a few
weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.


MOM
Kenny, you have to change the baby's
diapers!

DAD
You have to share your room with the
baby!

MOM
The baby.

DAD
The baby!

MOM
The baby!!

KENNY
(HAAAAAAAAGH!)

[Kenny's house, living room sofa, later. Stuart is still trying
to get his wife in the mood]

MRS. MCCORMICK
Stop it!

STUART
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant
again.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Oh, alright.

KENNY
(Dad, I wanna play catch.)

STUART
Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later,
son.

KENNY
(But I wanna play now!)

MRS. MCCORMICK
Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.


STUART
Aw, alright.

[Kenny's house, front lawn. Kenny stands in the driveway and
Stuart stands in front of the tattered sofa]

STUART
Well alright, here comes a pop fly.
See if you can catch it!  Good job.
Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh!


MRS. MCCORMICK
What happened?!

STUART
Aw, he smacked me in the balls!

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

[Cartman's house, day. He's back at the computer in his room]


CARTMAN
Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone.
I am a young boy looking for fun times
with older male. I like to-  Oh, this
one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.
"Hi. I'm eight and a hal inches." Damn,
dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a
dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in
being friends with midgets. Midgets
piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see,
how about this one?

[The South Park docks, day. Cartman walks towards the end, where
a man in trench coat and baseball cap looks out over the water.]


CARTMAN
Mister Hammerhead?

MR. HAMMERHEAD
Hi there.

CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison??

MR. GARRISON
Haah! Eric!

CARTMAN
You wanna be my friend?

MR. GARRISON
Oh, crap!

CARTMAN
That's cool, we can hang out. What do
you wanna do first?

MR. GARRISON
Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing!

AGENT
Alright, scumbag, we got you!

MR. GARRISON
Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys
came. This... little boy was trying to
have his way with me.

AGENT
Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little
online chatnow, you're coming with
us!

MR. GARRISON
No-o!

CARTMAN
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting
all my friends? This has to be the work
of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those
guys!

[South Park Clinic, day. Stan and Kyle stand before a picture
window.]

KYLE
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis
machines.  Old people have to hook themselves
into it with a tube, and it sucks all
their body fluids out.

STAN
Oh, man, that's terrible.

KYLE
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against
the glass like this.  Waaaaah!

STAN
Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.

KYLE
Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.

STAN
Blaaa-lalalalalalala.

CARTMAN
Alright, just what the hell do you
guys think you're doing?!

STAN
We're making faces at sick people.


CARTMAN
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?!
Why are all my mature adult friends
being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?!


STAN
We don't know.

CARTMAN
I'll tell you why! Because you guys
are jealous and can't handle the fact
that you're immature, and so you've
started a government conspiracy against
me!

KYLE
We don't know what you're talking about,
lardbutt.

CARTMAN
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly,
I guess I was wrong about you guys,
huh?!

STAN
You're not more mature than us, Cartman!


CARTMAN
YES I AM!!

[South Park Police Department, day. Mr. Garrison and Tony are
in the cell, and Officer Barbrady sits at a desk with his feet
up]

MR. GARRISON
I'm telling you, this is all a terrible
mistake, Officer Barbrady.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you
here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr.
Complainy Pants.

MR. GARRISON
O-ogh!

TONY
Do you like having your back rubbed.


MR. GARRISON
Eat me, pervert!

TONY
Okay.

MAN
We demand you release these men at once!


OFFICER BARBRADY
Who are you?

MAN
We are NAMBLA, the North American Man
Boy Love Association, and we heard about
these political prisoners you're keeping?


OFFICER BARBRADY
Political prisoners? No, these are child
molesters.

MAN
Loving young boys has been around since
the time of the Romans, pal! There's
nothing wrong with it! We are an organization
dedicated to showing that sex between
a man and a young boy can be a beautiful
thing!

OTHER NAMBLA MEN
Yeah, uh-huh.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but
these men aren't going anywhere until
I hear from the FBI.

MAN
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!

OTHER NAMBLA MEN
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay people , I think you'd better move
along before I arrest more of you!


MAN
All these men wanted was to love a young
boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!


MR. GARRISON
I did not want love from a young boy!
I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean,
I like women! What did I say?-Oh God!
I love titties!

MAN
You haven't heard the last of us, officer!
Together we are strong.  Come on, men!


OFFICER BARBRADY
Wow, they've got activists for everything
these days.

[South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch, night. Dr. Mephesto and
Kevin are at a lab table]

DR. MEPHESTO
I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully
spliced this chipmunk with a piece of
provolone chese.  Do you know what this
means, Kevin? No more will the world
have to look in two different places
for squirrels and provolone cheese.
No more will mankind have to pick-
Who could that be?  Why, it's little
Eric Cartman.

CARTMAN
Dr. Mephesto, I need help.

DR. MEPHESTO
Well of course, come in.

CARTMAN
You see, unfortunately I have matured
faster than all my friends. I wanna
hang out with older friends, but I can't
find any, so I was wondering if you
could genetically engineer some older
friends for me.

DR. MEPHESTO
Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that
simple. Genetic engineering has not
yet evolved to the state where I can
just make people.

CARTMAN
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older
guys!

DR. MEPHESTO
Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of
an organization that can help you. It's
called, NAMBLA.

CARTMAN
NAMBLA?

DR. MEPHESTO
Yes. I have been a member for several
years. I'm sure they'd let you join.
You l-look about right.

CARTMAN
Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!

DR. MEPHESTO
Sure!

[South Park Inn. "No Vacancy" "Welcome NAMBLA." Inside, the NAMBLA
leader speaks to the group in a meeting room. On either side
of him are portraits of men with boys on their laps. More picture
line the walls]

MAN
Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know,
hn hn, we continue to be discriminated
against. Recently, the FBI has started
to arrest men, who are doing nothing
more than trying to start a sexual relationship
with a young boy.

MEMBERS
Awwww.

NAMBLA LEADER
And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals
and womens are protected under civil-rights
laws,  we want the same!

MEMBERS
Yeah.

EAGER MAN
Yeh-hehah-hah.

NAMBLA LEADER
What we need is proof that young boys
want to be members of NAMBLA. That they
want love from us. We need a poster
child, to show the world that it is
a beautiful and wonderful thing and
a-  Can we... help you?

CARTMAN
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization.
Is that cool?

NAMBLA LEADER
You... do?

CARTMAN
Sure.

NAMBLA LEADER
Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.


CARTMAN
...Sweet.

[South Park Clinic, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny stand before the
picture window. Stan and Kyle make blow faces again. The patients
are dismayed. Kenny soon makes a blow face. His parents walk
up]

MRS. MCCORMICK
Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it.
I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little
brother or sister.

KENNY
(No!!)

MRS. MCCORMICK
Yup, it's for sure!

STUART
And he fixed my shattered left testicle,
too!

MRS. MCCORMICK
Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need
to start movin' stuff out of your room.


KYLE
Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.

STAN
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?


KENNY
(I don't know. But I've gotta think
of something.)

CARTMAN
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah
nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you
gu-uys didn't!

KYLE
What are you talking about, fatass?


CARTMAN
Oh, no big deal. I just found a group
called NAMBLA with adult members, and
they all think that I'm sure mature
they want me to be their new poster
child is all.  It looks like I'm finally
gonna have mature friends who I can
relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah
nyah nyah!

[South Park Pharmacy, day. Inside, a young blonde girl approaches
the counter.]

PHARMACIST
Can I help you, young lady?

KENNY
(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after
abortion-)

PHARMACIST
Oh, you want some morning-after abortion
pills. Well, they're right over there.


KENNY
(Thanks.)

PHARMACIST
Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't
sell that to you without permission
from your parents.

I Hereby

Give My

Daughter

Permission to

Abort her Baby.

- Mother

[he puts down the note] Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?


KENNY
(Cash.)

[Kenny's house, day. Kenny's in the kitchen mixing a drink. It
consists of cocoa, vodka, ...and the entire bottle of "Pregnant
No More" pills. All 999 of them. In a mug. He finishes, drops
down, and heads for the living room]

[Kenny's house, living room. Stuart reads the paper, and Mrs.McCormick
is knitting. Kenny enters with the mug]

KENNY
(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.)


MRS. MCCORMICK
Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny.
You made my favorite drink for me.


KENNY
(Here.)

MRS. MCCORMICK
But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant,
I can't drink.

KENNY
(What?)

STUART
Well, I can still drink.

KENNY
(No! Daddy!)

STUART
Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget
all about my shattered balls.  What?
Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you
go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.


MRS. MCCORMICK
What's the matter?

KENNY
(Uh oh.)

STUART
Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants!


[Kenny's house, bathroom. A sign saying "CRAPPER SWEET CRAPPER"
hangs on the wall. Stuart drops his pants and briefs, hops on
the toilet, and starts crapping]

STUART
Oohhh, God!  Oooh, my balls!  Ooh, God


[Photo-Dojo, day. Members of NAMBLA surround the photographer
as he takes pictures.]

NAMBLA MEMBER
Just a few more pictures, Eric. You
make a perfect posture child.

CARTMAN
Thanks, dude.

NAMBLA LEADER
Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for
you. We want to have a big dinner and
dance honoring you as our new poster
child.

CARTMAN
Really? Awesome!

NAMBLA LEADER
Yes, and and we you to um... invite all
your young male friends.

CARTMAN
Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends
who want to be mature,  excluding Stan
and Kyle, of course.

NAMBLA LEADER
Great, hnn. You go invite your little
friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.


CARTMAN
KIIICK ASS!

[Kenny's house, day. Kenny's on the sofa watching television.]


MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your
room so we can paint it for the baby.


ANNOUNCER
Hey, are you feeling down? You need
some excitement. And North Park Funland
has just opened its newest ride! The
John Denver Experience!  You'll be Rocky
Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME,
INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT.

TWO GUYS
It was-

GUY 1
-fun.

GUY 2
-fun.

ANNOUNCER
Note: people with heart conditions and
expectant mothers should not ride the
JOHN DENVER! Opne now! Come on down!


KENNY
(Mom!)

[North Park Funland, day. People file in. The McCormicks are
in line to go on the John Denver Experience]

STUART
Are you sure you should be going on
this thing?

MRS. MCCORMICK
Oh, it's all right.  You know, I thnk
maybe Kenny's been a little worried
about the new baby. We have to show
him that he's still our little boy.


OPERATOR
Folks, please keep your hands and arms
inside the John Denver Experience at
all times. There's no sense in trying
to unloop at the latch at any time during
the ride here at the John Denver Experience.
Have fun.

STUART
What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience.


[North Park Funland, John Denver Experience exit. Riders exit.
The McCormicks are the last ones out]

STUART
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my
nose!

MRS. MCCORMICK
Come on, Stuart, let's just get you
to a bathroom.

STUART
Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna
be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my
nose!  Augh!

[South Park, day. Cartman runs into the boys in front of the
South Park Clinic]

CARTMAN
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted
to see! My NAMBLA organization is having
a very important benefit in my honor.


KYLE
They are?

CARTMAN
We're gonna have a big, mature party
at this hotel, and I can invite all
my mature friends that I want. And that
means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except
for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!

STAN
We don't wanna go to some stupid adult
meeting anyway!

CARTMAN
Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't
go.

KYLE
We don't wanna go!

CARTMAN
You can't go.

KYLE
We don't WANNA go!

CARTMAN
No, you CAN'T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters,
check this out

STAN
Dude, maybe we do need to start being
more mature.

KYLE
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into
that club, too.

[Kenny's house, day. He is asleep again in his room. Another
nightmare appears. The scene is a delivery room at Hell's Pass
Hospital. Kenny's mom is about to give birth, and Dr. Doctor
is there with a nurse and Stuart]

DR. DOCTOR
You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick.  It's
alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle
of life.

KENNY
(Eeww.)

DR. DOCTOR
I can see its head!

MS. MCCORMICK
You can?

DR. DOCTOR
Push, now. Push hard!  Oh my God.


MS. MCCORMICK
What is it??

DR. DOCTOR
It's ali-

STUART
Oh my God, it killed Kenny!

MS.MCCORMICK
Bad baby, bad!

KENNY
(Huh. Huh??)  (That does it!)

[Kenny's house, living room. Mrs. McCormick is reading a book
when Kenny enters with he plunger]

MRS. MCCORMICK
Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh
what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what
are you going to plunge?

KENNY
(AAAARRRRHHH!)

MRS. MCCORMICK
Aaaaaaah!  AAAAA!

STUART
Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!


[South Park Inn, day. Schmaltzy music plays as the camera looks
at a large sign that says "I LOVE NAMBLA HONORARY DINNER" and
has a picture of Eric posing under a spotlight at its center.
Present in the ballroom are Cartman, Butters, several other boys,
and the men they've partnered up with. The doors open and in
walk Stan and Kyle, with their partners.]

CARTMAN
What the hell?  Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?! This is for
mature people only!

STAN
We got invited too, fatass

CARTMAN
Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they
allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.


NAMBLA LEADER
Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great
to see you all here. It seems like we
have finally found a city that won't
oppress us.

NAMBLA Member	Oh, yeah. [others cheer]

NAMBLA LEADER
First and foremost, I wanna recognize
Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch
with all of you pretty, young boys.


CARTMAN
Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank
you.

NAMBLA LEADER
Now, I know that many of us have already
found partners in this fahine city,
and I'd like to take a minute to hear
some testimonials from members.

STAN
This is boring.

KYLE
Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO
SOME ACTION, HUH?

MEMBER 1
Ho hohohoho

MEMBER 2
Woohoohoohoohoo.

NAMBLA LEADER
Ho, goodness! What a gift from God!
Aha ha, we'll... "get" ...to it very soon,
I assure you. But first, I'd just like
to hear from a couple of you on your
progress. Uh yes, Patrick.

PATRICK
Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old
named Buttehers. He's a beautiful ,
bright, little boy.

BUTTERS
Well, uh I sure am, I guess.

PATRICK
And his skin is as soft as fresh linen.


STAN
That seems kind of... weird.

PATRICK
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft,
I suppose.

NAMBLA LEADER
Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you,
Mr. Harris?

MR. HARRIS
Well, I want to announce that I may
have found the dream boy of the decade.
He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk.
His name is Timmy.

TIMMY
TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?

NAMBLA LEADER
Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager
to get acquainted with our new partners
and, so why don't we turn down the lights
and start to dance!

LEAD AGENT
Alright, I want those perverted bastards
all taken in. Got it?

AGENTS
Got it!

MEPHESTO
Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South
Park representative-

LEAD AGENT
Hold it right there!

AGENT 1
Freeze!

AGENT 2
Don't nobody move!

MEPHESTO
What's going on?

LEAD AGENT
Alright, sickos. Where are the children?!


MEPHESTO
What children?

LEAD AGENT
This... is... NAMBLA, right?

MEPHESTO
Yes.

LEAD AGENT
The North American Man/Boy Love Association?


MEPHESTO
What? No!  We're the North American
Marlon Brando Look-Alikes.

BLOND AGENT
Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA.


MR. GARRISON
Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place.


MEPHESTO
Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA
is actually in South Park?!

LEAD AGENT
You know of them?

BLOND MEMBER
Know of them? We've been fighting with
them for years over the rights to nambla.com!


BRUNET MEMBER
Yeah, those perverted bastards!

BLOND AGENT
Wow. You guys really do look a lot like
Marlon Brando.

MEPHESTO
Thank you. Now, let's go get those othe
NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any
of South Park's children!

MEMBERS
Yeah! Yeah!

BLACK MEMBER
And let's kick their asses for stealin'
our domain name!

MEMBERS
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[South Park Inn, evening. NAMBLA members and their boys are still
dancing. The NAMBLA leader stpes up to the podium]

NAMBLA LEADER
Alright, members, that's enough of
that.  It's time for all of us to retire
to our respective rooms, and get to
know our new young boys.

MEMBER 3
All right.

MEMBER 4
Alright.

KYLE
Dude. Being mature is boring!

STAN
Yeah.

NAMBLA LEADER
Everyone come up and grab your room
keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm.


[South Park Inn, upstairs. French music begins to play, and the
men and boys appear at the top of the stairs and go to their
respective rooms. After a few moments...]

THE BOYS
Aaaaah!

STAN
Dude! I think these guys mean to have
sexual encounters with us!

KYLE
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out
of here!

STAN
Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide!


MEPHESTO
Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got
to be here somewhere. Let's try this
room.

LEAD AGENT
Let's get those perverts!

WAITER
Sacre blue!

THE BOYS
Whoa!

MRS.MCCORMICK
Kenny, no! Leave me alone

KENNY
(Come here, mom! Let me get it!)

STUART
Kenny??

WAITER
Zis time, I will not drop zeh food.
Allo!

NAMBLA LEADER
It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's
the boys?!

WAITER
Sacre bleu!

MEPHESTO
I think the boys went in here.

THE BOYS
Aaaaaah!

TIMMY
Timmih!

NAMBLA LEADER
Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys?


MRS. MCCORMICK
Kenny, GIVE IT UP!

KENNY
(Come on!)

WAITER
Waaah!

LEAD AGENT
Alright, you're under arrest!

MEPHESTO
No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!


LEAD AGENT
Damnit!

AGENT
Hey, we didn't try that room!

WAITER
Sacre bleu.

[South Park Inn, a room. The boys are safe, but tired]

KYLE
Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.


CARTMAN
They're all over the place.

TIMMY
Timmiihhh!

TOKEN
What are we gonna do?!

STAN
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into
this, you have to figure out a way to
get everybody out.

THE BOYS
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how
to get us out.

KYLE
How?

CARTMAN
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going
to rest until they've made love to one
of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna
have to go out there and and... take one
for the team.  And I think, in all fairness,
it should be Butters.

BUTTERS
Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?

CARTMAN
Now, are you a team player or not?!


BUTTERS
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh,
I guess.

CARTMAN
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."


BUTTERS
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out
there and let all those... huhu-horny
old men... have their way with my fragile
person?? Well just what team is this
anyway?!

CARTMAN
Just go, Butters. We're running out
of time.

BUTTERS
Well uuh-uuh-alright then.

CARTMAN
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.

[South Park Inn, hallway. Butters is there all alone]

BUTTERS
Well, alright men. Here, here I come.
I'm ready to take one for the team.


STUART
Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your
shenanigans!

NAMBLA LEADER
Oh, one of the boys just came in.


STUART
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH!


[South Park Inn, outside. The inn has been cleared, so everyone
stands outside. An ambulance awaits a victim, who is soon on
a stretcher]

MRS. MCCORMICK
Are you alright, Stuart?

STUART
Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken,
body poisoned, have been made love to
in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old
menI just wanna go home and take a,
a hot bath!

LEAD AGENT
We've been after you for a long time,
buddy! Do you know your rights?

NAMBLA LEADER
Rights? Does anybody know their rights?
You see, I've learned something today.
Our forefathers came to this country
because... they believed in an idea. An
idea called "freedom." They wanted to
live in a place where a group couldn't
be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where
a person can live the way he chooses
to live.  You see us as being perverted
because we're different from you. People
are afraid of us, because they don't
understand. And sometimes it's easier
to persecute than to understand.


KYLE
Dude. You have sex with children.

NAMBLA LEADER
We are human. Most of us didn't even
choose to be attracted to young boys.
We were born that way. We can't help
the way we are, and if you all can't
understand that, well, then, I guess
you'll just have to put us away.


KYLE
Dude. You have sex with children.


STAN
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality
for everybody, and tolerance, and all
that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.


KYLE
Seriously.

LEAD AGENT
Alright, that's enough. You're all going
to be put away for a long time.

KYLE
Well, Cartman

CARTMAN
Well, what?

KYLE
Don't you think you owe everyone an
apology for bringing NAMBLA here?


THE BOYS
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost
got you guys all raped. There.

STAN
And now, do you still think that you
need to hang out with older, mature
friends?

CARTMAN
No, I guess you guys will blossom into
maturity someday. Just don't take too
long.

PARAMEDIC
Okay, let's roll.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, Delivery Room. Mrs. McCormick has a new
baby in her arms, and Stuart looks at it with her]

NURSE
Dr. Flores, dial 18-

STUART
Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.


MRS. MCCORMICK
Our little angel, yes.

STUART
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been
hard on both of us losing poor Kenny.
But this new baby kind of reminds me
of him.

MRS. MCCORMICK
What should we name him?

STUART
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed
away, maybe we should name him ah,...
Kenny.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little
Kenny, a brand-new Kenny.

STUART
God, this must be the fiftieth time
this has happened.

MRS. MCCORMICK
Fifty-second.

Episode 609


"FREE HAT"


Written by


Trey Parker





[The Bijou, day, inside. The four boys are seated in the front
row in the nearly empty theater. A couple sits near the back,
just three rows behind.]

STAN
Oh, cool. A preview.

ANNOUNCER
Coming this summer , it's the classic
film that changed America. E.T.: The
Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version
for 2002.  All the E.T. effects have
been digitally upgraded.  All the guns
have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies.
And the word "TERRORIST" has been changed
to "HIPPIE."

STAN
Aw, dude, why would they do that?

CARTMAN
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the
same thing.

KYLE
No, dude. They only changed "terrorist"
to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.


STAN
That's gay.

ANNOUNCER
Coming this summer, it's the motion
picture that changed America. Saving
Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where
the word "NAZI" has been changed to
"PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES,"
and all their guns have been replaced
by walkie-talkies.

STAN
Why the hell do these directors keep
updating their movies?

ANNOUNCER
And now, for your feature presentation:
the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star
Wars: The Empire Strikes Back

THE BOYS
Woohoo!

ANNOUNCER
In the version, the word "WOOKIE" has
been changed to "HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL"
and the entire cast has been digitally
replaced by Ewoks.

THE BOYS
AWWWW!!!

[The Bijou, day, outside. The boys exit the theater]

STAN
Goddamnit, that pissed me off!

CARTMAN
Yeah, we want our money back!

SHLOMO
Sorry, suckers!

CARTMAN
You asshole!

KYLE
Why don't they leave those movies alone?
We liked them the way they were!

TWEEK
Don't you see what this means? All our
favorite movies are going to be changed,
and updated, until we can't even recognize
them anymore.

STAN
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those
asshole directors to keep changing their
movies and making them different! Movies
are art, and art shouldn't be modified!


KYLE
Yeah, what if they had modified the
Roman Coliseum every year? It would
just be another big douchey stadium
now.

STAN
We have to do something. Let's form
a club.

CARTMAN
Yeah! We can form a club that takes
food stamps from poor people and then
sells them back to the government for
a profit.

STAN
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect
films from their directors, so they
can't be messed with!

KYLE
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From
Their Own Directors" club

CARTMAN, STAN
Yeah

TWEEK
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club!
That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm
supposed to take it easy; just, watch
the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if
we form a club there'll be responsibilites.
Commitments!

CARTMAN
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you
to be our new friend to replace Kenny
because we thought you were a team player!


TWEEK
I'm not! I'm not a team player!

CARTMAN
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics
or we'll find someone to replace YOU!


TWEEK
D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!

[South Park, later. The boys stand next to a phone pole and Stan
nails a sign onto it. He finishes and backs up to have a good
look at it.]

CARTMAN
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna
show up!

STAN
Well what's wrong with it?

CARTMAN
Look at it, dude. You're not offereing
any fabulous prizes. You have to offer
fabulous prizes if you want people to
show up for your stupid crap. Here.


KYLE
"Free hat?"

CARTMAN
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe
people will show up.

TWEEK
But we don't have hats!

CARTMAN
Well we can just make them out of paper.


TWEEK
Aahh!

CARTMAN
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little
paper hat. People just need free stuff
- don't you guys know anything?!

TWEEK
You see?? First we were just forming
a club, now we have to make hats! When
does it end??

STAN
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium
ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats.


TWEEK
Fifty hats? Oh Jesus!

[Tweek's house, later. He's at his desk in his room frantically
making paper hats. His mug of coffee sits off to his left]


TWEEK
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make
it!

RICHARD
Tweek!

TWEEK
Hrrr!

RICHARD
Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris
told you. Find your center.

TWEEK
My center. My... center.  Calm  Cup?


CARTMAN
Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!

TWEEK
Gaaaaah!

CARTMAN
How many hats have you made?

TWEEK
Oh God!

CARTMAN
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!
Get the lead out!

TWEEK
Aaaah! Oh God!

[South Park Elementary gymnasium, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman
stand outside the doors waiting for Tweek, who rushes up to them
with a box of hats. A poster behind them seems to have fallen
off the wall]

TWEEK
You guys, we have a big problem!

STAN
What?

TWEEK
I was up, all night, making hats. I
only slept for an hour, ...and then
I dreamt about making hats, but I only
made fifteen!

KYLE
Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.


STAN
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown
up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand
people in there!

TWEEK
A thousand?  Oh Jesus man! I don't have
nearly a thousand hats!

CARTMAN
Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!

TWEEK
Goohoo!

KYLE
Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these
people all turned out because they believe
in saving films. Maybe they don't even
care about the free hats.

CROWD
Free hat!  Free hat! Free hat!

TWEEK
Oh God!

CARTMAN
I told you guys: never underestimate
the power of a free hat.

CROWD
Free hat! Free hat!

TWEEK
I gotta move away, you guys!

STAN
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have
to go in there and explain what happened.
There are more important things right
now than free hats.

[The school gym, inside. The crowd jumps up and cheers as the
four boys enter and climb onstage. Some of the signs they hold
read "FREE HAT," "FREADOM FOR HAT NOW!," and "HAT DIDN'T DO IT"]


STAN
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for
coming. We're really happy to see such
enthusiasm for our cause.

CROWD
Yeah! Yeah!

STAN
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortuantely
we don't have enough of the... free
hats for everyone.

SKEETER
Eh- Excuse me?

CARTMAN
Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek
here didn't make enough of them.

TWEEK
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!


WOMAN
We don't care about that.

TWEEK
You don't?

STAN
You mean, you just came because you
believe in our cause?

SKEETER
Yeah. Free Hat.

TWEEK
What?

MAN
Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison
in '82, and we believe he should be
released!

MAN 2
Yeah!

CROWD
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!

STAN
Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been
a bit of a misunderstanding. This is
a rally to save films from their directors?


MAN
To do what?

KYLE
We believe that films are pieces of
art that must be preserved from the
perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..


SKEETER
Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess
we're in the wrong place.

CROWD
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!

STAN
Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's
happening out there? The films you all
grew up with, that touched YOUR lives
and are part of YOUR soul are now being
updated and changed. Join us and we
CAN be a group that makes a difference!


SKEETER
Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?


STAN
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free
Hat.

SOME PEOPLE
Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!

CROWD
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!

[Stan's house, later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit at the dining
room table, with Stan counting the sign-ups]

STAN
...212, 213, 214 members!

TWEEK
You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've
got terrible news!

KYLE
What?

TWEEK
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline
to talk about our cause.

STAN
Really? That's great.

KYLE
Yah.

TWEEK
No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too
much pressure!

STAN
If we go on Nightline, the whole country
can hear about what's happening to our
classic films.

CARTMAN
But just remember that I do all the
talking.

KYLE
You?? Why?

CARTMAN
Because I'm the official spokesman.
I got dibs on it.

STAN
When did we do dibs for it?

CARTMAN
Just now -  1 2 3 dibs!

KYLE
Me.

TWEEK
Ga-ahah!

KYLE
Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman,
Cartman! But you'd better not screw
it up!

CARTMAN
What could possibly go wrong?

[Nightline. Ted Koppel is at his desk with the four boys in the
inset over his left shoulder]

TED KOPPEL
A new movement is sweeping the country,
led by four determined boys from South
Park, Colorado. The organization was
created to protect Hollywood's classic
films from the hands of their directors.
And also to free Hat McCollough. So
boys, I ask you the question that's
on everyone's minds, why does your organization
want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted,
confessed serial murderer of twenty-three
babies?

CARTMAN
...I believe that can best be answered
by our official spokesman, Tweek.


TWEEK
Gaaarh!

TED KOPPEL
Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed
those toddlers? Why do you want him
free?

TWEEK
Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!

TED KOPPEL
Just answer me this, Tweek: What do
you see as "positive" about toddler
murder?

TWEEK
Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?

TED KOPPEL
Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on
to your other cause, saving films from
their directors. What got you boys interested
in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder
status?

KYLE
We believe that films have to be taken
away from people like Steven Spielberg
and George Lucas because they're insane.


TED KOPPEL
Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because
joining us now are Steven Spielberg
and George Lucas.

TWEEK
Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Hello, Ted.

GEORGE LUCAS
Oh hi, Ted.

TED KOPPEL
Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans
think you're insane and shouldn't be
allowed to alter your films. Your response?


STEVEN SPIELBERG
Well, first of all, both George and
I are very firmly against the murdering
of toddlers.

GEOGRE LUCAS
You're here.

CARTMAN
Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George
Lucas.

TWEEK
Get me out of here! Please, somebody
get me out of heeerre!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
And as for altering our films, all we're
doing is trying to reach a... new audience
with our movies. As the makers of dreams,
we like to speak ...for the children.


KYLE
Ah, I thought we were speaking for the
children.

CARTMAN
Yeah, we're children.

STAN
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and
updated their White Album every few
years, what would we have now?

CARTMAN
Yeah, these guys are only motivated
by money, Ted.

TED KOPPEL
How so?

CARTMAN
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas?
Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?

GEORGE LUCAS
I'm not a Jew!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling
children don't know what you're talking
about. Changing E.T. was the best thing
I ewver did.

KYLE
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd
be like, changing Raiders of the Lost
Ark!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Wait a minute. What'd you say?

GEORGE LUCAS
Eh, that's brilliant!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark!
Why didn't we think of it before?!


KYLE
No. NOO!!

[South Park Elementary School Gym, next day. "SAVE FILMS FROM
THEIR DIRECTORS AND FREE HAT MEETING TODAY." The boys stand before
the new club once again.]

STAN
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've
just learned that George Lucas and Steven
Spielberg now intend to update and change
Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only
one way we can stop this important and
historical piece of art from being harmed.
Mr. Secretary?

CARTMAN
Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us
that the original negative to Raiders
of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere
in George Lucas's house. We need to
find and usurp that negative.

MAN 3
And if we get a hold ot the negative
they can't change the movie?

STAN
That is our understanding.

WOMAN
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't
want them to change Raiders of the Lost
Ark.

CROWD
YEAH!

SKEETER
Yeah! We should go get that negative
as soon as we get Hat free!

CROWD
YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!


KYLE
Nonono! We need to do this first.


WOMAN
But we have to free Hat.

STAN
It's just that, you know, he killed
twenty-three babies.

MAN 4
Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!


CROWD
YEAH!

CARTMAN
He... killed... twenty-three babies
in self-defense?

SKEETER
Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked
by a gang of babies in West Town Park.
When that many babies get together they
can be like piranha.

MAN 5
Three eyewitnesses testified that if
Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd
have killed him!

CROWD
YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!


STAN
Alright alright. But right now we've
gotta focus on getting those original
prints of Raider

SKEETER
He's right. We'd better split up. Some
of you go with the boys and get those
film prints, the rest of us come with
me to go talk to the governor about
freeing Hat.

CROWD
YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Free Hat!

STAN
Well, it looks like we're gonna have
to do this ourselves.

TWEEK
No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal
with the stress you guys create!


KYLE
We're just gonna fly to California and
break into George Lucas's house. What's
stressful about that?

TWEEK
Hwaaah!

CARTMAN
Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something:
You've been our new friend now for two
weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest
with you, it isn't going well.

TWEEK
Haaah!

CARTMAN
People aren't that into you, Tweek.
They find you kind of annoying. Now,
I say you've got one last shot here,
and I don't want you to blow it, okay?
Does that help take the stress off?


[Skywalker Ranch, night. Inside the camera gets a view of Lucas's
library. Among the items there are various props from his Star
Wars films, four Emmys, four Oscars... the door opens and a flashlight
scans the room. Stan, holding the flashlight, walks in with the
other boys]

STAN
Okay, go.

TWEEK
I'm breaking into George Lucas's house.
I'm not breaking into George Lucas's
house. I'm in a green field.

CARTMAN
Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for
faggocity!

KYLE
This looks like the right room.

TWEEK
I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.


STAN
Over here!

KYLE
That's it!

CARTMAN
Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!

TWEEK
Huh uh.

CARTMAN
Get it, you piece of crap, before I
grab your nutsack and twist it!

TWEEK
Guh huh huh!

GEORGE LUCAS
What are you doing?!

TWEEK
Oh God! Oh Jesus!

GEORGE LUCAS
You're the boys from that ...stupid
club. Give me that!

TWEEK
Aaaaaah!

KYLE
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!
But please, don't change Raiders of
the Lost Ark.

GEORGE LUCAS
We're gonna make it better. The movie's
gonna be changed, and that's that!


CARTMAN
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid
you leave us no choice. It's time for
Plan B.

STAN
Aw, really?

TWEEK
Oh God, no! Not Plan B!

CARTMAN
You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas,
and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy
heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen?


GEORGE LUCAS
...What??

CARTMAN
Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle
with the coconut tree, there's a lots
of-

STAN
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were
gonna cool his hot heart with a cool
island song.

CARTMAN
...No, he has an icy heart.

KYLE
...But you can't melt ice with a cool
song, 'tardheart.

STAN
So we have to warm his icy heart with
a "hot" island song

CARTMAN
It's a cool island song.

KYLE
Well then we're gonna end up freezing
his hellish heart with a cool island
song.

CARTMAN
Oh, do we wanna do that?

GEORGE LUCAS
ALRIGHT, that does it!

[Skywalker Ranch, day, Lucas's living room. The boys stand behind
Lucas as he talks on the phone with someone]

GEORGE LUCAS
Yes, thank you, officer.  The police
are on their way, boys.  Soon you'll
be in jail getting RAMMED!

TWEEK
Aaaahh!

STAN
Those rams can do to us what they will,
Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying
to protect films.

KYLE
It's not too late to do what's right.
Give us the print. There's still some
good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there
is.

GEORGE LUCAS
It is... too late for me, boys.

KYLE
You yourself led the campaign against
the colorization of films. You understand
why films shouldn't be changed.

GEORGE LUCAS
M-that's different. These are my movies.
I made them, and I have the right to
do whatever I want with them

STAN
You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not
your movies. They're ours. All of ours.
We paid to go see them, and they're
just as much a part of our lives as
they are of yours.

KYLE
When an artist creates, whatever they
create belongs to society

GEORGE LUCAS
Have I... become so old that I've forgetten
what being an artist is about?

STAN
Give the print to us so that we can
protect it from Spielberg and anyone
else who wants to alter it.

GEORGE LUCAS
Perhaps... you are right.

A VOICE
STOP!  What are you doing, George?!


GEORGE LUCAS
Steven, Uh, I-

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Give me that print, George! We need
to make the alterations!

GEORGE LUCAS
Steven, these boys had a point. I don't
remember what it was, but it was good.


STEVEN SPIELBERG
You haven't let these doe-eyed children
affect your judgment, have you, George?!
Don't forget: you belong to me.

KYLE
Don't listen to him! You still have
a chance to preserve your film!

GEORGE LUCAS
I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys.

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Now take the children prisoner!

KYLE
What??

STEVEN SPIELBERG
You troublemakers shall be my guests
of honor at the premiere of the NEW
Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little
club is over!

STAN
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on,
you guys!

TWEEK
Oh my God they're gonna kill us.


GUARD 1
Don't even think about it, kid! I'm
not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!


GUARD 2
The one with the cocaine-problem escaped,
mein Direktor.

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Leave him!! Let him run back to his
mommy!  We must get the film ready for
the premiere.  Lucas! Come!

[A commercial]

ANNOUNCER
Coming, this summer!  It's the digitally-enhanced
re-release of the very first pilot episode
of South Park!  Yes, the classic, rough,
hand-made first episode is getting a
make-over for 2002!  The simple, funny
aliens are now super-badass and kewl!
Flying saucer? No longer cheap construction
paper, but a 4.0 megapixel constructed
through a masterpiece of technology!
Everything's new! New is better!

TREY PARKER
When we first made South Park, we didn't
wanna use construction paper. We just
had to because it was cheap.

MATT STONE
And now with new technology we can finally
remaster South Park, make it look sharp,
clean and focused.

TREY PARKER
Expensive.

ANNOUNCER
Yes, all the charm of a simple little
cartoon  will melt before your eyes
as it is replaced by newer and more
standardized animation!

TREY PARKER
For instance, in the scene at the bus
stop, we always meant to have Imperial
walkers and giant dewback lizards in
the background, but simply couldn't
afford it.

ANNOUNCER
Get this special enhanced version quick,
because another enhanced version will
likely be coming out for 2003!

[School Gym, sometime later. "URGENT" in white has been scrawled
over the sign next to the door. Tweek stands onstage inside,
facing the gathered club]

TWEEK
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have
to do something! Our club president
, treasurer , and secretary  have all
been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg!
Haaa!

MAN 3
Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?

TWEEK
Yes, just like hat!!

SKEETER
But the governor won't pardon Hat. So
how can we get him out of prison?


TWEEK
No! Listen to me! We're not talking
about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look,
we went to George Lucas's house a-and
tried to melt his icy heart with a warm
island song, but then Spielberg showed
up and took three of our members prisoner!
They're goin' to premiere their new
Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have
to rescue them! Do you understand?!


WOMAN
Hey, he's got a point there.

MAN 6
Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's
icy heart with a cool island song!


MEMBERS
Yeah.

TWEEK
No!

SKEETER
No?

MAN 7
No! He's right. We have to freeze his
hot heart with a cool island song.


WOMAN
Or is ti freshen his hot temper with
a cool island song?

MAN 8
Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh
island song.

MAN 9
That's it!

MAN 10
Let's go! Come on!

TWEEK
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself.
Oh God!

[Excess Hollywood. Raiders of the Lost Ark is featured.]

PAT O'BRIEN
Well, the print is finished and the
day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg
and George Lucas  will be at the premiere
of the new special edition of Raiders
of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests
and other rich people will be on hand
to witness all the updated effects and
modernized technology.

[A desert. Spielberg leads a group of people to the site of the
premiere. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are among the guests, but their
hands are tied behind their backs. Four people follow carrying
a large box from two long poles. The box reads "FINAL PRINT RAIDERS
OF THE LOST ARK 2002" The three guards are there with Spielberg
and Lucas, and Francis Ford Coppola has joined the lead pack.
The camera follows the group, but slowly pulls back until Tweek
appears with a bazooka on his shoulder]

TWEEK
Hello!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
The kid? The tweaked out kid?!

TWEEK
I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg!


STEVEN SPIELBERG
Your pesistence surprises even me.


FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA
Surely you don't think you can escape
from this premiere.

TWEEK
That depends on how reasonable we're
all willing to be. All I want are my
friends.

CARTMAN
Wow.

TWEEK
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.


CARTMAN
AY!

FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA
And if we refuse?

TWEEK
Then your premiere has no movie!

STAN
He's definitely lost it

KYLE
Yup.

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand
ba- stand back! Back!  Okay kid, you
win.  Blow it up.  Zuroch! Zuroch!
Blow it back to God.  All your life
has been the pursuit of seeing a great
film! This new version of Raiders has
digital effects beyond your wildest
dreams! You want to see it screened
just as much as I.

KYLE
Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Son, we are simply passing through
history. This... is imPROVED history.
Do as you will.

[The governor's office, day. The governor is at his desk, bored.
The Free Hat club members break out in song]

MEMBERS
In the tropical isle with the coconut
tree, the air is fresh and the people
are free.

MAN 5
But here in the mountain there's no
freedom like that.

SKEETER
There's a man in prison and his name
is Hat.

[A sign saying "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK Premiere Tonight" has
alternating blinking lights. The camera moves off the sign and
onto the makeshift open-air theater. Two men bring forth the
Ark of the Covenant, which was in the box. The men move off.
The audience is seen, with the four boys in the very back. Stan
and Kyle are tied to one post, Tweek and Cartman to the other.
Spielberg, dressed as a High Priest, approaches the Ark]

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone.
This is the birth of the NEW version
of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall
screen it here, and then destroy all
the old prints in celebration!

AUDIENCE
Hooray! All right!

STEVEN SPIELBERG
Begin the film!

AUDIENCE
Whoa.

STAN
You guys, close your eyes. Don't look
at it.

TWEEK
Ah, what?!

STAN
Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll
be terrible. Close your eyes!

AUDIENCE
Whoa. Ahhh.

STEVEN SPIELBERG
It's beyooootiful.

VIEWER 1
Wait a minute. This version is awful!


VIEWER 2
Yeah! They ruined it!

VIEWER 3
Oh my God, it's terrible!

GEORGE LUCAS
AaaaAAAAA!!

[the three men huddle, frightened as they are. On screen, Indy
is reaching for a golden item. Rays of light alight from the
screen and move out over the audience, shooting through the viewers'
chests and killing them. Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg are overwhelmed
with the energy from the rays. The men become disfigured, then
their faces melt away. Spielberg's head explodes. The rays diffuse,
then gather back into the Ark. The spirits of all killed are
gathered into the Ark as well. The lid lands on the Ark perfectly
with a final roll of thunder. A few second laters, when all is
quiet, Stan raises his head and looks around]

STAN
Yuh, you guys okay.

KYLE
Yeah. I I think so.

CARTMAN
Man, that new version must have sucked
balls.

[South Park, day. A celebration is taking place at South Park
Square. An orchestra performs below the stage. The boys are onstage
watching it all. A man, a mayor's aide, walks up to the mic]


AIDE
Today is a day of celebration, and we
owe it all to these four brave young
boys.

TOWNSMAN
Yeah! Alright!

AIDE
And thanks to the bravery of this young
man in particular,  ...Hat McCollough
is finally free from prison!

TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! Woohoohoo!

KYLE
...What?

TOWNSFOLK
Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
Hat! Hat!

HAT MCCOLLOUGH
Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!!
Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE
THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder
if i could get a baby real quick?


SKEETER
Sure. Give that man a baby!

TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! Woohoohoo!

STAN
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of
here.

TWEEK
Oh my God!

[South Park, day. The boys walk away from the celebration and
down the street.]

KYLE
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?
I mean, no one even seemed to notice.


STAN
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do
don't matter right now. Sometimes they
matter... later. We have to care more
about later sometimes, you know? I think
that's what separates us from the Steven
Spielbergs and George Lucases of the
world.

CARTMAN
That and youth. Those guys are old.


TWEEK
But what about the original prints of
Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody
else takes them and tries to change
them?

STAN
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe.
Somewhere where... nobody will ever
find it.

[A secret warehouse. Someone packs all the original prints of
Raiders of the Lost Ark into a large box. He nails the box shut
and adds a lock. He puts the box on a dolly and carts it off
down a long corridor. On each side are other boxes and crates
of stuff put there so as not to cause any more harm to anyone.
Among the stuff in the warehouse - RED CROSS 9/11 Relief Funds.
Dramatic music plays the episode out. ]

"CASA BONITA"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Stan's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman watch TV from the
couch. Cartman is eating a bowl of chips]

STAN
Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.

CARTMAN
Maybe he caught a disease and died.
That'd be so awesome.

STAN
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't
joke about that.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

CARTMAN
Who's joking?

KYLE
You guys! You guys! I have awesome
news!

CARTMAN
You have AIDS?

KYLE
No. This Saturday, for my birthday,
my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa
Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite
three friends!.

CARTMAN
Wow! Casa Bonita?!

KENNY
(Woohoo!)

STAN
What's Casa Bonita?

CARTMAN
Dude, haven't you ever been there?!
It's a big Mexican restaurant where
they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black
Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!


KYLE
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican
restaurants.

CARTMAN
This Saturday! Awesone!  Casa Bonita!
Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive
atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!

KYLE
Who said I'm inviting you?

CARTMAN
You... your Mom said you could take
three friends.

KYLE
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.


CARTMAN
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who
the hell else are you gonna take besides
Stan and Kenny?

KYLE
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me
to his birthday party last month, so
I owe him one.

CARTMAN
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butthole?!
Why?!

KYLE
Because Butters isn't a total dick to
me!

CARTMAN
I have never been a dick to you.

KYLE
Oh please! All you ever do is call
me names and rip on me for being Jewish!


CARTMAN
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you
for being a Jew?

KYLE


[in the playground. Craig is there instead of Kenny] Oh yeah?!
Well you're a stupid Jew!

[in the playground, by the school's back doors] You're a Jew!


[in Cartman's room. Cartman is wearing a crown] Shut your God-damned
Jew mouth!

[at Kyle's house, on the front steps] Good job, Jew!

[singing the Dreidl song with Kyle's family and Stan] Jew...


[leaving his seat in class] Shutup Jew!

[at Cartman's house, with outfits] You're Jewish!!

[seated on a curb with the other boys] Dude, he's Jewish!

[staking out a house] Jew!

[on Nightline, seated next to Stan] Jew!

[in Cartman's dining room] Jew!

[at the side of a road, with Tweek and with their parents] Jew!


[next to stacks of lumber, as Kyle is about to whack him] Jew!


[at a barn, through a hole on the roof] Jew!

[Stan's room. Kyle reads a Bible] Jew?!

[At the Costa Rican rainforest, during practice] "I told you
Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman"

CARTMAN
Okay, except maybe for that one time.


KYLE
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman,
and I'm not inviting you.

CARTMAN
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita
is my most favorite place  in the whole
world. I'll just, I'll just die if you
don't take me! Please!

KYLE
Sorry, my mind's made up.

CARTMAN
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna
go to your faggy birthday party anyway!
I'd much rather hang out at home than
have to be around you and your Jew mom
for a day!  Kiss my ball, asshole!!
Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.
Ah I really really wanna go to Casa
Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight
just now. You know, I mean, I said some
things, you said some things, but, I
think it was good and we we've moved
past it.

KYLE
I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.


CARTMAN
Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die!
I hope you fucking die!

[Cartman's house, night. Cartman sleeps...]

CARTMAN
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh,
awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black
Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More
sopapillas, please!

KYLE
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't
go.

CARTMAN
No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!
Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited
to go! I'm just gonna have to start
being nice to Kyle!

[Kyle's house, next day. Cartman approaches the front door in
a nice sweater and rings the bell. Kyle answers]

CARTMAN
Hi Kyle.

KYLE
That isn't it, Cartman.

CARTMAN
What isn't it?

KYLE
That's not being nice! That's just putting
on a nice sweater!

CARTMAN
...I don't understand the difference.


KYLE
I know you don't.

CARTMAN
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh
I need your help on something.

JIMMY
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-waht seems to
be the p-p-p-prrroblem?

CARTMAN
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and
you seem to be really good with people,
so, I was wondering if you could tell
me, how "do" you act nice to people?


JIMMY
Well, the best thing is not to act nice,
Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely
nice.

CARTMAN
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice
to people?

JIMMY
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is
just making people smile and laugh.
The best way to do that is by telling
a fan-tastic joke or a humorius anti-d-
ant'duhh ...antecdote.

CARTMAN
Like what?

JIMMY
Well, like, try this one on for size:
Knock knock.

CARTMAN
Who's there?

JIMMY
Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, "Ingmar
Bergman who?"

CARTMAN
Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't
you ever talk bad about Kyle again!
Kyle is my friend! And if you say you
had sex with his mom one more time,
I'm gonna really let you have it! You
hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.

KYLE
Do you really think that beating up
a handicapped kid is being nice?


CARTMAN
Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock
knock, Kyle!

[The school cafeteria. Cartman is looking at a picture. A tear
wells up in his left eye. The picture's frame reads "I Had A
Good Time at CASA BONITA," and the picture within is one of Cartman,
his mom, and the mariachis in the background. He hears Kyle's
excited voice.]

KYLE
Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!


BUTTERS
Wow, that's gonna be so fun!

STAN
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four
of us.

KENNY
(Yeah!)

[The school hall, the bell rings. Red and Jordan walk one way,
Kyle and Craig the opposite way. Keven opens up his locker. Kyle
stops at his locker, and Cartman walks up]

CARTMAN
Hey Kyle.

KYLE
Well?

CARTMAN
Well what?

KYLE
How are you going to try to get invited
to Casa Bonita this time?

CARTMAN
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told
Butters he could go.

KYLE
Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.

CARTMAN
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never
meant to make you feel like you didn't
matter at all to me. I know we argue
all the time and I give you tons of
crap, but we've also been through a,
a lot together, and... maybe that alone
doesn't make us friends, but it makes
us something. So, ...whatever, you know,
just... ah I hope... things will be
cool.

KYLE
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.


CARTMAN
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.

KYLE
Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't
care that you can't go?

CARTMAN
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't
mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't
hang out anymore.

KYLE
That's exactly what I wanted to hear
from you all along. Ah uh I still have
to take Butters, but... I hope things
can be cool too.

CARTMAN
Good.

KYLE
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters
can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take
his place.

CARTMAN
Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!

[Cartman's house, Friday night. Cartman leads Butters into his
bedroom]

BUTTERS
What's this all about, Eric?

CARTMAN
Butters, can you keep a secret?

BUTTERS
Well, sure I can!

CARTMAN
For the past five days I've been looking
out into space for a school project.
This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught
first sight of something terrible.


BUTTERS
Nnn-how terrible?

CARTMAN
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming,
heading right for earth.

BUTTERS
What??

CARTMAN
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray
that I'm wrong, but, I just want you
to take a look and... see what you think.
Do you see anything?

BUTTERS
I just see stars.

CARTMAN
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your
eyes a minute to adjust.

BUTTERS
Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait.
Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's
a meteor! Oh my God!

CARTMAN
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting
closer?

BUTTERS
It is! It is getting clsoer! Oh my God!


CARTMAN
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of
Wyoming and it's on a collision course
for Earth.

BUTTERS
When do you think uh it'll get here?


CARTMAN
I, I don't know, I, have to do some
calculations.  10 to the power of 1
base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3.
Oh Jesus.

BUTTERS
What??

CARTMAN
According to my calculations, that meteor
is going to hit Earth in less than four
hours.

BUTTERS
Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!

CARTMAN
No! No, Butters, we are going to live!
Do you hear me?! We are going to live!
We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!


BUTTERS
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??


CARTMAN
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter
in his back yard! Come on, Butters!
Hurry!

BUTTERS
AAAAHH!

[Jimbo's house. Cartman and Butters head for the bomb shelter]


BUTTERS
Oh Jeez!

CARTMAN
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down
here!

BUTTERS
Oh God! Oh Jesus!

CARTMAN
All right, we should be safe in here.
This dried food and water should last
us for weeks.

BUTTERS
But what about everyone else? I have
to tell my parents so they can come
here, too.

CARTMAN
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it.
I'll go up and get the others.

BUTTERS
Are you sure?

CARTMAN
I'm not sure of anythng anymore.  Now
Butters, listen: No matter what happens,
no matter what you hear, do not come
out! If I don't make it back in time
with the others, then it will be up
to you to repopulate the Earth.

BUTTERS
But I'm the only one down here. What
am I supposed to repopulate with?


CARTMAN
Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just
stay down here until you hear word from
me. And... pray, Butters... pray for
all mankind.

BUTTERS
Oh God, oh God!

[Kyle's house, Saturday night. Stan and Kenny are dressed in
stripes, Sheila waits in a fur coat, Kyle is in his Sunday best
checkig his watch]

KYLE
Where is Butters? We were supposed to
leave here forty minutes ago.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well I think we better just go without
him, Kyle. It's getting late.

KYLE
Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally!


CARTMAN
Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted
to stop by and give you your present.


KYLE
Oh. Thanks, dude.

CARTMAN
Hope you have a good one. See you later.


KYLE
Oh wait. Cartman.

CARTMAN
Yes?

KYLE
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go
to Casa Bonita with us?

CARTMAN
Butters didn't show? I I can't believe
it. Uh are you sure you told him the
right time and everything?

KYLE
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going.
You in?

CARTMAN
Well I... really would need to go home
first and get my... Weh no no, I guess
I have everything I need. Oh, okay,
sure.

KYLE
All right, let's go.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Okay, boys. Get in the car.

CARTMAN
Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita!
Casa Bonita!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, hello Chris, Linda.

CHRIS
Hello everyone. Have any of you seen
our son?

KYLE
Butters was supposed to go with us to
Casa Bonita tonight.

CHRIS
We know, but... he hasn't been home
since last night. The police have been
looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank
you. Uh, please, let us know if you
find out anything.

LINDA
Oh Butters!

KYLE
Aw dude, weak.

CARTMAN
Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.
Well, let's get going, shall we?


KYLE
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a
birthday party while Butters is missing.


STAN
Yeah, it's kinda weird.

CARTMAN
Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right,
but, on the other hand, I think Butters
would want us to go. You know Butters...


KYLE
Nah, I can't. We should help look for
him.

STAN
Yeah.

KYLE'S MOTHER
That's very good of you, boys. We can
postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.


CARTMAN
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to
keep Butters in the...  In the... depths
of my heart for that long. I sure hope
he... turns up before then.

STAN
Dude, we should check over at Stark's
Pond. Butters always hangs out over
there.

KYLE
Yeah. And then we can try the football
field.

KYLE'S MOTHER
I'll drive you boys.

CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep
Butters down in that bomb shelter for
a whole week?!

[South Park, Sunday. In front of the police station, Officer
Barbrady stands by while one of his men issues the report to
the crowd standing before the dais.]

CAPTAIN
All right, folks, this is the little
boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch,
also known as Butters. He's been missing
for two days and was last seen at the
school. Let's go find him.

[The bomb shelter. Butters has found the light switch and is
enjoying the rations stored on the shelves along the wall]


BUTTERS
"Dried food rations. Add water to feed
flavored square..."  Hello?  Hello??


CARTMAN
Butters!

BUTTERS
Hwaaaah!!

CARTMAN
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!


BUTTERS
Wuh, wait, well, what happened??

CARTMAN
The meteor... struck the Earth sooner
than I predicted. There was no time...
no time...

BUTTERS
What about my parents. Did you see them?


CARTMAN
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic!
People were crawling all over each other
in the streets! It was... awful! When
it hit, millions were evaporated instantly.
The rest of us... walking around in
a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.


BUTTERS
Oh my God, let me see!

CARTMAN
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll
get infected too! You best wait for
the radiatino level to go down. Probably...
next week sometime. After Saturday.
Ugh...

BUTTERS
How many survivors are there? You should
all come down here.

CARTMAN
We can't come down there, or else, we'll
contaminate you, Butters. No... we just
have to survive the best we can.


BUTTERS
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough
for everything you've done for me.


CARTMAN
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And...
rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember,
wait one week for the toxic levels to
go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All
right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.


[Police station, night. News 4 is covering another announcement
by the police]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it has now been three days since
the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople
continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.


CAPTAIN
All right, folks. I wanna thank you
for all your efforts. Three days is
a long time, but we've got to keep going
if we're gonna find him.

CARTMAN
Heh you're not going to find him. Not
until after Saturday when I go to Casa
Bonita.

CAPTAIN
Many times in cases like these a child
can trap themselves. It is important
that we spread our search to duct pipes,
wells, and bomb shelters.

CARTMAN
What what what?

CAPTAIN
I say we need to move the search to
ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's
move out, people! Every second counts!


CARTMAN
UUuuugh!!

BUTTERS
But if you leave me now, you'll take
away the biggest part of me.

Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,

Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl-

[the shelter lid opens again] Eric? [rises and looks up the shaft]
Eric, is that you?

CARTMAN
Oh God! They're coming! They're coming!
We'be gotta get out of here! They're
coming this way!

BUTTERS
Who's coming this way?

CARTMAN
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor
destroyed all of society, Butters. Now
Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans
gone mad! Those of us who survived are
now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!


BUTTERS
Oh God! I hate cannibals!

CARTMAN
They're coming this way! I can hear
them coming. They'll find you down here
for sure. And when they do, they'll
eat you alive.

BUTTERS
Noooo!

CARTMAN
We've gotta get you out of here! Come
on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic
radiation! Hey wait! We can use this
box!  There we go. This should keep
you protected from the toxins.

BUTTERS
But I can't see nothin'.

CARTMAN
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna
see what's up there. Now come on. I'll
guide you to a safer location.  There
you go. Two more steps and you're at
the top.  Good.

BUTTERS
Are we out in the destruction?

CARTMAN
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering
bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings,
and what used to be our town.

BUTTERS
Aw man.

CARTMAN
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow
the sound of my voice.

[An open field, night. Butters and Cartman are walking through
the field behind a row of houses, far enough away so that no
sound can reach them]

CARTMAN
Right now we're walking by what used
to be people's houses, now just smoldering
burnt piles of rubble.

BUTTERS
Huh... Oh, it's terrible.

CARTMAN
We're coming now to the crater where
the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth
over two miles in diameter.

BUTTERS
Whoa!

[The old gas station]

CARTMAN
Here we are at the old gas station.
It survived a lot of the impact. We
might be safe here.  Oh my God!

BUTTERS
Whaaat??

CARTMAN
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!


BUTTERS
AAAAHH!

CARTMAN
We've got to fight them off!  Stay away
from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!
Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!


BUTTERS
Waaaaaah!

CARTMAN
Aw man, he's eating my hand like a
piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones
crack?

BUTTERS
Ooohhhh!

CARTMAN
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body
with an axe in the back. I'll pull out
the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's
head. Hunh!  Die!

BUTTERS
Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!


CARTMAN
The cannibal! The cannibal's dead,
Butters! But he bit me,  which means
soon I will have a taste for human flesh
as well.

BUTTERS
Oh no!

CARTMAN
We have no choice, Butters! We have
to lock you away somewhere where even
I can't get to you!

BUTTERS
Uh w-where??

CARTMAN
Look! There's an old refrigerator!
Get inside, Butters! I'll break off
the handle so nobody can get to you!


BUTTERS
Aren't you coming?

CARTMAN
Too late for me. I can already feel
my... body start to... change.  No!
Must... fight... it... Don't open this
door for anybody, Butters! No matter
what you hear, stay inside for four
days! Here's some water and food from
the shelter.

BUTTERS
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the
whole world. I... I love you.

CARTMAN
I love you too, man. I just  You look
so delicious! Must eat your brains!


[South Park, next day. Cartman is happily asleep in his bed and
his alarm goes off.]

CARTMAN
Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!
Only three more days till Casa Bonita.
I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave
first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff
divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's
my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive
in the pool!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!


[Park County Trash Dump, night. The refrigerator is now there
and begins to heave. Butters kicks his way out of it, having
run out of air]

BUTTERS
Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God.
Oh my God, the meteor took out everything!
It's all destroyed. Nothingn left.
Hello? Are there any, are there any
other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must
have been where the library was. And
that was probably the school. Hello?
Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for
readioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal?
Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little
dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks
like you and me are the only ones who
survive the meteor, heh. We should stick
together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on,
we gotta start cleanin' up this mess,
and rebuild this civilization. Boy,
that meteor sure did make everything
stinky.

[South Park, day. On the highway, Sheila drives the boys towards
their destination. All the boys are now wearing suits instead
of sweaters. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sit in the back seat]


CARTMAN
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're
gonna be there very soon. You're gonna
love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's
this one part where you can dress up
in Old Western clothes and get your
photo taken in a fake jail.

STAN
Really?

KYLE
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

CARTMAN
"Pretty cool." So, um, should we go
to Black Bart's Cave first or watch
the puppet show? I think we should go
through Black Bart's Cave right away
'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven
or eight times. And then we'll watch
the cliff divers before the puppet show.


STAN
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should
do whatever he wants to do.

CARTMAN
What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding,
birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever
Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.


CARTMAN
Happy Birthday to you. Happy-

STAN, CARTMAN, KENNY
Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear
Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. .

[Park County Trash Dump, day. A worker drives into the dump in
her truck and pulls out stuffed trash bags from the truck bed.]


BUTTERS
You take away the biggest part of me.
Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please
don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just
had to find my say to you tan...

WORKER
Hello?

BUTTERS
HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?


WORKER
With what?

BUTTERS
You're not a cannibal, are you?

WORKER
No

BUTTERS
Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like
me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor.
And it's a lady, too. That means we
can repopulate the earth. Yippee!


WORKER
Kid, what are you doin' here?

BUTTERS
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a
look.  This is the library, and over
here is the bank. That over there I'm
thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's.
And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman,
the person who gave his life so that
I could rebuild society. Well ma'am,
I guess we should start repopulatin'
the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever
you are.

WORKER
Kid, I don't know what you think is
going on, but this place is a dump.


BUTTERS
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my
first society! I'm doin' my best!


WORKER
No, I mean you're at the garbage dump.
The town is right over there, everybody
is fine, and I think they've been looking
for you for over a week.

BUTTERS
Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?


[Casa Bonita, night. Sheila pulls into a parking space]

CARTMAN
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!
Aw man, this is gonna be so great!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.
Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.
Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys,
they found Butters.  He's okay.

KYLE
Oh, awesome.

STAN
I knew he'd turn up.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?
Oh really?

KYLE
What?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, I will certainly let him know.
Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric
here is responsible for Butters missing,
because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita.


KYLE
What?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Eric, the South Park Police are already
on their way here to have a little talk
with you!

CARTMAN
But... Casa Bonita.

KYLE
I should have known better! You never
cared about my birthday at all!

CARTMAN
But I...  but...  Stand back!

STAN
Cartman, stop it!

CARTMAN
I... am going... to Casa... Bonita!


KYLE
It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here
in less than a minute.

CARTMAN
\ Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute!
Less than a minute!


Cartman!

[Casa Bonita, inside. Cartman races into the restaurant]

CARTMAN
Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me?
Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank
you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get
to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me?
Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's
Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!
Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh,
that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!
Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!
Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.
Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas
please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet
show! Puppet show!

KYLE
Cartman!

CAPTAIN
All right, kid! End of the line!

CARTMAN
Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!

KYLE
Jesus Christ!

CAPTAIN
Well kid, you made an entire town panic,
you lost all your friends, and now you're
going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh,
was it wirth it?

CARTMAN
Totally.

"FUN WITH VEAL"


Written by


Trey Parker





[A ranch, day. A rancher stands next to his cow corral as the
South Park Elementary bus drives up. The bus stops and Ms. Choksondiksteps
off]

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Okay children, step off the bus and
form a group next to the nice redneck
- I mean, rancher.

RANCHER
Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher
Bob.

MS. CHOKSONDIK
Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.


KIDS
Hi, Rancher Bob.

RANCHER BOB
I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful
world of beef. Follow me.

KYLE
City kids get to go to museums for
field trips. We get cow farms.

RANCHER BOB
Now, out here you can see our cattle.
This is where the magic begins as the
cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain
death.

CARTMAN
They look so delicious.

RANCHER BOB
Now here we have the slaughterhouse.
This is where we turn the cows into
steaks and burgers.

KIDS
Eewwww!!

KYLE
Aw, dude.

RANCHER BOB
Hey, anybody want a free sample?

CARTMAN
Memememee!

RANCHER BOB
And in here, boys and girls, we have
our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal
the whole key is keepin' the cows chained
so they can't walk around or get any
exercise. That way, their muscle tissue
stays soft, and makes for tender veal.


STAN
Wiat a minute. Veal is... little baby
cows??

RANCHER BOB
Yeppir.

KYLE
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??


RANCHER BOB
Well, if we called it "little baby cow"
people might not eat it.

STAN
Yeah, I wouldn't have.

BUTTERS
Huh, me neither.

CARTMAN
Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks
delicious

KYLE
What??

CARTMAN
Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have
a free sample of these, too?

RANCHER BOB
Well, no, but all these veals are goin'
to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'.
They'll be steaks by tommorow afternoon
and then you can buy them at your grocery
store.

CARTMAN
Alriiight!

STAN
Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help
them.

KYLE
Yeah.

[Cartman's house, night. A light is on in the living room. Catman
is asleep in his bed. Butters, Stan and Kyle climb up to his
window.]

STAN
Pst, Cartman.

CARTMAN
No, Uncle Jesse, no!

STAN
Cartman, wake up!

CARTMAN
What? What the hell are you guys doing??


KYLE
Come on, we've gotta go!

CARTMAN
Where are we going?

STAN
We're gonna go to save the little baby
cows, fatass!

CARTMAN
What? Why?

KYLE
'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered
tomorrow, butthole!

CARTMAN
So?

STAN
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag!
You're our friend; now come help us!


CARTMAN
Well, lessee, in the last three point
two seconds you've called me "fatass,"
"butthole," and "douchebag." I really
don't feel like you guys's friend.


STAN
We're sorry, you are our friend. We
need you to help us because friends
stick together.

BUTTERS
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we
needed him because he has the "Mission
Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."


STAN
Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!


CARTMAN
Oho! So you me and my Mission Impossible
Breaking and Entering playset!

STAN
Yes we do. We're those little baby
cows' only hope. Will you help us?


CARTMAN
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my
black ass.

KYLE
What?!

CARTMAN
Just give it a little kiss and I'll
help.

KYLE
Screw you, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Hokay, but if you want my help you have
to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss
it.

STAN
Go on, dude it's the only way.

KYLE
No!

CARTMAN
Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.

STAN
Just do it really fast, and we can go.


KYLE
Have Butters kiss it.

CARTMAN
No, it has to be Kyle.

KYLE
Awww!

CARTMAN
Oh man, that was soho awesome!

KYLE
Sick! I felt it on my face!

STAN
Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!


CARTMAN
Hell, I'm not goin' with you!

KYLE
Hyaaaa!

CARTMAN
Heeeey!

[Rancher Bob's ranch, night. The boys are walking on the roof
of the veal ranch. They stop, and Stan opens the playset to put
on the costume and harness]

BUTTERS
Oh I don't know about this, fellas.
It says right here on the Mission Impossible
Breaking and Entering playset: "Not
for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking
and entering is a cr-riime."

STAN
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby
cows should be a crime, too!  How does
this thing work, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Jesus, don't you guys have any toys?
First you put on the black ski mask
and use the torch to cut a hole in
the roof.

[The hold is created, and Stan, now dressed in black and in harness,
is lowered into the ranch. He stops just short of the ground]


STAN
Okay, that's far enough. I'm going
to go delta.

CARTMAN
You have to talk louder. I forgot the
double-A batteries for the SuperTalk
play-action headset.

STAN
I said that's far enough!  Don't be
scared, little baby cow. We're here
to set you loose.  There you go. You're
free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder
you.

CARTMAN
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing
my ass off.

KYLE
You need to freeze some of your ass
off.

CARTMAN
O! At least I have as ass, Jew!

KYLE
What?

STAN
Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You
have to get out of here.

BUTTERS
Huuh what's the matter?

STAN
They aren't leaving.

CARTMAN
See? Maybe they want to become sweet
juicy veal steaks.

KYLE
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk
before. They just don't know how.


STAN
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.
Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here.
We'll just keep them at Butters' house
until they can get their strength back.


BUTTERS
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into
my house. I'll get grounded.

STAN
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not
a team player! We'll bring them to my
house.

KYLE
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three
calves to your house?

STAN
I dno't know.

CARTMAN
I've got it. We could kill Butters,
and then float the calves on a river
of blood.

KYLE
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't
hve that much blood in him!

BUTTERS
Eh yeah I do too!

STAN
We're just gonna have to carry them
one by one.  Come on, you guys.

CARTMAN
Eh!

[The boys are shown walking down an icy road, each carrying a
calf... except... one calf is sliding across the ice, then stops.
Cartman appears to follow it, but he approaches it and stands
next to it]

CARTMAN
Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.


[Stan's house, day. The boys and the calves are in Stan's room.
Three of the boys are there with the calves]

CARTMAN
Man, these calves smell like crap! I
don't see how you're gonna hide them
from your mom much longer.

STAN
We won't have to. Butters said he has
something in his house that makes baby
cows strong again. He's bringing it
over.

KYLE
Butters has that at his house?

BUTTERS
Hey fellas!

STAN
Butters!  Did you bring it?

BUTTERS
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby
cows in shape in no time!

KYLE
All right!

BUTTERS
"Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."


STAN
What?

BUTTERS
"Makes your calves stronger in just
- two days!"

KYLE
Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?

BUTTERS
Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne
promises right on the box that it works.


[Stan's house, front door, moments later. Rancher Bob and Officer
Barbrady are at the front door. Barbrady knocks. Sharon opens
the door and Rancher Bob tips his hat to her]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Mr. Marsh.

SHARON
Officer Barbrady. What can I do for
you?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, we've got a little problem. Gent
here caught your boy and his friends
trespassing on his ranch. They stole
some of his property.

SHARON
Stole? A-a-are you sure?

RANCHER BOB
I followed a calf-curling path right
to your house, ma'am.

SHELLEY
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick
his ass, Mom.

SHARON
Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm
sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding.
Stanley, did you see-?

STAN
Aw crap!

SHARON
Stanley, what are you doing with those
calves?

STAN
That asshole is gonna kill them and
feed them to people!

RANDY
Stanley, they belong to him.

STAN
They don't belong to anybody! Please
Mom, we don't want these calves to die.


SHELLEY
Let me hit him, Mom!

SHARON
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion.
The rancher is gonna take his cows back
and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley!
Stanley, you open this door right now
or you're gonna get it!

STAN
No!

RANDY
Stan, you're behaving like a kid!

STAN
You're the ones who made me eat veal
without telling me what it was! You're
the onew who know we were making little
baby animals suffer!

SHARON
Open this door, now!

STAN
Kiss my ass!

BUTTERS
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.


KYLE
You're getting in pretty deep, dude.


[Stan's house, living room. The adults have gone back downstairs.]


SHARON
I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.


RANCHER BOB
Oh, why, why don't you just tell them
that the cows will be safe. And when
they come out I can take them back.


SHARON
I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed
him like that, I'd pay for it the rest
of my life.

RANCHER BOB
Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's
eight hundred dollars' worth of veal
up there and I have to ship it out Friday.
What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?


OFFICER BARBRADY
Me?? How did I get into this mess?


[Stan's room. Stan paces the floor.]

KYLE
So what happens now?

STAN
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these
cows until we have a guarantee of their
safety, in writing.

KYLE
We're with you, dude.

BUTTERS
Yeah.

STAN
Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna
tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real
ugly. When all is said and done you
could all be looking at being grounded
for three, perhaps even four weeks.
So if any of you guys want out, just
say the word now.

CARTMAN
I want out.

STAN
Shut up, Cartman.

KYLE
We're with you, Stan.

BUTTERS
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little
baby cows down. Why, they've got no
one else to turn to.

STAN
Then it's settled. One for all and all
for one! Except Cartman.

KYLE, BUTTERS
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Yeah! Wait-what?

[Stna's house, living room, night. Kyle's parents have joined
the other adults.]

SHARON
And so that's the situation. Our boys
have locked themselves in Stan's room
until we can promosie them the calves
will live free, in writing.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know
how you raise your kids, but my son
does not play negotiator with me!


SHARON
We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't
that simple!

KYLE'S MOTHER
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle
and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!
This is your mother! You will open
this door right now!

KYLE
...No I won't.

SHARON
Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila.
That was very impressive.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, if you don't do as you're told,
I'm going to be very angry!

KYLE
Well you made me eat veal and didn't
tell me what it was. So go ahead and
be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!


SHARON
Very persuasive.

KYLE'S MOTHER
AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!


CHRIS
Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters?
Butters, this is your father.

BUTTERS
Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?


STAN
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would
come to this.

CHRIS
Butters? Answer me!

BUTTERS
But they-ah they're angry at me.

KYLE
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.
You can tell them...

CHRIS
Butters! Right now!

BUTTERS
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?


CHRIS
WHAT?!

BUTTERS
Oh, sweet Jesus.

CHRIS
What's gotten into them?

SHARON
Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long
enough! Your little game is over!


STAN
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming
out until know the calves will be safe.


SHARON
Well that's fine! You boys can just
stay in there and starve to death. Us
parents are going to go to Pizza Shack
and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.


CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit you guys.

KYLE
Cartman, stay away from that door!


SHARON
You'll have to come out sooner or later,
boys. The longer you wait, the more
trouble you'll be in.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Mmmrragh!!

STAN
Round one is over. We made it.

CARTMAN
We didn't make it! Your mother's right,
douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand
here until we starve?!

STAN
Our parents would never let us starve.
They're bluffing. This is a battle of
wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll
give in.

KYLE
But we will have to sleep, dude.

STAN
Three of us can sleep while one keeps
watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.


BUTTERS
Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam,
huh fellas! Whoopie!

STAN
We'll stay in this room with these baby
cows for as long as it takes!

[Stan's house, living room, after dinner. The women wait at the
sofa while the men try to reason with the boys. Liane is now
present as Sheila crosses her arms and pats her left shoulder
with her right hand. Moments later, the men come down the stairs]


RANDY
Well we tried everything. We can't get
through the door without tearing apart
the house.

KYLE'S FATHER
Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!


LIANE
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must
be getting so hungry. Maybe we should
get them a little food.

SHARON
Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills.
We need our boys to know that we're
not gonna cave in, at all.

LIANE
Oh, all right.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Let's all just go to bed and let them
play their little game for as long as
they can.

[Stan's room, night. From outside, his room is the only one lit.
Inside, Cartman, Kyle and Butters are in his bed while Stan sits
at his desk]

BUTTERS
Good night, fellas!

KYLE
Good night.

BUTTERS
Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway.
Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis.
Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good
night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.


CARTMAN
Butters, I'm going to kill you over
and over again.

[Stan's room, fade to day. Hour 29. The boys are all drowsy and
a little disheveled. Stan sits on his bed stroking a calf, Butters
sits on the floor, Cartman rests against a calf, Kyle holds his
stomach]

CARTMAN
Can't go on. Need... food...

KYLE
We didn't realize hunger made you feel
so bad.

CARTMAN
There's only one alternative, you guys.
We're gonna have to eat a calf.

STAN
No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!


CARTMAN
All right. Then we're gonna have to
eat Butters.

KYLE
He might be right, dude.

BUTTERS
Aw, heck.

STAN
Wait, what is that?  Dude!

CARTMAN
Food!

[Stan's house, outside. Liane lowers her pole as Sharan and Sheila
go outside to see what's going on.]

SHARON
Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?

LIANE
Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby
suffer

SHARON
Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.


[Stan's room, moments later. The boys take shares of food out
of the basket.. Stan walks away with two apples.]

KYLE
All right!

STAN
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!


CARTMAN
Look you guys! Beef jerky!

KYLE
Yeah! And fried chicken!

STAN
Wha?

KYLE, CARTMAN
Mmmmm.

STAN
Dude, what are you guys doing?

KYLE
We're eating, dude.

STAN
You're eating meat! What the hell do
you guys think we're doing all this
for?!

KYLE
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby
cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat
altogether.

BUTTERS
Me neither.

CARTMAN
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all,
you become a pussy.

STAN
That's fine! You guys can live off
of flesh, but I'm never eating meat
again!

CARTMAN
Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want
some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the
buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry
man?

KYLE
Dude, that's messed up.

[Stan's house, night, Hour 34. Police and fire departments and
an ambulance are at the house, with a kleig light shining into
Stan's room from the fire truck. Inside, Stan sits on the floor
still eating his apples, Cartman stands next to the chair, Butters
sits on the bed. The sound of breaking news is heard]

KYLE
You guys, check this out!

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in front of the house
where three insane boy terrorists have
barricaded themselves inside a room
with twenty-three live infant cattle.


BUTTERS
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin'
the same thing we are.  Eugh

FIELD REPORTER
Several attempts to break into the room
have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the
crisis is intensifying. Here's what
some people have to say.

CRAIG'S FATHER, TOM
We were sleeping when suddenly we heard
all the commotion. I mean, to think
this could happen right here in our
own community.

RANDY
We gave those kids everything, and they
turned into little... John Walkers!


FIELD REPORTER
The police chief of South Park says
that there will be no negotiations with
terrorists.

BUTTERS
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now,
fellas.

STAN
No, this is exactly what we wanted.


KYLE
It is?

STAN
Yeah, don't you see? This validates
everything that we're doing. If we're
making the news, then this is obviously
important to people.

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it looks like I have an update:
Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist
story is not interesting news to anyone.
Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom,
so this was the only story we had to
make seem important, but people are
just simply tuning out. So, HBC will
now be switching programming once again
to "Puppoies from Around the World."


[the news break switches to a series of dog scenes. First, dalmatians
run across a field to the tune of bagpipes, then a small dog
looks around to the tune of Chinese music, then a puppy in a
basket as a mariachi band is heard, then another dog is shown,
then another, then a puppy is shown following a tennis ball,
then another dog plays with the camera as more mariachi music
is heard]

STAN
...I don't believe it.

BUTTERS
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite
so far.

[Stan's house, fade to day. Hour 53. Stan and Butters are sleeping,
and Butters, sleeping face down, has his left arm across Stan's
chest. Stan stirs and opens his eyes.]

STAN
Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your
arm around me!

BUTTERS
Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles.


VOICES
We must help the helpless, we must save
the unsaved

KYLE
Huh, what the hell is that?

HIPPIES
If we... fight together we can make
sure the road is paved.

For a... brighter tomorrow...

CARTMAN
Hippies!

STAN
What are they doing here?

HIPPIE
We're with you boys! Your message is
real and your voice is just.

HIPPIES
Hooray! Hooray!

KYLE
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?


BUTTERS
Ew, they're all dirty.

CARTMAN
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some
baby cows from being eaten, and now
we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!


[Stan's house, night, Hour 75. Police and fire departments and
an ambulance have returned. HBC News is there again with its
field reporter]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues
as now members of the FBI arrive to
put an end to the conflict.

SHARON
Oh Jesus Christ.

FBI AGENT
Who's in charge here?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I am. But I don't want to be.

FBI AGENT
Where's the negotiator?

FBI NEGOTIATOR
Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator
Squad

FBI AGENT
All right, see what you can do.

[Stan's room. Stan is petting a calf. Kyle looks on. Stan coughs
and sniffs]

KYLE
Dude, are you okay?

STAN
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't
know what's wrong with me. I've got
these sores.

BUTTERS
What is that?

KYLE
Dude, maybe we should end this.

STAN
No!

[Stan's house, outside. The negotiator walks up to the negotiation
van, which has all the equipment he needs to handle a negotiation]


GLEN DUMONT
Give me a hard line to the phone in
that house!

OFFICER BARBARDY
The terrorists already said there's
no way they're coming out.

GLEN DUMONT
Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's
my job to talk to freaks like this and
bring about a peaceful resolution using
clever psychology.

[Stan's room. The phone rings and Stan goes to answer it]

STAN
Hello?

GLEN DUMONT
Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator.
Is it okay if I talk to you?

STAN
Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named
Mike. What do I do?

KYLE
Don't give him anything!

STAN
Waht do I say??

CARTMAN
Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.


GLEN DUMONT
I'm here to make sure we can all end
this peacefully. You want that, right?


CARTMAN
Sure, sure.

GLEN DUMONT
How about we make a trade, just show
that we can trust each other.

CARTMAN
What do you have in mind?

GLEN DUMONT
Well, how about you send out one of
the calves?

CARTMAN
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here,
Mike.

GLEN DUMONT
Just one, that's all we want.

CARTMAN
All right, how 'bout this? You guys
have all the leverage and we have nothing.
So how about we give you one calf...
-

STAN
Cartman, no!

KYLE
Dude!

CARTMAN
We'll give you one calf, if you give
us... some guns and ammunition of our
own.

GLEN DUMONT
What? I, I can't do that.

CARTMAN
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin'
here, but I guess you're not talkin'
to me. Goodbye.

GLEN DUMONT
No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Yuh, you're right. What reason do you
have to trust me? I'm just a guy from
Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you
know? Just a blue-collar guy like your
dad.

CARTMAN
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna
work.

GLEN DUMONT
Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun,
let me see what I can do.

[Stan's house, night, Hour 154. The authorities are still there,
waiting out the standoff]

GLEN DUMONT
Okay. Up a little... left a little...
Almost there.

RANDY
What is that?

GLEN DUMONT
We're giving the boys some guns in return
for our calves

RANDY
What?

SHARON
You're giving my baby guns?

GLEN DUMONT
Hey, this is a negotiation process,
okay? Did you people go to negotiator
school? No, you didn't!  Get them on
the line for me!

CARTMAN
Hello.

GLEN DUMONT
Alright, you see that? I keep my end
of the bargain.

CARTMAN
All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send
out one calf.

GLEN DUMONT
Well, ha- how about you send out two
calves?

CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no
talking to you, is there, Mike?!


STAN
O-ogh...

CARTMAN
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?!
Don't treat me like I'm stupid here!


GLEN DUMONT
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Damnit, I'm losing
them.  Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out
one calf.

CARTMAN
Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to
get us something else!

GLEN DUMONT
What do you have in mind?

[Stan's house, day. Hour 169. This makes one week and an hour
since the standoff began]

GLEN DUMONT
A little to the left...  Okay, that's
good. A little to the right.

KYLE'S MOTHER
You're giving them a missile??

GLEN DUMONT
Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This
is a delicate process! I've almost earned
their trust!

[Stan's room]

KYLE
Stan's getting worse, you guys.

CARTMAN
Mike, speak.

GLEN DUMONT
How are we doin'?

CARTMAN
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did
you get the other things for us?

GLEN DUMONT
Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to
officially change the word "veal" to
"tortured baby cow."

CARTMAN
Good, good.

GLEN DUMONT
But I couldn't get you North and South
Dakota.

CARTMAN
Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.


GLEN DUMONT
Now, now please can, can we get you
to come out?

[Outside Stan's house, night]

GLEN DUMONT
All right, everythng has worked out.
The boys have promised to come out and
bring the cows out with them.

ADULTS
Yes! All right! Woohoo!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities,
Mr. Negotiator.

FBI AGENT
They're coming out now?

GLEN DUMONT
Yes. All we need to do in return is
get a cattle-transporting semi-truck
that will take the boys and the cattle
to Denver International Airport, where
we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting
to take them all to Mexico.

SHARON
What??

GLEN DUMONT
And they want the guy that plays Mr.
Worf on "Star Trek" to drive the truck.
In full makeup.

RANDY
Jesus Christ!

FBI AGENT
All right, that does it! You are in
fact the worst negotiator I've ever
seen in action!

GLEN DUMONT
All right, all right, I'll give you
that. But in return, I want three staples.


FBI AGENT
Get out of here!  We'll get them the
semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy.
If they see that, thay'll come out and
then, we could take them.

OFFICER BARBRADY
But isn't that dishonest?

FBI AGENT
Maybe so, but if we don't do something
soon, there could be fifty, even sixty
people who'll have to go without veal
for dinner. Are you prepared to let
that happen?

[Outside Stan's house, night. Hour 201, just after sunset. The
semi-truck Cartman ordered arrives.]

FBI AGENT
All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?

MICHAEL DORN
I was woken up at three in the mornng,
told I had to put on makeup, and come
to this town.  What the hell is gong
on?!

FBI AGENT
I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business.
We've got terrorists making demands
and we need your help.

MICHAEL DORN
This is highly unusual!

FBI AGENT
All right boys, we have your truck.
And we have an airplane on the tarmac
at Denver International.

CARTMAN
And Worf?

MICHAEL DORN
My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character
called Worf.

KYLE
Stan! It worked!

STAN
It... did?

KYLE
They got us a truck, and an airplane,
and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be
okay!

STAN
Pick me up. I... I want to see.

[Outside Stan's house, night. The authorities prepare for the
kids' surrender. The front door opens and Cartman looks out.
The FBI agents take aim.]

CARTMAN
Step back! Tell those men to step back!


FBI AGENT
Do it!

FBI AGENTS
Mmrrrr.

HIPPIES
All right! Woohoo! Yeah!

CARTMAN
Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies!
Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine
and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must
refer to me as "Captain."

MICHAEL DORN
Where am I supposed to drive to?

CARTMAN
No. See, must say, "Captain, where am
I supposed to drive to?"

MICHAEL DORN
Captain, where am I supposed to drive
to?

CARTMAN
You're going to back the truck up to
the door of the house so we can safely
load in the calves.

MICHAEL DORN
This whole thing is ridiculous!

CARTMAN
"Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"


MICHAEL DORN
Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous.


CARTMAN
Okay, all set!

[An overhead view of the scene shows a News 4 helicopter covering
the story  from the camera of another News 4 helicopter]

FIELD REPORTER
Tom, it looks as though the terrorists
are now loading the baby cows into the
back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting
news, Tom.

[Ground view, inside the trailer]

BUTTERS
Okay Cartman!

[Ground view, on the street]

CARTMAN
Step on it, Mr. Worf!

BOYS
All right!

[inside the trailer]

BUTTERS
We're going!

KYLE
Mexico here we come!

[in the cab. Police cars follow the semi]

CARTMAN
Wait a minute. They're following us!
Full speed, Mr. Worf!

MICHAEL DORN
We cannot keep going fast on these icy
roads!

CARTMAN
"Captain, we cannot keep going fast
on these icy roads?"

MICHAEL DORN
Captain, we cannot keep going fast on
these icy roads.

CARTMAN
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed
to forty-five and maintain distance
from those police cruisers.

[inside the trailer. Stan casts his eyes down at the floor]


KYLE
Stan, we're almost there. You've got
to hold on.

[On the street. The semi passes by Rancher Bob's ranch]

FBI AGENT
Alright, they're in front of the cattle
ranch. Hit it!

CARTMAN
Oh, it's a double-cross!!

FBI AGENT
Alright, boys! The game is over! Get
out of the truck with your hands up!


[in the trailer]

KYLE
Oh no! No!!

[in the cab]

CARTMAN
What are you waiting for? Go kill them,
Worf!

MICHAEL DORN
I'm NOT killing anybody!

CARTMAN
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!


[Rancher Bob's Cattle Ranch, moments later. The FBI agents take
the calves into the veal ranch as the boys stand next to the
semi. Michael Dorn is there as well.]

STAN
We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!


FBI AGENT
Alright boys, just stay right there
until your parents arrive.

MICHAEL DORN
Can I go now?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your
cattle back for you

RANCHER BOB
Oh.  Well, it doesn't matter now.

OFFICER BARBRADY
What you do mean?

RANCHER BOB
You see, in the six days since the word
"veal" was officially changed to "little
tortured baby cow" the market has gone
dry. Seems that people see "little tortured
baby cow" on their menus, they don't
feel like orderin'.

BUTTERS
Really?

RANCHER BOB
Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now.
I'll let 'em live outside with the other
cows and live a normal life.

KYLE
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've
shut down the veal industry!  Stan?
Stan??

[Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. The boys and their families
are present at Stan's hospital bed. Stan is half-awake now, hooked
up to IVs and all.]

DR. DOCTOR
He's very luck you got him here when
you did. He was in a very advanced state
of vaginitis.

RANDY
Vaginitis?

DR. DOCTOR
It occurs when a person stops eating
meat. Those sores on his skin were actually
small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped
it in time, Stan would have eventually
just become one great big giant pussy.


KYLE
Whoa, dude.

DR. DOCTOR
We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping
into Stan's veins and the... sores are
fading.

CARTMAN
Thank God we stopped it in time.

STAN
Well, I guess we learned somethng today:
it's wrong to eat veal because the animals
are so horribly mistreated, but if you
don't eat meat at all you break out
in vaginas.

BUTTERS
Hear hear.

KYLE'S MOTHER
All right boys, it's time to go home.
You've got some serious grounding time
to start.

CHRIS
I'll say!

BUTTERS
Aw, we're still grounded?

KYLE
But, but we, we learned things, and
took up a cause.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your
parents. And you need to learn that
terrorism is never the answer.

CHRIS
That's right, let's get these terrorists
to their rooms.  But first,  maybe we
can grab some burgers.

THE BOYS
All right!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 409


"DO THE HANDICAPPED GO TO HELL?"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park, the church, day. The congregation is heard singing
along with an organ. Inside, the town has assembled for services]


CONGREGATION
I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus

Over at the park by where he lives

I tell him all my problems [the cantor is shown at the pulpit]


And sometimes he tells me his


What a friend I have in Jesus [Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are shown]


I can say that honestly [other townsfolk are shown]

He's not like all my other friends

Who really don't care about me.

Amen.

STAN
Bo-ring.

CANTOR
And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite
psalm for us, Psalm 46.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, God is our refuge and strength,
m'kay. A very present help in trouble,
m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear,
though the earth be removed, and though
the mountains be carried into the midst
of the sea...

CARTMAN
Hey, you guys, you wanna know what
my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's
obligation to stick his boneration in
a woman's separation.  This sort of
penetration will increase the population
of the younger generation."

COUNSELOR MACKEY
God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She
shall not be moved, m'kay.  Though the
waters thereof roar and be troubled,
m'kay, though the mountains shake with
the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is
a river, the streams whereof shall make
glad the city of God, the holy place-


STAN
Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation
to stick his boneration in a woman's..."


CARTMAN
"It's a man's obligation to stick his
boneration in a woman's separation
to increase the population of the younger
generation."

KENNY
(It's a man's obligation to stick his
boneration in a woman's operation-)


CARTMAN
No no, no. Separation.

STAN
"It's a man's obligation to stick his
boneration in a woman's-"

PRIEST MAXI
BOYS! You are in CHURCH!

CARTMAN
Ugh!

Mr. Mackey. 	-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. [walks
from the pulpit back to his seat. The priest replaces him]


PRIEST MAXI
Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone.
Today, we're going to talk about hell.
Hell is not a very nice place. Burning,
searing, flames. Screaming, torture.
For eternity. Once you are in hell,
you cannot escape. You live forever
in horrible pain, in burning agony.
All sinners are there in misery, dying
over and over and over.  If you be cast
down into this black bog of stench,
then woe is thou,  for Satan has made
it the most miserable place in the universe!
And he will be your ruler!  Your rulet
of pain and agony!

SINGERS
Are we going to the Hukilau?

The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau? [Satan joins them]

The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?

Huki......... Luki......... Lau?......... [the camera pulls back to show everyone.
An Aloha sign appears above.]

SATAN
Yeah!

DEMON
Hennnh!

MAN
Aaawwwwwww!

GARY
Great luau, Satan.

SATAN
Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'.
Oh- Hi, Marsha.

WALTER
Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound
some brews. You wanna join us?

SATAN
Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I
can't. Chris and I just moved to the
west side and we have to unpack.

WALTER
Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!


SATAN
Bye.

[Hell, a marina. Boats, yachts, and one big ship are docked on
the liquid lava below. A complex of buildings is shown. A woman
somewhere screams. At the main entrance the sign reads, "RIVER
STYX CONDOMINIUMS. UNITS STILL AVAILABLE." Inside his condo,
Satan sets up a ceramic doll display and hums a bit]

SATAN
Chris?

CHRIS
Yeah?

SATAN
Did you, uh, see my "Boy With An Umbrella"
Hummel?

CHRIS
Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes
coming from the movers.

SATAN
Oh, okay, thanks.  Oh, that must be
them now.  Just put the boxes by the-


SADDAM
Hello, Satan!

SATAN
Saddam...

SADDAM
Did you miss me, buttercup?

SATAN
No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed
you!

SADDAM
Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I
gonna go? Detroit?

SATAN
Oh no.  Oh, God no.

[South Park, the church, day. Priest Maxi finishes his sermon.
Fear is shown across the faces of many of the congregants]


PRIEST MAXI
A place of everlasting agony and pain!
Hell awaits all sinners and all who
do not accept Christ!  Children in this
town have not been attending Sunday
school after Mass! And adults have not
been coming to Confession! If this does
not change, I promise you, you will
be going to the black pit of Satan's
world!  That is all. Peace be with you.


RANDY
Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.


SHARON
Yeah.

STAN
Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.


SHARON
What?

STAN
We have to go to Sunday school so we
don't burn!

CARTMAN
Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom.

RANDY
Oh, now look at that. They're scared
to death.

PRIEST MAXI
Hell is a very real place, Mr. and
Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their
souls and the souls of everyone in this
town from the wretched lake of fire!


[The wretched lake of fire  I mean, Hell, the River Styx Condominiums,
Satan's front door. Satan has taken refuge behind the door and
peeks out]

SADDAM
Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can
talk.

SATAN
I don't want to talk to you, Saddam!
This isn't what I need in my life right
now.

CHRIS
Is that the movers, Satan?

SATAN
Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers


CHRIS
Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their
check on the counter.

SATAN
Okay, Chris.

SADDAM
Satan, look: I know our relationship
wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I
was too busy tryin' to take over the
world to give you what you needed. But
I've changed, Satan.

SATAN
Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before.


SADDAM
COME ON, can't we just go out for a
burrito?  ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!


SATAN
I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.


SADDAM
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your
ass like I can!

SATAN
Good-bye, Saddam!

SADDAM
Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan,
you can't deny what's between us.  You
can try, but you know we belong together.


SATAN
My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats
me well. You and I are through. Good-bye.


SADDAM
Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break!


NUN
Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And
I'll be teaching you so that you can
all receive your First Communion.


STAN
Are we gonna go to hell?

SISTER ANNE
Well, hopefully not. That's why you're
gonna need to receive Communion.

CARTMAN
A- And as long as we get this Communion
thing, we're safe?

STAN
What if we haven't really done anything
that horribly bad in our lives.

CARTMAN
Yeah, what if we haven't?

SISTER ANNE
It doesn't matter, because we are all
born with Original Sin. Now, let me
explain how Communion works.  The priest
will give you this round cracker,  and
he will say, "The Body of Christ," and
then you eat it.

CARTMAN
Jesus was made of crackers?

SISTER ANNE
No.

STAN
But crackers are his- body.

SISTER ANNE
Yes.

KENNY
(What?!)

SISTER ANNE
In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed
bread and said, "eat this, for it is
my body."

CARTMAN
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we
eat crackers.

SISTER ANNE
Nononono!

BUTTERS
Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?


SISTER ANNE
The Body of Christ!

STAN
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to
eat him, but he didn't want us to be
cannibals, so he turned himself into
crackers, and then told people to eat
him.

SISTER ANNE
No!

STAN
No??

BUTTERS
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many
crackers.

SISTER ANNE
Look: all you have to know is that when
the priest gives you the cracker, you
eat it! Okay?!

KENNY, STAN, CARTMAN
O-kay.

SISTER ANNE
And then, you will drink a very small
amount of wine, for that, is the Blood
of Christ.

CARTMAN
Aw, come on now, this is just getting
silly!

SISTER ANNE
Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!

CARTMAN
Nno!

SISTER ANNE
Then stop questioning me.

CARTMAN
But now we can have Communion and not
go to hell, right?

SISTER ANNE
No. Because before you can take your
first Communion, you have to have your
first Confeesion.

STAN
Confession?

SISTER ANNE
You'll be getting in the Confession
box with a priest and confessing all
your sins, so that God can forgive you.
You kids will all have to go to your
first Confession this Tuesday, so I
want you all to go home tonight and
think long and hard about all your sins,
so that you can tell the priest everything.


KENNY
(OH, SHIT!)

[Hell, the River Styx Condominiums, Satan's kitchen. He and Chris
are washing dishes. He soaks, Chris rinses]

CHRIS
Those were some great pork chops, Satan.


SATAN
Yeah.

CHRIS
Hey, you.  You've been actin' strange
all night. What's up?

SATAN
Nothing. Why?

CHRIS
Well, it's... just that you've washed
that same dish seven times now, silly.


SATAN
Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh.

CHRIS
Come on, Satan. You know you can tell
me anything. What's up?

SATAN
Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today.


CHRIS
Oh.  Woww!  I wasn't ready for that.


SATAN
He showed up spouting all kinds of things
about how he's changed and he still
loves me...

CHRIS
I thought you... killed him.

SATAN
Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?


CHRIS
...Do you still love him?

SATAN
No, Chris.

CHRIS
It's okay of you do.

SATAN
Well, I mean-  Of course, there's a
part of me that will always love him,
I... But I also know how abusive he wasI'm
much happier with you.

CHRIS
Well, you know what I think we should
do? I think we should all get together
and just talk, like adults.

SATAN
What?

CHRIS
We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna
just go meet this guy.

SATAN
No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam
is fucking crazy.

CHRIS
Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy
thing going. But I think that's what
you were attracted to. But I can be
a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops!
Aw, butternuts!

[South Park, curbside. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are seated there.
Cartman has pen and notebook in hand]

STAN
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there
was the time we threw a fish into the
busdriver's hair and she didn't find
it for seven days.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah, okay.

STAN
And thennn there was the time we held
that little first-grader down and farted
on him for 28 munites.

CARTMAN
Right, I already got that one.

KYLE
Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?

STAN
We're trying to remember all our sins.
Sister Anne told us we have to confess
all our sins or else we're gonna go
to hell.

KYLE
Uhwuwhat?

STAN
Have you confessed all your sins yet?


KYLE
No-o-o-o-o!

CARTMAN
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to
confess his sins.

KYLE
Oh good. I don't?

CARTMAN
No, you're already going to hell.

KYLE
I am not!

CARTMAN
You are, too!

STAN
Dude, this ledy told us if you don't
confess all your sins and you don't
eat crackers and drink wine, then you
go to hell. Period.

KYLE
I'm gonna go ask my mom!

STAN
Now, let's see. What about the time
we set Mr. Garrison's cat onfire?


CARTMAN
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.


KENNY
(What?)

BUTTERS
Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought
of somethin'!

STAN
What, Butters?

BUTTERS
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped
kid, uh-Timmy?

TIMMY
Timmiih!

CARTMAN
What'd we do to Timmy?

BUTTERS
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to
hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause
all he can say is his name!

TIMMY
Timmiih!

CARTMAN
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's
pretty screwed.

STAN
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell.
We have to do something.

KENNY
(What are we gonna do?)

STAN
I don't know. I don't know what we're
gonna do.

[Hell. Satan sits on a boulder with four demons and a small monster
off to his left]

SATAN
I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't
deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my
life is so much better now with Chris.
Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect
in every way, but there's just something
about Saddam that I'm more more attracted
to.  In what way?  Yeah, you're right.
Saddam would just treat me bad again.
I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam.
Put him out of my mind and focus on
Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I
won't have such strong feelings for
him. Thanks guys.

CHRIS
There you are.

SATAN
Oh hi, Chris!

CHRIS
I've been lookin' all over for you.
I have to tell you somethin' that might
make you... a little mad.

SATAN
What?

CHRIS
Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited
him over for dinner tonight.

SATAN
You WHAT?!

CHRIS
I just think we all need to get this
out in the open.

SATAN
Oh, Chris! Rraarr!  Rraahh!

CHRIS
Come on, Satan. We're all adults here.
He was an important person in your life,
for better or for worse. So, I wanna
know him. If he sees that I'ma real
person too, then... well, maybe he'll
see how happy we are together.

SATAN
No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is
what he'll do!

CHRIS
Satan, we're not in junior high school
anymore.

SATAN
Oh, dear God.

[South Park, the church. Stan sits on a bench praying. A confession
box stands nearby with two doors, one of which is open. Apparently,
he's already confessed his sins.]

STAN
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is
with thee. Blessed art though amongst
wo-

CARTMAN
How was it?

STAN
Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!

CARTMAN
Huh?

STAN
The guy in there said I have to say
54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember
if I was on number seven or eight.


CARTMAN
Who's in there?

STAN
I don't know. You can't see him; it's
just some anonymous guy.

CARTMAN
Well, here goes everything.

[The confessional, inside. Cartman sits and faces the partition.]


CARTMAN
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.


PRIEST MAXI
Blessed art thou, child. Now, what
do you have to confess?

CARTMAN
Well, let's see. I'd like to start,
if I may, back when I was two and a
half. It was a cold April morning, and
the dew on the grass was frozen, like
tiny beads of glass...

[The church, inside, next to the confessional. Stan continues
his prayers]

STAN
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord
is with thee. Ble-

KENNY
(Hey, dude.)

STAN
God damnit!

KENNY
(What??)

STAN
Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've
got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister
Anne?

SISTER ANNE
Oh, hello, children.

STAN
We have a question.

SISTER ANNE
Okay, shoot.

STAN
Where do handicapped people go when
they die?

SISTER ANNE
The handicapped are just people like
you and me, so the same rules apply.
They need to be baptized, take Communion,
and confess their sins.

STAN
But our friend Timmy can't really talk.
All he can do is say his own name, so
he can't really confess his sins. So
is he goin' to go to hell?

SISTER ANNE
Uugh. This really isn't a question for
me, it's for the priest.  I'll see if
I can find him. Bye.

[The confessional, inside. Cartman goes through his extensive
list of sins]

CARTMAN
And that was about everything from first
grade. Then last year, well, you can't
tell anybody about this stuff, right?


PRIEST MAXI
Your  con- confession does not leave
this box.

CARTMAN
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich
that the priest of this church had been
eating.

PRIEST MAXI
Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would
forgive you if he knew.

CARTMAN
No, but I'm not finished yet. I took
the sandwich that the priest was eating,
took the piece of ham out of it, put
it between my butt cheeks, and then
put the sandwich back and watched him
eat it.

PRIEST MAXI
I... see.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and then this other time, I went
pee-pee in the holy water thing, and
the priest blessed himself on the forehead
with it every day for about a week.
And then this one time, I was at the
park, and the priest was out walking
his dog and I went-... number two on the
sidewalk and then told officer Barbrady
that it was the priest's dog.  And so
the priest got find like a hundred dollars
for not cleaning it up. And then this
one time, I put super glue all over
the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow!
Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.
Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me
out of here!

SISTER ANNE
Father! I need to talk to you. Father!
I have to ask you a question.

PRIEST MAXI
Okayokay, fine!

CARTMAN
Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.

STAN
What happened??

CARTMAN
I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry
hands of God.  He is an angry God, you
guys. We all have to start taking this
very seriously.

[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. The doorbell rings at Satan and
Chris's condo. Chris walks to the door and opens it]

CHRIS
Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.


SADDAM
And you must be Mr. Assface.  Just kidding.
You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting
me to dinner, guy.  Here, I brought
you a potato.

CHRIS
Oh, thank you.

SATAN
Chris, no! It's a bomb!

CHRIS
Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?


SADDAM
Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here
to act like adults, right?  Oh, gee.
I guess I must've overcooked it.


CHRIS
Well, come on in. Dinner's just about
ready.

[The Broflovski house, day. Sheila and Gerald sit on the living
room sofa, and Ike reads from a book between them]

IKE
behayin' glah, and theh he find de eye.


KYLE'S FATHER
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck
books in one day.

IKE
Cookie monstooh.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, he's groing up so fast!

KYLE
Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Why? What did you do, Kyle?!

KYLE
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't
confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm
gonna go to hell.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us
Jews don't believe in hell.

KYLE
We don't? But what if we're wrong?


KYLE'S MOTHER
Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.


KYLE
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal.
If we're wrong, we burn in hell.

IKE
Oh, no.

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, it's all about being a good person
now! You see, Christians use hell as
a way to scare people into believing
what they believe. But to believe in
something just because you're afraid
of the consequenced if you dont believe
in somethingis no reason to believe
in something. Understand?

IKE
No-o-o.

KYLE
Well, you guys can do what you want!
I'm going down to that church to confess
my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking
Ike with me!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle!

[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Dinner has been served. Saddam,
Satan, and Chris sit at a round table, eating. Satan sits between
the other two.]

CHRIS
So Saddam. Satan told me all about how
you guys almost took over the world
once.

SADDAM
Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What
the hell is this crap we're eating,
anyway?

SATAN
It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was
a nutritionist before he died.

SADDAM
Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell
me, Chris. How is it that you died?


CHRIS
Oh, well I, I actually slipped down
an escalator, in a mall. Those things
can be pretty sketchy.

SADDAM
An escalator? What kind of pussy way
of dying is that?!

CHRIS
L-look, Saddam, I know that you and
Satan had a relationship  And I just
want you to know  that I'm totally okay
with you guys staying friends.

SADDAM
Uh huh.

CHRIS
I think it's important to stay friends
with people you've had relationships
with.  And I know that Satan and my
relationship is strong enough that it
can handle anything.  Right?  Right.


[The church, day. The rectory. Sister Anne, Stan, Cartman, and
Kenny wait for Priest Maxi at his desk. On one side of the desk
is a tray with holders that say, "The LORD Giveth" and "The LORD
Taketh"]

SISTER ANNE
Father, the children asked me about
their handicapped friend. I wanna explain
to them that he's fine.

PRIEST MAXI
Well, has your friend ever confessed
or been baptized?

STAN
I don't think so.

PRIEST MAXI
Then, hell awaits him.

SISTER ANNE
Father, these boys are really worried
because they think they have to-

PRIEST MAXI
They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is
your Christian duty to save the souls
of your friends!

SISTER ANNE
Yes, but-

KYLE
Mister Father!  We have to ask you
something.

PRIEST MAXI
Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?


KYLE
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna
go to hell?

PRIEST MAXI
Well, young man, you can rest assured
that according to Matthew 25, when you
die you will stand before God and he
will will say, "Depart from me, you
cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared
for the devil and his angels." Yes!
As a Jew, your home will be the lake
of fire.

IKE
Oh no.

SISTER ANNE
Father-

PRIEST MAXI
I hope to see all of you in church this
Sunday.

SISTER ANNE
Father, I don't know if I agree fully
with what you're saying. I think that
as long as Jewsih people are good, they
will get into heaven.

PRIEST MAXI
Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior.
I mean, if you don't go to hell for
crucifying the Savior, then what the
hell do you go to hell for?!

[The church, day. The boys stand in front of the candle table
Sister Anne prayed at earlier]

KYLE
Stan! You've got to help us become
good Christians. Please.

STAN
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the
priest: the first thing we have to do
is get you guys all baptized. Come on.


[Cartman's house, day. Timmy, Kyle, and Ike stand in a row as
a hose splashes on each one for a few seconds. Cartman is the
one doing the spraying while Stan and Kenny watch from the steps]


STAN
Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some
more.

CARTMAN
Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!


KYLE
HAAAAH!

CARTMAN
Turn around so I can clean out your
ass.

STAN
Cartman!

CARTMAN
What?

STAN
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a
sin!

CARTMAN
Oh, now you've said it, too!

STAN
Oh, shit!  Oh!

KENNY
(Fuck! Oops!)

CARTMAN
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church
and confess again.

STAN
But what about them?

CARTMAN
Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water
Weasel!

TIMMY
Haaaaah!

STAN
Okay, come on.

TIMMY
Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!

[Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Dinner is over. Chris collects
the dishes]

CHRIS
Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys,
but all that ginger made me tired.


SADDAM
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back.


SATAN
Good. I'll show you out.

CHRIS
Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe
walk back!

SADDAM
Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and
twigs and stuff.  Satan, that guy is
a pussy!

SATAN
He's stable, Saddam!

SADDAM
Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!


SATAN
Having stability in your life is a great
thing! You should try it!

SADDAM
For some people, maybe. But you like
excitement. I know you, Satan.

SATAN
I'm very happy with my life now.

SADDAM
Here.  I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte
Vista. Room 16.

SATAN
No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!


SADDAM
D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep
it, just in case. It was good seeing
you again, Satan. Goodnight.  Goodnight,
pussy! I mean, Chris!

CHRIS
Goodnight

[Rome, St. Peter's Square. A phone rings somwhere and someone
answers]

VOICE
Hello. Your Excellency?  This is Sister
Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling
from the United States?

SECRETARY
Yes, I understand you want to speak-a
wit the pope.

SISTER ANNE
Yes. The priest here has been telling
the children some pretty radical things,
and I just wanted to see what the Church
thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped.


SECRETARY
Yes, well the pope is here, but please
keep it brief. He is a-very old.


THE POPE
Heh??

SISTER ANNE
Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you
about people with mental disabilities.


THE POPE
Heh?

SISTER ANNE
Do mentally-challenged people go to
hell?

THE POPE
Ehhhhh, what's that you say?  Heh?!


SISTER ANNE
Handicap. Mental handicap.

THE POPE
Fibibiibibibibiibibih.

SISTER ANNE
...The priest here said that people with
mental handicaps might end up in hell.
Is that true?

THE POPE
Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih.

[South Park Avenue, day. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are at a crosswalk
waiting for the light to turn green]

STAN
Come on! This stupid light won't change.


TOKEN
Come on! Hurry up!  Hey, what are you
guys doin'?

STAN
We're goin' to church. We've sinned
and so we have to confess again.

BUTTERS
Uh us too. Uhwe saw a picture of a naked
lady. We could see her whole beaver.


CLYDE
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have
unclean souls and we'd burn in hell.


STAN
Uh, come on, let's go.

KENNY
(Yow!)

STAN
...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!


BUTTERS
He had sins that he didn't confess!


CARTMAN
And he never took Communion!

STAN
He's doomed.

CLYDE
...We've gotta get to that church before
we die.

CARTMAN
Yeah.

[Hell, River Styx Condominiums, night. Satan and Chris are in
bed in the dark. Chris is trying to arouse Satan, but Satan doesn't
move]

CHRIS
Yeah.  That's hot.  You take it!  You
take it now!

SATAN
Chris, what are you doing?

CHRIS
I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little
more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's
what you like about sex with Saddam.
I'm just... showin' you that I can be
that way, too.

SATAN
Oh boy.

CHRIS
Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't
you, bitch?  I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take
that.

SATAN
Chris, just... don't... don't do that.


CHRIS
But it turns you on.

SATAN
No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah,
but uh...

CHRIS
But what?

SATAN
Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired
is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep?
Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?


CHRIS
Okay. I love you, Satan.

SATAN
I love you too, Saddam.

SATAN, CHRIS
Wuh?!

SATAN
Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris.


CHRIS
It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand.
...I do.

SATAN
I just need to go get some air. okay?
I'll be back... really quick.

CHRIS
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

[South Park, the church, day. The kids race towards the church]


CARTMAN
Come on, hurry up!

STAN
Oh no! It's locked!

CARTMAN
What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We
have to confess! We have to confess
our sins before we die!

BUTTERS
Hey, there's a window in the back that's
usually open.

STAN
Confession box is over there!

CARTMAN
I'm first, I'm first!

WOMAN
Oh, huhuh.

CARTMAN
What the?

PRIEST MAXI
Whoa!  Son of a bitch!

WOMAN
Eh, heheheheheheh.

PRIEST MAXI
Uhuh. Kids, uh.

STAN
You're a sinner!

CARTMAN
You're doing unnatural things in the
house of God!

PRIEST MAXI
Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh.  Oh, forgive me,
heavenly Father! I've sinned against
you!

CARTMAN
Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!

PRIEST MAXI
M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell!


STAN
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's
gonna save us?

CARTMAN
Well, it looks like we're gonna have
to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else
in this town from the angry hand of
God ourselves!

[Hell. Satan walks down its streets]

DAMNED SOUL
Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain!

SATAN
No, I can't.  What am I doing? I know
this is the wrong thing to do. I could
lose Chris. I can't do this.  I can't
do this.

[South Park, day. A street corner. Cartman holds court on a soapbox.
At least 17 other kids surround him. Some adults look at the
action from across the street]

CARTMAN
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh!
We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh!
Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy
hand offend thee, cut it off!  It is
much better for thee to enter into life
maimed-

RANDY
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!


CARTMAN
-than having two hands to go into hell-uh,-


SISTER ANNE
Oh no.

CARTMAN
-into the fire that will never be quenched!


STAN
Pamphlet. Pamphlet.

CARTMAN
There is only one answer! As kids we
must abandon this town of sin and start
anew!

GIRL
I don't wanna to go to hell.

CARTMAN
It will be a long road, but at the end
of that road is Salvation! And I am
going to lead you there!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 608


"RED-HOT CATHOLIC LOVE"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Catholic Church, day. Organ music plays. Inside,
Priest Maxi is at the pulpit speaking to the congregation]


PRIEST MAXI
Parents, it's that time of year again
when the bishops and priests from around
the country are organizing the Young
Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're
taking the boys on a weekend boat trip
to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator
of our lives.

STAN
That sounds pretty fun.

RANDY
A Catholic boat trip?

SINGER
The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin'
on out today.

The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.

Get some hot Chrisitan action; it'll make you-

RANDY
Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.


[South Park Catholic Church, day. Mass ends and the congregants
go to their cars. A crowd gathers around Randy. The McCormicks
are present.]

RANDY
Look, I just don't think it's the best
idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise
with the priests.

RICHARD
We can let them go, can we?

LINDA STOTCH
There's no way my son's going.

[A black SUV, nearby. Stan, Cartman and Tweek are in the back
seat. Cartman looks out the closed window.]

STAN
What are they talking about?

CARTMAN
I don't know.

TWEEK
Maybe they wanna kill us.

[back to the crowd]

RANDY
With everything that's been in the news,
I think it's best to keep our kids...
far away from the priests.

STUART
Now, come on, everybody, just because
a few priests in the country have been
corrupted doesn't mean that all priests
are child molesters.

RICHARD
Well, sure, that's easy for you to say;
your son's dead. But those of us with
alive children need to be sure that
Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.

SHARON
I've heard about other towns bringing
in counselors that know how to find
things out from kids without really
telling them what's going on.

RANDY
It couldn't hurt.

RICHARD
Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes.


PRIEST MAXI
Uh... Good-bye, everyone.

ALL
Good-bye, Father.

CHRIS
Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow
we'll find an outside counselor and...
find out the truth.

[Park County Community Center, next day. The boys are chattering
when a woman comes in and stands before them.]

COUNSELOR
Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and
I need to ask you a few questions about
your priest, okaaay?

BOYS
Okay.

COUNSELOR
Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi
is... nice? Or mean?

BOYS
Nice.

STAN
Um, cool.

COUNSELOR
Okaaay, what words would you use to
describe your priest?

BUTTERS
Compassionate.

COUNSELOR
Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time,
ever try to put somethig in your butt?


CARTMAN
Ih... in our... butt?

COUNSELOR
You don't need to be ashamed or embarassed.
Just, did he ever try to put anythig
in your butt?

STAN
...Like ...money? What?

BUTTERS
You mean, like a goldfish?

COUNSELOR
No, no. Did he ever try to put anythig
that belonged to him in your butt?


BOYS
No.

[The Community Center, hallway. The parents wait for the counselor
to finish talking with the boys]

THOMAS
This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out
here waitin' to find out if our priest
molested our kids.

MAN
Yeah, what what has Catholicism come
to anyway?

RANDY
You know, I think we've just had it
with the Church. All the horrible things
they've done to kids, I... I think I'm
gonna become an atheist!

RICHARD
That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an
atheist too.

LINDA STOTCH
Let's all be atheists!

ALL
Yeah, yeah, alright.

MAN
If there was a god, why would he let
our kids be molested in the first place?


CHRIS
Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!

RANDY
Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.


CHRIS
...Same thing.

RANDY
Yeah!

[South Park proper, on the curb. Stan, Cartman, and Tweek sit
and think about stuff...]

STAN
What would the priest ...possibly want
to put in our butts?

CARTMAN
Maybe... No.

KYLE
Hey dudes.

STAN, CARTMAN
Hey.

TWEEK
Arr!

KYLE
What are you guys doin'?

STAN
We had to go meet with this counselor
lady, and she asked us if the priest
every put anything in our butts.

KYLE
In your butts?

CARTMAN
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?


KYLE
Why would he puyt anything in your butts?


STAN
We don't know. We're- that's what we're
tryin' to figure out.

CARTMAN
Hm.

KYLE
Hm.

CHEF
Hello there, children!

STAN
Chef! What would a priest want to stick
up my butt?

CHEF
Good-bah!

TWEEK
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This
is going to drive me insane!

KYLE
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a
rational explanation.

CARTMAN
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.


STAN
What?

CARTMAN
It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work
with me on this: if you eat food, you
crap out yoru butt, right?

KYLE
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Alright, now keep working with me here,
it's getting a little complicated. If
you eat food and crap out yoru butt,
then maybe, if you stuck food in your
butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?


KYLE
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've
ever said - this week!

CARTMAN
What, that's not dumb. Think about it:
food goes in the mouth, comes out the
butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out
the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.


KYLE
It wouldn't work!

CARTMAN
Have you ever tried it?

KYLE
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.


CARTMAN
I bet you twenty buck it'll work!

KYLE
You're on, fat boy!

CARTMAN
Okay, let's go, Jew!

PARENTS
Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with
God!

RANDY
Stan, you're an atheist now!

RICHARD
You too, Tweek!

PARENTS
Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with
God!

TWEEK
I'm a what??

[Diocesan headquarters, day. Sixteen priests are present in the
boardroom, with Fatherh Maxi presiding]

PRIEST MAXI
Fathers, I want to thank you all for
coming.

PRIEST 1
No, thank you for finally organizing
an all-priests meeting, Father Maxi.
I think we all agree something has to
be done, quickly.

ELDERLY PRIEST
Well, I don't know how it's been for
all of you, but attendance at my church
in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three
precent!

PRIEST 2
I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.


PRIEST MAXI
Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep
going the way they are, we could lose
our entire religion.

ELDERLY PRIEST
Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from
goin' to the public!

FAT PRIEST
They've gotta know to keep their mouths
shut!

OTHER PRIESTS
That right, yeah.

PRIEST MAXI
Right, and so... wa- wait a minute.
What?

PRIEST 1
Yes, but we've got to find out why these
children are suddenly finding it necessary
to report that they're being molested.
Stop the problem at its source.

PRIEST 2
Yes, but how?

PRIEST 3
Somethng has to be done.

PRIEST 4
We've got to stop this-

PRIEST MAXI
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem
is that children are being molested,
not that they're reporting it!

ELDERLY PRIEST
How do you mean?

PRIEST MAXI
Well, I mean, obviously, what we need
to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct
that is allowed to take place in our
churches, and not just tell the children
not to tell anybody about it. I mean,
right?

PRIEST 1
Well did any of the children you've
molested come forward?

PRIEST MAXI
No.

PRIEST 1
Well, that's good.

PRIEST MAXI
No, I mean! I've never molested any
of the children in my church!

ELDERLY PRIEST
Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all
priests here; the doors are closed.


PRIEST MAXI
Oh for the love of God! Are you all
saying that you've engaged in inappropriate
relations with your altar boys? We are
here to bring the light of God, not
harm the innocent!  I'm serious!

PRIEST 2
Father, uh, having sex with boys is
part of the Catholic priest's way of
life.

OTHER PRIESTS
Yeah.

PRIEST MAXI
Dear God. This problem is much more
severe than I could have possibly imagined.
I have to go to the Vatican and get
help.

[South Park Elementary School, boys' bathroom, day. A group of
fourth-grade boys gather around a toilet as Cartman stands before
it trying to crap into it... with his mouth.]

KYLE
Well, Cartman?

CARTMAN
Hold on!  God, let a man crap!

CRAIG
What's going on?

STAN
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now
he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.


CRAIG
Oh.

KYLE
Well, go on, smartass, and do it!

CARTMAN
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me
a minute!

STAN
You've had five, dude!

CARTMAN
I can't-, I can't do it with you guys
watching. Turn around.

KYLE
No! Because you'll just crap out your
butt and then say it came out of your
mouth!

CARTMAN
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that
deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddamnit
you guys, this si so seriously.

KYLE
Get the fuck out of here!

CARTMAN
Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out
my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!
You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!


[Vatican City, Italy. Father Maxi has made it to St. Peter's
Square. He exits a taxi cab.]

PRIEST MAXI
Well, there you go. Um, grazie.  Wow,
I'm actually here. Vatican City!


ITALIAN CARDINAL
Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from
America. He has brought this all to
our attention.

FATHER MAXI
Your Holiness.

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Adoramus te, Christe.

OTHER CARDINALS
Et dominus...

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an
American priest by the name of-a Maxi
has brought to our attention the most
troubling of news. All over his-a country
there are reports of children being
molested by men of the Chuch. If things
continue this way, we'll never be able
to have sex with young boys again!


FATHER MAXI
That's right-wait. What?

FRENCH CARDINAL
In France as well we are finding it
harder and harder to... make love to
our boys.

MOROCCAN CARDINAL
In Morocco they have arrested five of
my priests. It's only a matter of time
before they get the rest of us.

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Father Maxi, what do you suggest we
do to not get caught.

FATHER MAXI
Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what
we should do is not have sex with boys!


ITALIAN CARDINAL
It is not written anywhere in the Holy
Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a
boys is wrong..

FATHER MAXI
Well, maybe we need to change the Holy
Document of Vatican Law.

BRITISH CARDINAL
Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics,
it is obvious that the priest doesn't
realize that the Holy Document of Vatican
Law can not be changed!

THE CLERGY
Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!


GELGAMEK CARDINAL
Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek
Catholics, I believe we should move
on to other solutions to this problem.


PRIEST MAXI
Gelgameks?

[Kyle's house, night. Cartman walks alone to the front door and
rings the doorbell. Kyle comes to answer it. He opens the door...]


CARTMAN
Kyle, could you help me out? I need
some advice.

KYLE
What?

CARTMAN
It's just that... I can't decide what
to buy with your twenty dollars!  I
was thinking of getting this mega-man
racer for $19.95, or I could get two
Broncos trading packs for ten apiece.
And then I thought-

[Stan's house, dinnertime. Sharon brings out hanburgers from
the kitchen]

RANDY
Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't
have to pray for our food.

SHARON
That's right, everyone just dig in.
So, kids,anything happen with your
whole Sunday off?

STAN
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his
ass and crapped out his mouth.

SHARON
Stanley!

STAN
What? He did.

RANDY
Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.


STAN
Yeah it does.

RANDY
No it doesn't.

STAN
Yeah. It does.

[Stan's house, bedtime. Randy is in his pajamas kneeling before
the toilet. He's now trying to crap out his mouth. After much
effort, a log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet.
Randy is stunned]

RANDY
Honey! Honey, come quick!

[St. Peter's Square, day. Father Maxi is trying to get his point
across]

PRIEST MAXI
Look, people! I'm just trying to say
that if we don't change the Holy Document
of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone
to atheism!

FRENCH CARDINAL
What exactly do you suggest we change,
Father Maxi.

PRIEST MAXI
Well, for one, no sex with boys.

ANOTHER CARDINAL
The Holy Document of Vatican Law states
that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot
get married, so where are we to get
our sex?

PRIEST MAXI
Uh well then, perhaps we could change
the Holy Document of Vatican Law to
say that... it's okay for a priest or
bishop or cardinal to have sex... with
women.

FRENCH CARDINAL
Women?

GELGAMEK CARDINAL
The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide
and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do
you really expect us to have sex with
them?!

PRIEST MAXI
Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget
about the Gelgameks for a second and
focus-

GELGAMEK CARDINAL
What's that about the Gelgameks?!


PRIEST MAXI
I'm just saying, what works on planet
Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta
work for the rest of us here, on Earth.
You see? That's the problem we're having
here.

ITALIAN CARDINAL
But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law
cannot be changed!

PRIEST MAXI
Why not?!

ANOTHER CARDINAL
Because we don't know where it is.


ITALIAN CARDINAL
You see, Father, the Holy Document of
Vatican Law has been hidden away deep
in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below
us. Hidden away so that it can never
be changed.

PRIEST MAXI
But if we locate it we can make changes
to it?

A BISHOP
HA! Good luck, father! The document
is guarded by water lizards, rattle
snakes and sand traps! The fools who
have tried before to recover it met
their deaths!

PRIEST MAXI
Well we have to try. Our religion is
dying!

[Stan's house. He, Kyle, and Tweek watch television. The front
door closes off screen.]

CARTMAN
You guys! You guys! Look!

TWEEK
Harrr!

CARTMAN
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's
twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty
single-dollar bills.

STAN
So?

CARTMAN
So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess,
Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!


KYLE
Go fuck yourself, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.


KYLE
Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your
ass!

CARTMAN
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's
over, okay? I won. Let it go.

KYLE
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good
for you! It's still stupid and immature!


STAN
Dude, look.

NEWS ANCHOR
Our top story tonight, the age-old
question has been answered: if I put
food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth?
All over the country, people are discovering
that, yes, in fact, you will.  The sugeon-general
had this to say:

SURGEON-GENERAL
And the uh immediate research shows
that the act is not only amusing, but
in fact much healthier for out bodies
than the old way of eating.  You see,
food entering through the anus has the
benefit of being broken down on its
way to the stomach rather than afterward.
And therefore I believe that interorectogestion
would actually put a stop to high cholesterol
and most kinds of stomach cancers. And
I base that on absolutely nothing.


NEWS ANCHOR
The Surgeon-General's response has made
Americans change their eating habits
almost instantly.

CARTMAN
That's stupid and immature, Cartman!


KYLE
It is stupid and immature! So you got
people to crap out of their mouths!
What do you want, a feakin' medal?!


NEWS ANCHOR
The Mayor of South Park has announced
that for first discovering this healthy
way of eating, young citizen  Eric Cartman
will be given... a freaking medal.


KYLE
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

[A kitchen set in a studio, day. An attractive woman is busy
preparing a dish on the stove]

ANNOUNCER
Now, with more on "Martha Stewart's
Living" .

MARTHA STEWART
In the past few days we've all heard
of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion,
and so making food that can be inserted
into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone
knows that some foods are simple to
shove up the ass - puddings, soups,
raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding
right here - but we can also still eat
our favorite foods. What we're gonna
do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey
for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving
a turkey up your ass is first wrapping
it in string, keeping the pointy wings
neatly at the side.

FBI AGENT
Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.


MARTHA STEWART
Not right now, I just wanna focus on
my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going
to baste the turkey with lubricating
gel rather than with juice - this'll
help smooth the insertion later on.
We still bake at four hundred degrees
for twenty minutes a pound.  When it's
done we'll get something like this.
So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious.
Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get
it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh.
Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey.
We'll be right back with more.

[The Catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica. Father Maxi, with
torch in hand, walks down a hall past walls with writing on them.
He descends some stairs and crosses a large room, stopping at
a door behind which there is a brightly-lit room.]

OLD MONK
Beoo!

PRIEST MAXI
Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi,
from the United States.

OLD MONK
What do you seek, Father?

PRIEST MAXI
I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document
of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make
revisions to it.

OLD MONK
That Gospel...  lies somewhere beyond
this door.  But... many troubles await
thee inside! Only he whose heart truly
belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.


PRIEST MAXI
I have to try. Our religion is in trouble,
and... and that scroll may be our only
hope!

OLD MONK
Then, prepare yourself. The time of
trials begins.  Adoramus te, Christe!
I wish you luck, Father. Use all the
strength, agility, and faith that you
have.

PRIEST MAXI
Very well. Here we go.  Hmmm, there's
a ladder up here.  Oh my God, a rattlesnake!
A way back up!  I've made it! Praise
be to God! He hath shown me the way!
This must be it. The Holy Document
of Vatican Law.

RANDY
Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great
time bein' atheist. I for one can't
believe I used to live my life by what
a very old and very fictional book used
to say.

LINDA STOTCH
Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch
of stories about people in robes slaughtering
goats have to do with today's world?


RICHARD
Atheism has definitely made our lives
better.

SHARON
I made some quesadillas, if anybody
wants some.

ALL
Ooohh.

SHARON
And if anybody needs to potty, there's
a potty basket right here.

RICHARD
Oh thanks, Sharon.

MAN
You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're
worried we might have a hard time raising
our son atheist. I mean-  whoa, thank
you -I mean,  it could end up being
very difficult raising an atheist child
in such a Christian society.  I feel
that everywhere my poor son goes he's
being persecuted for his beliefs.


RICHARD
That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son
to be atheist, I don't want him saying
"under God" every day at school. That
could really damage him. "Under God"
should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse
me.  Moowwaaagh.  "Under God" should
be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.


RANDY
That's right, I agree.  And it should
be taken off of money as well.  The
religious right in this country is trying
to force our children to believe what
they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let
the religious right corrupt our kids.


ALL
That's right, that's right.

[St. Peter's Basilica, day. ]

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father
Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy
Document of-a Vatican Law!

BRITISH CARDINAL
How did he make it past the water lizards?


PRIEST MAXI
Yes, I have returned with the Holy
Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE,
change it now to say, "It's NOT okay
to have sex with boys"?

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say
something.  The pope-a says we shall
ask the highest source.

PRIEST MAXI
Oh my.

ITALIAN CARDINAL
The holy one!  Behold the great Queen
Spider!

THE CLERGY
Hail Queen Spider!

PRIEST MAXI
Queen spider?

ITALIAN CARDINAL
O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your
guidance.

QUEEN SPIDER
What do you ask of me?

BRITISH CARDINAL
Great Queen Spider, we seek to change
one of the Vatican rules.

QUEEN SPIDER
The Vatican rules cannot be changed.
So saith the Spider

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince
her.

PRIEST MAXI
Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!!
You people have completely lost touch
with the outside world! You sit in this
big room with your Gelgameks and your
Queen Spider, and none of it applies
to what being a Catholic is all about!!


A BISHOP
But the Holy Document of Vatican Law
states that-

PRIEST MAXI
To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican
Law!!

[South Park, day. The boys stand in front of Stan's house]

CARTMAN
You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's
twenty dollars down to the bank again,
and I got it changed into quarters!


KYLE
So?

CARTMAN
So now I can dump them into this little
pool and swim in them all day long!
Yeessss. Kyle's monneey.

KYLE
Cartman, there's something I need to
tell you.

CARTMAN
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?

KYLE
You were totally, one hundred percent
right.

CARTMAN
Heh...  what?

KYLE
You won the bet. You were totally accurate
about being able to crap out your mouth,
and I've just been frustrated because
I didn't think of it first. I want you
to enjoy that money because... you really
impressed me with your insight and...
I'm... proud to have you as a friend.


CARTMAN
You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!!


A MAN
Yeah, the pope is gone!

RANDY
Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning
down!

LINDA STOTCH
Score one for us atheists

RICHARD
Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it
on TV!

[Vatican City, day. The clergy mill around in the ruins of the
Vatican.]

ITALIAN CARDINAL
Gone! It's all gone!

BRITISH CARDINAL
Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've
killed our religion.

PRIEST MAXI
No I didn't! All that's dead are your
stupid laws and rules!  You've forgotten
what being a Catholic is all about.
This... book. You see, these are just
stories.  Stories that are meant to
help people in the right direction.
Love your neighbor. Be a good person.
That's it! And when you start turning
the stories into literal translations
of hierarchies and power, well... Well,
you end up with this.  People are losing
faith because they don't see how what
you've turned the religion into applies
to them! They've lost touch with any
idea of any kind of religion, and when
they have no mythology to try and live
their lives by, well, they just start
spewing a bunch of crap out of their
mouths!

RICHARD
...What was that last bit?

PRIEST MAXI
Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic.
But I'm a Catholic in the real world.
In today's world! It's time for you
all to do that, too. It is time... for
change.

[Stan's house, after the telecast]

RANDY
He's right, Sharon. We don't have to
believe every word of the Bible. They're
just stories to help us to live by.
We shouldn't toss away the lessons of
the Bible just because some assholes
in Italy screwed it up.

SHARON
O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my
butt anymore.

RANDY
Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.


STAN
Does this mean we have to go to church
on Sundays again?

RANDY
No. It means we get to, son. It means...
we get to.

ACT I

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY

The Booktastic Bus, a rainbow colored bookmobile, is parked
out in front of the school.

GARRISON
Okay, children. Each of you gets to
choose two books from the booktastic
bus.

CARTMAN
Reading sucks ass.

GARRISON
Eric! Shut up!

The boys are looking at a wide selection of books that adorn
the shelves of the bookmobile.

KYLE
Boring... Boring... Gay... Boring...
Boring.

Stan digs at the front of the bookmobile.

STAN
Hey you guys, check out these books.

The other boys join him.

STAN
(reading the cover)
'Sabrina Unchained'.

The boys all grab books in the Sabrina series.

KYLE
Wow, these books look cool!

The boys open them. Their eyes grow wide.

CARTMAN
(Flipping through)
Hey, there's a lot of big words in
these books!

KENNY
Mrm pr mpm rpm rpmrp!

Just then the Bookmobile driver, a fruity little guy wearing
a rainbow shirt, notices them.

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
Hello kids! I see you're discovering
the magic of reading!

KYLE
Who are you?

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
I drive the booktastic bus! Where
magic begins! You see, reading opens
up whole new worlds to you. You can
take a canoe down the Amazon, or go
back in time to Camelot, or become a
race car driver... all by just opening
a book. Just like magic! The magic
of reading!

CARTMAN
God, shut up, dude.

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
Go ahead and pick any books you like.
Then give in... Give in to the magic!

He skips away.

STAN
If we read are we gonna become like
that guy?

KYLE
Yeah, this is stupid. Books aren't
magical.

CARTMAN
I don't know, I'm kind of getting a
tingly feeling looking at these...

Cartman is looking at Sabrina Unchained.

The boys hear some commotion from across the street. It's a
loud, screaming chicken, followed by some screams.

KENNY
Mph mmph?

STAN
I don't know. Let's go see.

EXT. SOUTH PARK STREET - EST.

INT. BARBRADY'S CAR - DAY

Barbrady is driving in his car as a COPS film crew shoots
him. Everything is shot in COPS style. A TITLE at the bottom
reads 'Officer Barbrady South Park P.D.'

BARBRADY
Well, being an officer of the peace
means a lot of things. It's a hard
job, but then again, I'm a hard man.
A lot of people think that in a small
town there isn't a lot for the law
to do, well, they're wrong.

EXT. CUTAWAY OF BARBRADY'S CAR

RADIO
All units, all units, report to 254
Avenue De Los Mexicanos.

INT. BARBRADY'S CAR - MOVING

RADIO
...Possible hostile situation.

Barbrady throws on his lights and speeds away.

BARBRADY
There! You see! This could be a bank
robbery! Or possibly even a MURDER!
This ain't no podunk little town!

RADIO
And Barbrady, your wife called she
wants you to get some pizza on the
way home.

BARBRADY
God dammit!

EXT. RANCH - DAY

Title "Hostile Situation Downtown South Park".

The boys have already joined an angry crowd that has gathered
around a chicken cage.

Barbrady pulls up in his car, followed by the COPS camera
crew.

BARBRADY
Okay people, move along! There's
nothing to see here!

Barbrady gets up to the rancher.

BARBRADY
What's the trouble? Where's the body?!

RANCHER
Barbrady! I just caught some guy in
here having sex with one of my
chickens!!

Barbrady looks kind of embarrassed. He glances at the cops
crew.

BARBRADY
Uh... Oh.

The Rancher points to the cage. Inside, is a normal looking
chicken, eating some feed.

WOMAN
My God! That's disgusting!

STAN
Whoa dude! How do you have sex with
a chicken!

BARBRADY
Boys! You move along, this isn't for
young eyes to see!

The boys don't move.

BARBRADY
Did you get a good look at the
suspect?

RANCHER
Naw I didn't see anything! It just
happened so fast.

The COPS crew roll their eyes.

BARBRADY
Well, this is quite interesting, huh
guys?

COPS CAMERAGUY
Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch
and maybe get some shots of those
turtles down at the pond.

The Cops crew walks away. Barbrady is bummed.

BARBRADY
Aw, camel poo.

KYLE
Hey, what's this?

Kyle picks up a piece of paper off the ground.

STAN
It look's like a note.

BARBRADY
(grabbing the note)
Give me that! That's a clue and you'll
get your stinky DNA all over it!

RANCHER
What does it say?

Over Barbrady's shoulder, we can see that it reads:

Another chicken gets it tomorrow!

Barbrady looks at the note and studies it for a second. He
appears to have trouble focusing on it.

BARBRADY
Uh... it says... Uh... Sorry I had
sex with a chicken, I won't do it
again. Bye-bye."

Barbrady folds the note and puts it away.

BARBRADY
Well, there you have it. Case closed.

RANCHER
Damnit Barbrady, what the hell's
wrong with you? Every time something
happens in this town you say, 'nothing
to see here', and 'case closed'. But
we want justice! We have to find
this sick-o.

BARBRADY
I said return to you homes! Before I
start arresting people!

PRIEST
For what? ORDERLY conduct!

BARBRADY
How about fishing without a license?

RANCHER
I'm not fishing!!!

BARRBADY
What do you call this then?

Barbrady pulls out a fishing pole from behind him.

BARBRADY
If you do not comply, I'll be forced
to execute each and every one of you
by gunshot to the head!!!

The crowd disperses, one by one.

BARBRADY
That's right, return to your simple
lives, just forget this ever happened.
Forget... FOR-GET...

Finally everyone but the boys is gone, and Barbrady walks
off.

KYLE
Wow... Barbrady sure is acting weird.

STAN
Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.

EXT. BARBRADY'S CAR - PARKED - EST.

Barbrady get's in the front seat and slams the door behind
him.

INT. BARBRADY'S CAR - PARKED

We see his point of view as he looks at the note found on
the ground.

It is written in Greek.

Barbrady sighs deeply, then crumples up the note and speeds
off.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Barbrady pulls up to a familiar red Stop sign. He looks at
it. It has Klingon letters on it.

EXT. FRAN'S DRIVE-THRU

Barbrady pulls up to the speaker.

SPEAKER
Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?

Barbrady looks at the menu. From his POV, the letters seem
to be twisting and turning incoherently. They don't make any
sense.

SPEAKER
Sir, can I help you?

The letters come to life, they seem to laugh at Barbrady.

BARBRADY
Uh... Just give me two cheeseburgers
and some jalapeno poppers.

SPEAKER
Sure, there's just one problem.

OFFICER BARBRADY
What's that?

SPEAKER
We're a bank.

Sure enough, right on top of the speaker is a sign that says
in big letters "Fran's National Bank".

BARBRADY
I know that, smarty-pants! What, do
you think I'm some kind of idiot?

SPEAKER
Yes.

Barbrady thinks for a moment.

BARBRADY
Hmm.

Finally, he speeds off.

INT. BARBRADY'S CAR - DRIVING

BARBRADY
I can't go on living this lie!

INT. TELEVISION

A graphic of scared chickens is beside the anchor's head.

ANCHOR
With chicken after chicken being
violated, the South Park police are
under increasing pressure to solve
the case of the chickenfucker. We
now go live to a press conference
where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor
are fielding questions --

INT. POLICE STATION

Barbrady stands behind a podium with mics in his face.

REPORTER
Officer Barbrady, what would drive a
man to such a disgusting act?

BARBRADY
Well, nobody can say for sure. No
motive has yet been established.

REPORTER
Do the police have any leads?

BARBRADY
Well, both 3-D computer modelling
and intensive seismology have not
given us any leads as of yet.

REPORTER #2
But has chickenfucker left any clues
at the crime -- ?

BARBRADY
ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! I CAN'T READ!!!

Silence. Barbrady's voice reverberates for a second. Everyone
else stands in shock.

BARBRADY
There I said it! I can't read! Are
you happy now? You pushed and you
pushed and now you all know my
terrible secret!! I'm illegitimate!!
I'M NOT FIT TO BE A POLICEMAN!! I
RETIRE!!!

Barbrady storms off Silence. Nobody says anything.

MAN
Okay, thank you all for coming.
There's coffee and brownies out front.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

ANCHOR
And so, Officer Barbrady has taken a
leave of absence. And South Park
will have to manage without any police
force for a while --

A brick suddenly lands on the anchor's desk. He reads off
it.

ANCHOR
-- This just in! South Park has just
plunged into TOTAL ANARCHY!! Exactly
2 seconds after the retirement of
Officer Barbrady, looting and
pillaging erupted in the quiet
mountain town!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Once again the town is being destroyed. Only this time, it
is by the citizens themselves. Buildings are on fire. Women
and men booze it up. Cars crash into buildings.

TOWNSPERSON
Whoopeee! This is killer!!

TOWNSMAN
With no cops around, we can do
whatever we want!

The boys are watching the South Park riots from across the
street.

KYLE
Woa, dude, what's going on?

STAN
I don't know.

Some random people overturn a car. It lands on top of Kenny.

STAN
OH MY GOD!! THEY'VE KILLED --

But then, the overturned car door opens, and Kenny walks
out, brushing himself off.

STAN
Oh, never mind.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE

The mayor is looking out the window at the chaos.

MAYOR
I don't believe it... All this time
Barbrady actually did keep this town
peaceful.

ASSISTANT #2
Who knew? I always thought he was a
complete idiot...

MAYOR
He is...

Suddenly, all the reporters break into the Mayor's office.

REPORTER
Mayor! What do you plan to do about
the South Park riots?

MAYOR
(holding up her hands)
No reason for concern. I want to
assure all of you -- that Officer
Barbrady is STILL our active police
force.

REPORTER
But he's illiterate. What do you
plan to do?

MAYOR
Uh, plan? I don't actually --

The Mayor's assistant pops in frame and answers for her.

ASSISTANT
Reading classes. Plain and simple.
By the Mayor's order, Officer Barbrady
is on a temporary leave of absence
to learn to read. Effective
immediately.

MAYOR
Yes, that's right. It's back to school
with Officer Barbrady!

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing.

INT. CLASSROOM

Garrison stands at the head of the class.

MR. GARRISON
Now children, we have a new student
joining us today. Please say hi to
Officer Barbrady.

Barbrady is sitting in the middle of the kids, sticking out
like a sore thumb.

STAN
(Behind Barbrady)
I can't see, dude!

MR. GARRISON
Okay, now since our focus has been
on reading, let's review some of the
basics.

Barbrady raises his hand.

MR. GARRISON
Yes, what is it?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I need to go poopies.

Garrison thinks.

MR. GARRISON
Officer Barbrady, in school we go to
the bathroom before and after class.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?!

GARRISON
Now, does anyone have any suggestions
where we should begin with Officer
Barbrady?

KYLE
How about a brain transplant?

GARRISON
Now Kyle, let's be supportive of our
new student give him the nurturing
environment he needs to thrive. Now,
I'm going to write a sentence, and I
want us all to help Officer Barbrady
read it.

Garrison writes a sentence on the blackboard; 'Oprah Winfrey
has huge knockers.'

MR. GARRISON
Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh... O... O...

MR. GARRISON
BZZZT!!! WRONG!! Try again, dumbass!!

Garrison slaps his knee and laughs.

GARRISON
(drying his eyes)
Okay, okay... Maybe we should try
something a little easier. We can
work our way up to the hard ones --

He writes 'The hat is red.' on the board.

GARRISON
Go ahead, Barbrady. Don't be scared.

BARBRADY
Uh....... O.....

GARRISON
BZZZZZ!!!!! DER!! DID YOU HEAR THAT
MR. HAT?!!!

MR. HAT
I SURE DID MR. GARRISON!!! WHAT A
RETARD!!!

Garrison laughs so hard he falls on the floor. He just laughs
and laughs and laughs.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Did you kids actually learn how to
read this way?

STAN
No, we just fake it to shut him up.

Garrison is up at the front, still laughing and tearing up.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, okay, I'm sorry... I'm
sorry..Let's try again...

EXT. SOUTH PARK - FARM

Three chickens are in their coop, bawking quietly.

Then, a human shadow falls over the chickens as the door the
coop opens. The chickens look over and rustle their feathers.

VOICE (O.S.)
Say... What are nice chickens like
you doing in a coop like this?

ACT II

EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

Establishing.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

The kids and Barbrady sit in their desks.

MR. GARRISON
Now children, I hope you all had a
good time reading your books, and
are prepared for your book reports.

Cartman looks around nervously.

MR. GARRISON
Who should we have go first, Mr.
Hat? Let's see...

CARTMAN
(Throwing his voice)
Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?

MR. GARRISON
Eric, why don't you go first.

CARTMAN
Ooh...

MR. GARRISON
What's the matter, Eric? Are you not
prepared again?

CARTMAN
I'm prepared!

Cartman storms to the front.

CARTMAN
(Hands behind back)
For my book report, I read 'The Lion
The Witch and the Wardrobe'. It was
very very good. Have you read it Mr.
Garrison?

MR. GARRISON
No, I can't say that I have.

CARTMAN
(Lighting up)
Oh, good!
(Happily)
In 'The Lion, The Witch and the
Wardrobe', a bunch of, uh, hippies
walk around and paint stuff. They
eat lunch, and then they find a
magical... camel, which they have to
eat to stay alive. And that's pretty
much it, I give it a B minus.

Cartman smiles broadly.

MR. GARRISON
And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit
down.

CARTMAN
Aw, DAMMIT!

The kids all laugh merrily.

MR. GARRISON
Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't
you give us your book report?

Barbrady walks up to the front.

OFFICER BARBRADY
I have just finished reading the
heart warming novel 'Go Dog Go'. I
found it a compelling and disturbing
look at the canine psyche'. If I may
read a passage:

Barbrady pulls out the book.

OFFICER BARBRADY
(Reading)
Big dog..... Little dog..... A red
dog..... On a.....

The kids blink.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, anyway, I don't want to give
away the ending, but I will say that
it spirals toward an incredible twist
turn that parallels my own life.

Barbrady heads back to his desk.

MR. GARRISON
Thank you, Officer Barbrady, that
was a very good book report, indeed.
I'll give you an A.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hooray!!

CARTMAN
(Quietly, to Barbrady)
Goodie two-shoes!!

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

PAN along the playground, where all the children are enjoying
various activities.

SETTLE on the swingset, where Barbrady and Kenny and a little
girl are swinging.

BARBRADY
(Singing)
Swingset, swingset up and down I
go... Whoosh goes the willy wind
blowing through my toes...

Stan, Kyle and Cartman stand off to the side, tossing a red
ball back and forth.

STAN
Dude, I think Officer Barbrady enjoys
being at school at little too much.

KYLE
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be
learning how to read?

Barbrady swings higher on the swingset, higher.

BARBRADY
SWINGSET! SWINGSET! UP AND DOWN I
GOOO!!!!

Suddenly, the Mayor and her assistants walk in.

MAYOR
OFFICER BARBRADY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

Suddenly, Barbrady stops swinging. The force of the sudden
stop causes Kenny to fly out of his swing, and smash into a
brick wall.

STAN
Oh, my God! They killed --

Kenny gets up and waves it off.

STAN
Oh, never mind.

MAYOR
Well, how's the reading coming along?!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh, pretty good...

MAYOR
Barbrady... We really need you to
speed this up. The chickenfucker
struck again last night.

KYLE
Oh, no!

BARBRADY
Oh Mayor please, when we're around
children we prefer to call him the
Chicken LOVER.

ASSISTANT
This time he made love to Carla
Weathers prize chicken. She's
catatonic

OFFICER BARBRADY
Who, Carla Weathers or the chicken?

MAYOR
The perpetrator left this clue at
the crime scene.

BARBRADY
I can't read this, it has silent
e's.

The Mayor gets in Barbrady's face.

MAYOR
You have to learn to read faster,
Barbrady!

BARBRADY
I'm doing the best I can!! I even
got an A on my book report!

MAYOR
Listen, buddy, either you learn to
read QUICK or else I'm going to find
a law officer to replace you FOREVER!!

The Mayor and her assistants walk off.

While leaving, one of the assistants grabs the red ball from
the boys and pops it.

The boys look sad.

ASSISTANT #2
Hey, What'd ya do that for?

ASSISTANT
Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry.

They all leave.

Barbrady looks sad as the other boys gather around him.

BARBRADY
Oh boy, I am in big trouble... I'll
never learn to read fast enough, and
the town is in chaos.

STAN
It's cool dude, we'll help you.

BARBRADY
Hey, that's right... You CAN help
me!! Under Article 39 section 2 of
Police code, I am allowed to deputize
citizens in a time of crisis.

Cartman eyes light up!

CARTMAN
REALLY? I wanna be a cop!

BARBRADY
You boys will be my deputies, you
can help me restore order, catch the
chickenlover, and swing me on the
swingset.

CARTMAN
Do I get a nightstick?!

BARBRADY
Sure, nightsticks for everybody!!

Barbrady throws Cartman his night stick.

BARBRADY
You keep a tab on crime in the city,
and we'll try to solve the
chickenlover case!

CARTMAN
10-4, Sergeant!

Cartman dashes off.

BARBRADY
Now, what did that clue say again?

STAN
'If you want to know where I'll strike
next, read Bumbly Wumbly And the
Spotted Spacecraft'!

BARBRADY
To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We
haven't a moment to spare!

BOYS
Hooray!!

EXT. BOOKMOBILE - DAY

Establishing.

INT. BOOKMOBILE

The boys burst in.

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
Good day good friends! Welcome to
the magical world of reading.

BARBRADY
We need a copy of "Bumbly Wumbly and
the Spotted Spacecraft" right away!

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
Ooooow! That's a very magical book,
full of wondrous --

BARBRADY
Aw, just give us the damn book,
fruitcake!

The driver hands over the book. Barbrady opens it.

KYLE
What's it say?

BARBRADY
It says 'Mah... Mah...' Uh, what's
this word?

STAN
I.

BARBRADY
Oh yeah, 'I... Mah... Mah...'

KYLE
Here give me that.
(Reading)
'I am Bumbly Wumbly, I live in the
pond'.

STAN
A pond. Hey, maybe that means Stark's
Pond.

BARBRADY
That's quick thinking, deputy! Let's
get to Stark's pond immediately!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Starsky and Hutch THEME MUSIC kicks in as Cartman comes
driving in a BIG-WHEEL cop car.

Cartman puts on some shades as he drives down the street,
chewing gum and feeling ultra cool.

Suddenly, a nice car speeds past him.

CARTMAN
Hey!

Cartman hits the uplights and sirens.

The car pulls over. Cartman gets out of the Big wheel, pulls
up his pants and approaches the car.

He knocks on the window with his billy club. Stan's dad rolls
it down.

STAN'S DAD
Yes Officer?

CARTMAN
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour
back there. Do you know what the
speed limit is here?

STAN'S DAD
Well according to that sign right
there, it's 40 miles an hour.

Sure enough, there is a sign right in front of them that
reads 'SPEED LIMIT 40 MILES AN HOUR.'

CARTMAN
Step out of the car please, sir.

STAN'S DAD
(Stepping out)
Wait a second, aren't you Stan's
little friend?

CARTMAN
Sir, step out of the car please.

STAN'S DAD
Yeah! You're the one who always plugs
up the toilet at our house.

CARTMAN
AY! I'm a COP! And you WILL respect
my authority.

STAN'S DAD
(laughs)
Yeah right! You better get back to
school, little boy.

Cartman takes out his nightstick.

CARTMAN
GET YOUR ASS TO JAIL!

Suddenly, Cartman smacks Stan's Dad in the knee with his
nightstick.

STAN'S DAD
Ow!!! Hey what the hell are you doing?
You can't do that!... Ow!

CARTMAN
Sweet.

Cartman starts beating Stan's dad senseless.

EXT. STARK'S POND - NIGHT

A small crowd has gathered around a solitary chicken that
looks completely normal and eats feed.

BARBRADY
Oh weak, dude, we're too late!

STAN
Well, the chickens don't seem to
really mind.

PRIEST
Well this is terrible. Now who would
have sex with a chicken?

HALFIE
I would!

Everyone looks over.

MR. GARRISON
You couldn't screw anything, halfie!
You don't have any legs!!

HALFIE
Oh... yeah.

Halfie walks on his arms away. The priest calls after him.

PRIEST
Have some respect for people's
feelings! Would ya Halfie?

Kyle, Stan and Barbrady run up.

BARBRADY
Come on, dudes, we need to look for
another clue.

Kyle starts searching the ground. Stan follows.

KYLE
Here! Here!! I found one!

STAN
What's it say? What's it say?!!!

KYLE
It says read 'Teetle the Timid Taxa...
Taxa..' the Taxi... What's this word?

STAN
I don't know.

Kyle turns to Barbrady.

BARBRADY
(struggling to read)
'T...Ta....Ta... TAXIDERMIST!!

Everyone gasps. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC blows, Barbrady looks
extremely proud of himself. A few townspeople applaud.

BARBRADY
I read it! I read it all by myself!

Everyone CHEERS.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Video style footage of Cartman on his Big Wheel.

*NOTE - All of the following scene should parody COPS.

CARTMAN
Yeah, I've been working this beat
for about three days now... You
definitely have to have pretty thick
skin, or else these people they just
walk all over you. Sometimes you
have to go undercover to get the
worst of 'em.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

Cartman is standing in the street, still in COP gear, but
with a pink skirt around his waist.

He is walking up and down the street pretending to be a
hooker. A title comes up 'Prostitution Sting 9:42 p.m.
westside.'.

Finally a car comes pulling up.

MAN
Hi there, little lady.

CARTMAN
Well hi there. What are you doing
tonight?

MAN
Well, hopefully spending some time
with you, gorgeous. Is twenty dollars
enough?

CARTMAN
Sir, step out of the car please.

MAN
What? Oh oh, is this a bust?

CARTMAN
Sir, step out of the car.

The guy gets out.

MAN
Hey wait a minute... You're just a
KID!

CARTMAN
Maybe THIS will teach you to listen
to AUTHORITY!!!

Cartman smacks the guy in the shins.

MAN
OWWWW!!!... Owwww. Hey man, what are
you doing? Owww, stop it.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Cartman's back on his big wheel.

CARTMAN
(To camera)
Yeah, sometimes upholding the law is
messy. But you get by...

FADE TO TITLE 'CARTMAN' written like 'COPS'

CARTMAN
...One day at a time.

FADE OUT:

ACT III

EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Establishing.

TOWNSPERSON
I got a TV. Shhhh come on.

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Barbrady is alone at a large desk with a huge book in front
of him.

BARBRADY
(Reading)
Teetle the timid Taxidermist... Loves
to...
(to himself)
Oh, God damn reading is lame!

Stan and Kyle walk up.

KYLE
How's it going, dude?

BARBRADY
Terrible. I give up. I'm not fit to
be a cop!!

Barbrady breaks down crying.

STAN
Come on dude, it's not that hard!

BARBRADY
IT IS TOO!!

KYLE
Just read the sentence.

BARBRADY
Teetle the Timid taxidermist, loves
to go to the pet -- pet --

KYLE
Come on, dumbass, you can do it!

BARBRADY
Pet... Wait a minute...

A flashback balloon of Mr. Garrison pops up.

MR. GARRISON
Conjugate the verb... Conjugate the
verb.

MR. HAT
Yes, conjucate the verb.

DRAMATIC MUSIC! Barbrady stands up.

BARBRADY
PetTING. PETTING ZOO. He loves to go
to the petting zoo!! Boys! We're
off!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

Cartman is driving his big wheel down the street. (Everything
is shot from a 'passenger' seat POV)

A small TITLE reads "Dep. Eric Cartman Street Patrol".

Suddenly, a crackling comes over the radio.

RADIO
All units, all units 512 at 635 Avenue
De Los Mexicanos, request
assistance...

Cartman hits his lights and drives faster down the street.

EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE

Now the TITLE changes to 'Domestic Disturbance 4:38 pm Lower
East Side'.

Cartman walks up to the door and knocks on it with his
nightstick.

The door opens to reveal Kenny's father.

CARTMAN
Sir, could you step out of the car
please?

KENNY'S DAD
We're fine, officer.

The video camera ZOOMS IN to reveal that Kenny's Dad has a
black eye.

CARTMAN
And, uh, who, who's in here with
you?

KENNY'S DAD
Just me and my wife and my brother,
and my wife's cousin and his son and
my brother's girlfriend and our two
kids --

Kenny and his brother appear in the doorway.

KENNY
Mrph mrmmh mremm.

KENNY'S DAD
-- and my brother's girlfriend's
mother and this guy Bob who I met
last year.

CARTMAN
(To camera)
Poor people tend to live in clusters.

KENNY'S DAD
What, what did you say?

CARTMAN
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some
kind of --

Suddenly, Kenny's mom appears in the doorway.

KENNY'S MOTHER
I WANT HIM OUT OF MY HOUSE! HE AIN'T
WORTH A (BEEP) HE CAN'T EVEN HOLD A
(BEEEP) JOB!!

KENNY'S DAD
SHUT UP, BITCH!

Kenny looks at his mother.

CARTMAN
Okay, let's try to watch the language.
There's children present here.

KENNY'S MOTHER
YOU LAZY ASS MOTHER(BEEEP)!

KENNY'S DAD
LOOK WHAT SHE DID TO MY (BEEEP)ING
EYE!!!

KENNY'S MOTHER
I'LL DO IT AGAIN!

Kenny's mom smacks his dad in the eye. Kenny laughs his ass
off.

KENNY'S BROTHER
Mom hit dad again.

CARTMAN
(To camera)
Now, the first thing to do in domestic
disturbance calls like this one is
to just calm everybody down.
(To parents)
RESPECT MY AUTHORITY!!!

Cartman hauls off and starts beating the crap out of both of
them. Kenny's mother and father YELL and SCREAM as they get
pummeled IN THE SHINS with Cartman's vengeful stick.

Kenny and his brother laughs hysterically.

Just then, a voice blasts over Cartman's radio.

RADIO
ALL UNITS! ALL UNITS!! WE HAVE A 5-
20 ON THE SUSPECT! REPORT TO THE
SOUTH PARK PETTING ZOO IMMEDIATELY!!

CARTMAN
(To himself)
Chickenlover...

EXT. SOUTH PARK PETTING ZOO

PAN along the animals, all of which are being petted by
children, who all look completely bored.

The Pan SETTLES on a chicken, which looks scared, and is
surrounded by Barbrady, Stan and Kyle who are all trying to
protect it.

BARBRADY
Keep your eyes peeled, boys.
Somebody's going to make love to
this chicken any minute...

The chicken's eyes grow wide.

STAN
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.

KYLE
Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.

BARBRADY
Oh, no...

But just then, a loud rustling is heard.

BARBRADY
Shh!

All is quiet... Barbrady and the boys look around carefully.
Behind them, a hand reaches out and grabs the chicken!!

CHICKEN
BA-GWAKK!!

-- But nobody notices.

BARBRADY
Keep your eyes peeled!

STAN
LOOK!!

Stan turns to the bush, where rustling is going on.

KYLE
HE'S HERE!!

BARBRADY
GRAB HIM!!

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

Cartman races down the street, with lights and sirens blaring.

CARTMAN
DAMMIT! Can't this thing go any
faster?!?!

Cartman bites into a donut.

EXT. SOUTH PARK PETTING ZOO

Barbrady emerges from the bushes with the chickenfucker in
hand. He is wearing an obvious Richard Nixon mask on his
face, and has a small gun in his hand.

The suspect spins around and pushes Barbrady away. He fires
his gun, but Barbrady dodges it, and the bullet hits Kenny.

STAN
Oh my God! They've killed --

But again, Kenny gets up. He looks at his hand which has
been shot, but appears fine.

STAN
God dammit!

Barbrady finally gets a hold of the suspect and subdues him.

BARBRADY
I knew it was you all along, Richard
Nixon!!

STAN
Uhh... I think that's a mask, dude.

BARBRADY
Oh.

Barbrady rips off the mask to reveal --

KYLE
Woa dude! It's the bookmobile driver!!

BARBRADY
Caught you red handed!!

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
Indeed you did!! How did you know I
would strike here?

BARBRADY
By reading Teetle the Timid
Taxidermist!

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
YOU DID?! REALLY?! THEN IT WORKED!!
MY WHOLE PLAN WORKED ABSOLUTELY
PERFECTLY!!!

STAN
What are you talking about dude?

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
When I heard that Officer Barbrady
couldn't read, I knew I had to
motivate him somehow! So I formulated
a plan to encourage him to learn the
magic of reading!!

KYLE
So you fucked a bunch of chickens?

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
YES! YES! EXACTLY!!! Don't you see,
only by fucking chickens could I get
Officer Barbrady to become literate!

Everyone thinks, and tries to make this make sense.

STAN
That doesn't make a whole lot of
sense dude.

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
Oh no? He who was blind can now see!
I got Officer Barbrady to read. My
plan worked perfectly!!!

Stan and Kyle look at each other, absolutely baffled.

BARBRADY
Well... I guess I should say thanks?

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
You're welcome. And now, my reading
friend, you've proven that you are
ready for the big time. I give you
this hardback copy of 'Atlas Shrugged'
by Ayn Rand.

The driver hands Barbrady the book.

Suddenly --

CARTMAN
FREEZE! Put your hands in the air!!

KYLE
Cartman!

They look over. Cartman is there holding up his mighty
nightstick.

CARTMAN
I got reports that the suspect is in
this area.

KYLE
Well, he is... It turns out that the
bookmobile driver here was the one
making love to chickens.

CARTMAN
Ah-HA!!

Cartman walks over and starts beating the bookmobile driver
in the shins relentlessly.

BOOKMOBILE DRIVER
AAGHAGH!! That hurts!!

KYLE
Woa, dude!

STAN
Cartman!

Barbrady rushes over and picks Cartman up.

BARBRADY
No, no! That's not how you uphold
the law!

CARTMAN
But he is not listening to my
AUTHORITY!!

BARBRADY
Oh, oh, you've got it all wrong my
little friend. You do it like this --

Barbrady whips around and starts beating the chickenfucker
in the head with his stick.

BARBRADY
You got to get them in the head,
they go down quicker.

The chickenfucker falls to the ground unconscious.

CARTMAN
Ohhh...

KYLE
I guess you should leave police work
to the professionals, huh Cartman?

BARBRADY
Well, anyway, I'm relieving you of
your duties. I've proved that I can
read and now I'm BACK ON THE JOB!!

STAN AND KYLE
Hooray!!

Barbrady starts to walk off.

STAN
Hey, so what are you going to do
now?

BARBRADY
(Stopping)
Now?

Barbrady holds up 'Atlas Shrugged'

BARBRADY
Well, I... I think I'll get in the
bathtub, and then curl up with a
good book!

Triumphant MUSIC plays as Barbrady gives a happy thumbs up.
FREEZE FRAME on Barbrady while the music plays for quite a
while.

Title: Executive Producer "Robert T. Pooner"

CUT BACK to the kids, who are all standing there, blinking
with confusion.

CUT BACK to Barbrady, who is still in a freeze frame, with
his thumb in the air, and music playing.

CUT BACK to the kids who look to one another, and finally
shrug and walk away.

ACT IV

ANGLE - TELEVISION NEWS

ANCHOR
And so today, South Park held a parade
to honor Officer Barbrady, and his
heroic work on the Chickenfucker
case.

EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

A parade is in progress for Barbrady. The crowd cheers him
on.

BARBRADY
Thank you everybody! Thank you!

TOWNSPERSON
Speech! Speech!

The crowd quiets in anticipation of a speech.

BARBRADY
What?

STAN
They want you to give a speech Officer
Barbrady, about the whole experience
over the last couple of days.

BARBRADY
Oh. Okay...
(to the crowd)
Well, first of all I'd like to thank
the town of South Park, the town
that borne me and eventually will
rob me of my life precious.

The crowd cheers.

BARBRADY
Second, I'd like to say to all those
out there who think they can screw
chickens just to teach people to
read... Your days are numbered!!!

The crowd goes wild.

BARBRADY
And finally, I'd like to say that
READING TOTALLY SUCKS ASS!!

KIDS
Hurray.

The crowd looks confused.

BARBRADY
Yes, at first, I was happy to be
learning how to read. It seemed
exciting and magical. But then I
read this --

Barbrady holds up a copy of ATLAS SHRUGGED, by Ayn Rand. All
1085 pages of it.

BARBRADY
Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read
every last word of this garbage and
because of this piece of SHIT, I'm
never reading again!

STAN AND KYLE
Hurrah for Barbrady!!!

The crowd goes wild again!!!

KYLE
Wow, I guess reading really does
suck ass.

CARTMAN
Hey, that's what I've been saying
all along, you guys.

STAN
I'm just glad everything turned out
okay and Barbrady got his job back.

KYLE
It's poetic justice.

Barbrady looks down with a smile.

BARBRADY
Thanks boys.

He gives them a thumbs up. FREEZE-FRAME and play survivor
music.

A big tree falls over on top of Kenny, killing him.

THE END

Episode 706


"LIL' CRIME STOPPERS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park neighborhood, day. The boys walk up to Butters' house.
Stan knocks on the door. The door opens and Butters' father looks
out]

CHRIS
Yes?  Oh, hello, boys.

CARTMAN
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives.
We're wondering if you have any crimes
to be solved, for a dollar.

CHRIS
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well,
I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I
need solved right now.

KYLE
Awww, shit!

STAN
All right, sir, well, please call us
if you need anything.

CHRIS
I'll do that. Have fun, boys.

CARTMAN
Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has
a crime to solve?

KYLE
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club
isn't such a bright idea.

STAN
It's a great idea, we just have to keep
working at it.

OLD WOMAN
Oh, hello there boys.

STAN
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with
the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have
any crimes you need to be solved, for
a dollar?

OLD WOMAN
Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well
let me thi-oh yes! There is something!


KYLE
Really?

OLD WOMAN
Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked
cherry pie out on my window sill to
cool.  And later, when I went to get
it, it was gone.

CARTMAN
My God...

STAN
Have you reported this to any other
authorities?

OLD WOMAN
Noo, but I think it's a perfect case
for you kids.

KYLE
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.


STAN
We're on the case.

[The old woman's house, backyard.]

CARTMAN
What have you got, Marsh?

STAN
Detective McCormick found something
interesting.

CARTMAN
Jesus, we're too late.

KYLE
I think we can piece this case together
now.

[The old woman's house, living room. She and her husband sit
back in arm chairs looking at news. The door opens and the boys
rush in with the pie tin]

OLD WOMAN
My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened
to the pie?

KYLE
Well, we've all talked it through and
we've come up with a theory.

OLD MAN
Well, what do you thnk happened, little
detectives?

STAN
You said you set the pie in the window
sill, where it must have sat for some
time.  But its sweet smell attracted
the attention of somebody.

KYLE
Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly,
but he knew that he was not allowed
to eat it yet.

CARTMAN
Slowly the rage built inside his mind.
"Why won't she let me eat that pie?
Why does she always stop me from doing
what I wanna do?!" His only solution
became obvious: Kill her!

STAN
His plan was to use a hammer.

CARTMAN
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing
instant death.

STAN
Then to make it impossible for police
to identify the body, he'd use a shovel
to remove your head.

KYLE
Then saw off the arms and legs.

CARTMAN
The torso he would dump into the lake.


STAN
The arms and legs he would dissolve
with acid and lye in the bathtub.


CARTMAN
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat
that pie.

KYLE
But before he could go through with
this entire plan, he discovered that
the pie had already been eaten...  ...by
your dog.

CARTMAN
Looks like the game is over, old man!


OLD WOMAN
Oh my God, what kind of television have
you kids been watching??

STAN
Just the news.

OLD WOMAN
All right, all right, you you boys run
along now.

STAN
Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.

OLD WOMAN
Fine, here, just go!

STAN
Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!


KYLE
We're in business!

[A basement, some time later. The dollar bill is newly framed
and hung on a wall in ... Cartman's basement, which is now the
South Park Detectives headquarters. Pictures of suspects are
on the wall below the framed dollar, a chalkboard has some instructions
listed, and some suspects already interviewed are listed on the
wall beneath the stairs. Kyle puts a file away in a filing cabinet
as the other boys do other tasks.]

CARTMAN
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp
in Washington

LIANE
Boys, you have a little visitor.

GIRL
Is this the South Park Crime Unit?


THE BOYS
Ah! Oh.

STAN
Yes it is!

GIRL
I lost my dollie.

CARTMAN
Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will
be all.  And get some more cookies and
coffee! We're not paying you to sit
on your ass!

KYLE
Do you kow where your doll is?

GIRL
If I knew where it was, it wouldn't
be lost.

STAN
All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now,
I want you to describe what the doll
looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.


SARAH
She has curly blonde hair. And a red
dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue
bow in her hair.

STAN
You got it, Ken?

KYLE
All right, let's see.  Damnit Kenny,
that's not what she said!

STAN
Put that away, dude!

CARTMAN
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your
doll.

[Sarah's house, day. The boys swarm into the girl's bedroom and
check out all the possibilities.]

CARTMAN
No sign of forced entry.

KYLE
But the window isn't locked.

STAN
Right, so it's possible that the theif
sat out in that tree.  He would have
watched Sarah with the doll, possibly
while cutting the palms of his hands
with a large knife.  The pain gave him
sick pleasure.

KYLE
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy.
He would have had to have brough a shovel
to decapitate it.

CARTMAN
We're going to need semen samples from
everything in this room.

A BOY
All right, let's do this by the books!
McDonnell,  give me smears of all the
places the doll used to be!  Mitchell,
run a tap on the phone!

STAN
Hey, kid, what are you doing?

THE BOY
Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?

STAN
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this
investigation!

TUCKER
...Not anymore, you're not!

CARTMAN
Hey, this is our case! You can't come
in and take over!

TUCKER
Can't we? You guys are playing Detective.
We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction
over you!

STAN
Aw crap!

TUCKER
I want choppers on the roof ready to
go!

KYLE
Dude, we've been working this case since
two-thirty!

TUCKER
Good. Then you can help us by telling
me everything you know.

[Sarah's house, afternoon, outside. The boys have been kicked
out by the FBI boys and head for the sidewalk]

STAN
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!

CARTMAN
Well, I guess we can go back to playing
laundromat.

STAN
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives!
We've just gotta find that doll before
thos FBI guys do.

KENNY
(Yeah!)

KYLE
Yeah, but how?

STAN
We're gonna have to just start bringing
in people for questioning.

CARTMAN
Right. I think I know exactly where
to start.

[Cartman's basement, later. The boys have called Butters in and
he's confused, being under the spotlight]

CARTMAN
Where were you this morning at nine
o'clock, Butters?!

BUTTERS
Ah, I was at home.

CARTMAN
Your story is full of holes and I'm
gonna beat your ass if you don't start
tellin' the truth!

KENNY
(Awww, don't be so hard. Maybe he's
tellin' the truth, huh?)

STAN
They've gotten really good at this
good cop-bad cop thing.

CARTMAN
You're going down, Butters! You hear
me?!

KENNY
(Aw. Now just be nice. Poor lil thing.)


CARTMAN
You're worth a two-dollar criminal and
you're lying!

KENNY
(Aw, please don't make him confess.)


BUTTERS
Well I don't have nothin' to confess.
Honestly.

CARTMAN
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us
a semen sample.

BUTTERS
How do I do that?

CARTMAN
You just make the semen come out of
your body and fill it in this cup!


BUTTERS
Well how do I make semen... come out
of my body?

CARTMAN
Stop playing games!

BUTTERS
I'm not playing. I really don't know!


CARTMAN
That does it! Wait right here!  Guys,
did you hear that? Butters doesn't know
how you make seme come out of your body.


KYLE
How... do you make semen come out?


CARTMAN
I don't know. I was hoping you guys
did.

STAN
It's that thing we learned about in
school where you pull on your weiner
until white stuff comes out.

CARTMAN
Really?

KYLE
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull
and mager...venate your weiner really
fast.

CARTMAN
Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't
know how to make semen come out?!


KYLE
No-o!

CARTMAN
Follow me to the bathroom.

KENNY
(Aw, it's okay kid. It's just done
in a jiffy)

[The Cartman hallway. Cartman takes Butters to the restroom]


CARTMAN
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and
tug on your weiner until white stuff
comes out, and then put it in this cup.


BUTTERS
My weiner??

CARTMAN
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your weiner.
Now do it!  Well Butters?!

BUTTERS
Ah I'm pullin' on my weiner, but nothin's
happening.

CARTMAN
Well pull harder!

BUTTERS
...ow... Ow... It's not workin'

CARTMAN
Try doin' it faster

BUTTERS
Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow.
Naw, nothin'

CARTMAN
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for
the rest of your life?!

BUTTERS
NOOooo!

CARTMAN
The you'd better get that semen sample
no matter how long it takes!

BUTTERS
Okay!!

STAN
Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip
that a doll was found near Fosse's house!


CARTMAN
Let's go!

BUTTERS
...ow... Ow!

[Fosse's house, a nice rambling house. Cartman approaches the
front door as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny stand off to one side. He
turns and places his back against the wall, then sneaks up to
a window. He looks in just a bit. Inside, a boy plays with a
doll... red dress, turned-up nose, blonde curly hair with two
blue bows attached... just as Sarah had described. Two boys giggle
as they play]

FOSSE
Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me
and Doctor... Flick here just need to...
check your vagina.

BILL
That's gay.

FOSSE
Yeah, that's gay.

CARTMAN
Kyle!

KYLE
What?  What??

CARTMAN
I see two guys inside. They have Sarah
Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!

KYLE
They've got the doll!

STAN
Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down!


FOSSE
Huh huh who is it?!

STAN
South Park Junior Detectives! We know
you have Sarah Peterson's doll!

FOSSE
They're playing Detective.

BILL
That's gay.

FOSSE
You're gay!

KYLE
What do we do now?

STAN
I don't know.

CARTMAN
Well if they're not gonna give us back
the doll, then we have no choice. Let's
go tell on them.

STAN
Dude, we just can't tell on them.

CARTMAN
Why not?

KYLE
Because, dude, we're playing detectives!
Detectives don't just go tell on people.


FOSSE
Detectives!  If you don't get out of
here, we're gonna rip the doll's head
off!

BILL
Yeah.

FOSSE
We were playing gynecologists and now
we're playing criminals

BILL
That's gay.

FOSSE
We're gay.

STAN
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!

KYLE
We've got to do something.

CARTMAN
Time! Time is what we need, but time
is something we ain't got!

TUCKER
Attention! You in the house!  This
is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have
you surrounded. Sort of.

STAN
Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!


CARTMAN
Yeah! This was our hot lead!

TUCKER
And you did a great job leading us here.
Now you just stay out of our way!  The
gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll!
Or we'll tell on you!

STAN
We're gonna charge the front door and
go get it.

TUCKER
No you're not.

CARTMAN
Damnit man, this is not the time for
negotiations! There's a little doll
in there about to have her head twisted
off!

TUCKER
Time out, kid! We say you can't charge
the front door, and you have to obey
what the FBI says! That's the rules!


STAN
Just because your parents can afford
better toys than ours doesn't make you
better than us!

TUCKER
Yes it does so!

KYLE
...Grrrr!!!

KENNY
(What do we do now?)

STAN
We go get the doll ourselves.

KYLE
But they said we can't charge the front
door.

STAN
That's right.  But they didn't say anything
about going in the back.

TUCKER
Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that
doll.

BILL
Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the
back!  That's gay.

STAN
Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!


FOSSE
No you didn't!

STAN
Did so!

FOSSE
No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor
on.

KYLE
We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons,
assface!

CARTMAN
All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm
going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!

FOSSE
Oooh, they got me!  Whooaaa, whooaaa,
whooaaa.

BILL
rr uh rr uh, uhhhh.

FOSSE
We're dead.

BILL
That's gay.

STAN
We got it.

[Sarah's house, later. Stan and the boys walk up to the house
again. Stan knocks on the door, and Sarah's mother answers]


STAN
Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?


SARAH
My dollie!

CARTMAN
We got her back safe. We lost a lot
of good men in the process.

SARAH'S MOM
Well you boys are little heroes. I'm
going to call the police department
and let them know what brave little
detectives you are!

[Park County Police Station, day. This building is much bigger
than the building Barbrady upholds the law from in South Park.]


DAWSON
Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm
Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County
Police. I heard you did a great job
finding Sarah Peterson's doll.

STAN
We do what we can, sir.

DAWSON
W-hell, that's fantastic, kids. And
for all your terrific sleuth-solving,
I'm hereby making you all Jenior Detectives.


KYLE
Wow!

DAWSON
That means you boys are now an official
part of the department.

CARTMAN
Kewl!

DAWSON
All right, so ready for your first assignment?


STAN
Sure.

DAWSON
Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567
Mala Vista. The operators are probably
armed to the hilt with illegal weapons.
I want you to get down there and see
what you can find!

KYLE
Ah... a a a meth lab?

DAWSON
I don't want any problems. Just take
them down by the books. Now get over
there; the mayor's all over my ass on
this one!  On, and deputies: you screw
this up and I'll have you working graveyard
shift behind a desk! Move it!

[Nighttime in the boondocks. The boys walk along a barren stretch
of road]

KYLE
What is a meth lab, anyway?

STAN
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I
wanna get home in time to watch Crime
Drama.

[The meth lab. Three men sit around a table as a forth man works
behind them. The juniro detectives approach the front door. Stan
knocks. The men inside quickly arm themselves]

STAN
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did
you guys do your math homework?

KYLE
Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.

MAN 1
You die, pigs!  You want to die, huh?


MAN 3
You won't take us alive!

MAN 5
So long, coppers!

STAN
Damn.

[Park County Police Dept., Dawson's office, later that night.
He reads the police report and paces behind his desk]

DAWSON
One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five
thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle
valued at sixteen thousand, the second
floor of the post office AND a coffee
shop valued at sixteen thousand! The
mayor's gonna have my ass!

STAN
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided
by the-

DAWSON
You got careless! Now, I don't know
how they do things down at that dog-and-pony
show they call the Fourth Grade, but
here we have rules! Jesus, we don't
have guys to question now, because you
killed them all!

KYLE
We're sorry.

DAWSON
One more slip-up like that and I'll
have your badges! You hear me?! Now
hit the showers!

[Park County Police Dept., locker room. Three men are changing
clothes, so they're all in their briefs. The boys enter.]

OFFICER 1
Well well well, if it isn't the supercops.


OFFICER 2
Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow
their G.I. Joes?

OFFICER 4
Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.


MURPHY
Relax, Hopkins!  All fun and games,
right?  Soho, tell us, rookies, you
ah... find yourself a little bonus in
that house??

CARTMAN
Uh bonus?

MURPHY
Come on! We all skim a little off the
top. Oh. Or are you too good for that?
So you think you're gonna waltz in
here and clean up the system. Is that
it?

STAN
We just wanna be junior detectives.


MURPHY
LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve
more than the thirty-thousand a year
we get paid! So what if we take in a
little on the side?

OFFICER 2
Yeah! Who the hell are you to say that?!


HOPKINS
I said, back off Murphy!

MURPHY
Why don't you and your rookie friends
make us

OFFICER 2
That's right. Come on, bring it!

OFFICER 3
Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!


DAWSON
What the hell is the problem here??


MURPHY
No problem, sir. No problem at all.


DAWSON
Then hit the showers, all of ya!

[The shower room, moments later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are
taking their showers. Kyle drops his soap to fart, then picks
it up again. Cartman works on his hair]

KYLE
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.


CARTMAN
Me neither.

STAN
It'll get better, guys.

KYLE
Better how, dude?

STAN
Look, we said we wanted to form a club
to protect and serve South Park. We
put all this time to it, I mean... What
do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to
playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat
Owners?

KYLE
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.


STAN
I wasn't. We started playing Detective
because we wanted our play time to mean
something. Or have you forgotten why
you joined the force, Kyle?

CARTMAN
Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!

STAN
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat
Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna
give those kids playing the FBI a chance
to laugh at us. See you guys at school
tomorrow.

[Cartman's house, night. His door opens, and a tired Cartman
walks in]

CARTMAN
Awwwwrrr-auugh.

LIANE
Eric, where have you been? It's ten
thirty.

CARTMAN
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala
Vista.

LIANE
Well you should've called Mommy.

CARTMAN
Will you get off my back?! It's hard
enough I gotta work the beat, and now
I gotta come home to your nagging?!
Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just
this case, and... the guys down at the
station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm
I'm tired.

LIANE
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums'
night-night, and I'll bring you some
toasty chocolate nummers?

CARTMAN
Okay.

BUTTERS
Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!

CARTMAN
Butters?

BUTTERS
Yes?

CARTMAN
Are you still trying to give a semen
sample?

BUTTERS
Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin'
out.

CARTMAN
Well, keep tryin', Butters.

BUTTERS
Okay.  Ow. Ooww!

[South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in class, sleeping.
As Butters was at home at 9 am the previous day, this day is
Monday]

MR. GARRISON
And so you can see, children, that the
women's movement of the late fifties
and the early sixties had a profound
effect on feminism in America.  Uh,
boys!  Would it trouble you terribly
not to sleep in my class?

KYLE
Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.


MR. GARRISON
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me
who was in charge of the feminist movement
of the early sixties!

CARTMAN
A bunch of fat old skanks on their
periods?

MR. GARRISON
Right, but who was the fattest oldest
skank on her period?!  That's what I
thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children,
now, the biggest fatass was an old skank
by the name of-

DAWSON
Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman!
In my office!

THE BOYS
Eeagh!

[Park County Police Department, later. The boys walk in sleepily.
Dawson holds a file in his right hand]

DAWSON
Looks like that meth lab you took down
was the tip of the iceberg. They found
a paper trail leading all the way to
the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.


CARTMAN
Un oh...

DAWSON
The operators apparently run their business
out of a sleazy strip joint down in
Inglewood. They're all cop killers,
so I'm sending you in undercover.


KYLE
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework
to do tonight and I was-

DAWSON
What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin'
you one last chance! You're good cops,
but you let your emotions get in the
way! And your little "shoot first ask
questions later" technique has no place
in this century! Now you get down to
that strip joint and you do it by the
books, you got it?! The mayor is on
my ass and blablablah!

MURPHY
So, what did you boys have to say to
the lieutenant?

STAN
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of
stuff.

MURPHY
Maybe you decided you needed to tell
him about our... bonus money.

KYLE
No.

OFFICER 2
They're lying.

MURPHY
They're dead!

[Inglewood, Colorado, night. A big city. The strip club shown
is The Peppermint Hippo. Inside there are several dancers undulating
for their patrons on individual stages. Other dancers dance on
the club floor for individual patrons. The boys enter the club]


KYLE
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here,
I would be in super big trouble.

KENNY
(Woohoo!!)

STRIPPER
Would you like a dance?

STAN
No thanks.

STRIPPER
Dance?  Anyone like a dance?

DJ
Well all right, guests, put your hands
together. Be sure to tip the dancers.
And now, come on, let's here it for
Candy!

BOUNCER
Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids
doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate
place for children

STRIPPER
Dance? Anyone like a dance?

KYLE
Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.

STRIPPER
Oh, really? Let's go see.

[The Peppermint Hippo back room. Nice opulent place.]

OWNER
All right, so we'll have to start havin'
the McCormicks make our meth again and-


BOUNCER
Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.


GINO
What? Ha-I don't know no kids.

BOUNCER
I didn't think so. All right, you kids-


GINO
Hey wait a minute. These kids might
be just what we need to get our drugs
past the security at DIA. How would
you like to join our family?

TALL GOON
Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids
before, man. These kids are 5-0!

GINO
What?

TALL GOON
These kids are cops, man!

CARTMAN
Bang bang bang...

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Bang bang bang...

KENNY
(Pakew! Pakew!)

CARTMAN
Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!",
it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!"

DAWSON
God damnit! Those junior detectives
and their heroicly reckless ways! Murphy!
Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there!

STRIPPER
Dance??? Anybody like a dance???

HOPKINS
Freeze! South Park detectives!  Great
job, boys. You found the meth boss!


GINO
Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the
hell are you doing? We had a deal.


HOPKINS
A deal?

MURPHY
That's right. We're partners in the
drug business. Everything was fine until
these "supercops" joined the force.


JENKINS
Now we've gotta kill you all.

HOPKINS
Boys! Down!

DJ
Huh alright guys, put your hands together,
a lot of shootin' and killin' goin'
on, but be sure to tip your waitress
let's hear it for Rebecca.

DAWSON
Christ! Those junior detectives have
no regard for the law!

LEAD FBI AGENT
Get me a hard line to the phone! And
I want choppers on the roof!

DAWSON
Who the hell are you??

LEAD FBI AGENT
Agent Fields, FBI!

DAWSON
Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.


FIELDS
Not anymore, you're not.

DAWSON
But that's not fair!

FIELDS
Is so! Is so!

JENKINS
Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let
anybody know about our partnership.


GINO
That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!


MURPHY
That's right.  I think we'll take a
hundred percent now.

JENKINS
Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business
like this, sometimes partnerships need
to end.

MURPHY
That's right.  Sometimes partnerships
need to end.  Well, supercops, looks
like I'll be taking in all the money
now. I'm in business alone. And that
means that the only person I can't trust...
is myself.

[Outside the Peppermint Club. The paramedics have arrived and
are removing the bodies. Hopkins, up and about, reaches the boys]


HOPKINS
It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got
what they deserved. If it weren't for
you boys, we would have never cleaned
up the department.

DAWSON
All right, detectives, let's get one
thing straight! I do not agree with
your methods! You're uncontrolled, and
you're negligent! But by God you get
the job done. Congratulations!

STAN
Thanks.

DAWSON
I'm probably going to regret this, but,
well, I'm promoting you to full detectives.
There'll be lots of action, and that
big paycheck you've always wanted.


STAN
...I think I have a better idea.

[Cartman's basement, next day. The boys are back at playing Laundromat.
The wall under the stairs has been removed to show the washer
and dryer, which are now framed by a doorway saying "Employees
Only." Two clothes racks are seen, and the detectives' desks
are refashioned as washer/dryer combos. A "Laundromat" sign on
the wall looks over the whole thing]

KYLE
Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski
Laundromat.

STAN
Yes, I have a suit that needs to be
dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.


KYLE
Certainly.

CARTMAN
Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your
laundry is all done and folded. That
will be nine ninety five.  On your American
Express.

BUTTERS
Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah
I got my semen sample!

CARTMAN
You did?

BUTTERS
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my weiner
for two days straight, aaand finally,
I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs,
and this little timy spooge of... this
white stuff came out.

KYLE
That's great, Butters, but we're not
playing Detective anymore. We're playing
laundromat owners.

CARTMAN
Would you like those pants cleaned for
four ninety five?

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 611


"CHILD ABDUCTION IS NOT FUNNY"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Tweek's house, night. He's on the sofa looking at news.]

NEWS ANCHOR
And in other news, another school shooting
has taken place, this time in Idaho.
As these kinds of shooting increase,
one thing becomes clear: Your children
are not safe at school.

TWEEK
Oh God!  Change it! Change it!

NEWS ANCHOR
This was the second time a terrorist
threat has been made on a theme park,
leaving everyone to realize that children
are not safe outside.

TWEEK
Agh! God, change it!!

NEWS ANCHOR
And it seems there's a new danger to
look out for: children who are taken
by strangers. The bottom line: children
are not safe... in their own homes!


TWEEK
Aaaah!!

TWEEK'S MOM
Tweek.

TWEEK
Gahahghah

TWEEK'S MOM
Come to the kitchen, sweetie. We need
to see you real quick.

[Kitchen. Richard is at table as Tweek arrives. Tweek's mom is
serving coffee. There are two coffee makers in the background]


TWEEK
Oh God. They're gonna get me.

RICHARD
Sit down and have some coffee, son.
Tweek, there's starting to be a lot
of reports in the news about kids being
abducted, and we thought we should talk.


TWEEK
I s-I saw! Uuuh!

TWEEK'S MOM
You know never to talk to strangers,
right Tweek? You can't trust anybody.


TWEEK
Oh God! Huh!

RICHARD
Now, we don't want to alarm you, son,
but we've isntalled new locks on your
bedroom windows and door. Important
for you to know never to unlock them
at night for anyone except your mother
and I.

TWEEK
Oh Jesus! Huh!

TWEEK'S MOM
It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably
nothing will ever happen.

[The Tweek house, after bedtime. Tweek is in his bed having a
nightmare.]

TWEEK
No, ...NO! They're gonna get me!  GAAAH!
Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God.  Uh, just
a dream.  OH MY GOD!!  GAAAH!!

VOICE
Tweek! This is Officer Daniels! Now,
try and stay calm, but we believe an
abductor is in your room!

TWEEK
...Inside my room? Oh God!

VOICE
Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded!
Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly
but quickly walk to the door and come
out to us!

TWEEK
Oh my God!  Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through
this.  AAAHH!

VOICE
Bang!  You're dead, Tweek.

TWEEK
What??

RICHARD
You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell
you not to open the door for anybody
except your mother and I?

TWEEK
Oh God! Oh Jesus!

TWEEK'S MOM
What if that had been a child abductor
pretending to be a police officer, Tweek?


RICHARD
He would have sprayed your brains all
over the floor and then taken your body
off to the woods.  You've got to be
on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go
to bed and get some rest.

TWEEK'S MOM
'Night, pumpkin.

[The Bijou, next day. "Men In Black II" is showing. Stan, Kyle,
Cartman and Tweek walk up to the ticket booth]

STAN
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.


KYLE
It will.

CARTMAN
One please.

TWEEK
Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker
guy!

KYLE
So?

TWEEK
So? I don't know him!

CARTMAN
Dude, relax.

TWEEK
You relax! What if he wants to kill
me?! AAAAAAAA!!

CARTMAN
Gah, what the hell do his parents do
to him?

[Down the road. Tweek is running, but soon tires out. A car pulls
up and the driver looks out the passenger window]

DRIVER
'Scuse me, is this the right road to
Breckenridge.

TWEEK
AAH! Uh...

DRIVER
Please, I just need to know if this
is "South Park"?

TWEEK
Get away from meee!

[A street corner. Tweek arrives there and stops to catch his
breath. An elderly lady walks up and taps his hair. Tweek screams
and jumps back. The crossing signal says "WALK," so it's alright
for both to cross the street]

ELDERLY LADY
Could you help me across the street?


TWEEK
I don't know you!  Ah, AAAH!

[The outskirts of town. Tweek is running and arrives at some
train tracks. A man in a wheelchair sits between the tracks.
He looks behind to see that no one has followed him]

MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Oh, hey, kid!  Oh, thank God you happened
by. My- my chair ran out of juice right
on these train tracks. If you hadn't
had shown up, well... Well, anyway,
could you give me a push?

TWEEK
Huh uh!

MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm
paralyzed from the neck down. I push
the chair with this device in front
of my mouth, but it's it's not working,
so you see-

TWEEK
I'm not supposed to talk to you!

MAN IN WHEELCHAIR
Please, this, this isn't funny, kid.
You have to help me.

TWEEK
But it could be a trick!  Ugh. That's
a pretty good trick.

[The Tweek house, night. Tweek is again asleep, peacefully. A
light fills the room and rouses him from his sleep. At the foot
of the bed is a man dressed in a robe. He holds a scepter in
his right hand and wears laurel branches on his head. He is glowing,
as is the bauble atop the scepter]

TWEEK
AaaaAAAHH!

MAN
Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt
you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness.


TWEEK
The Ghost of Human Kindness?

TWEEK
What do you want?

TWEEK
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems
that everywhere I turn, someone is out
to get me.

TWEEK
It isn't?

[A woman enters the Shady Acres Retirement Community and heads
for the front door. Tweek and the ghost arrive and follow her
in]

[A one-story house, later. Tweek and the ghost reach the front
window]

[The camera looks at a snowy sky with a full moon and pans down.
Tweek and the ghost are walking down the highway]

[South Park. Tweek and the ghost are back in town]

TWEEK
I think so. You mean that, even though
all the news is about murderers and
abductors, those kind of people... only
make up a very small part of the world.


TWEEK
I'll... try.

TWEEK
Your van?

OFFICER 1
Alright Johnson, give it up!

TWEEK
What the hell is going on??

TWEEK'S MOM
Tweek, Tweek, are you okay?

RICHARD
Did he hurt you, son?

TWEEK
No

DETECTIVE
Then we aren't too late. His name is
Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting
children by dressing up like the Ghost
of Human Kindness for over a year now.


LIANE
What's going on?

SHARON
A stranger was caught trying to abduct
the Tweek boy.

KYLE'S MOTHER
An abductor in our town?

TOM
Oh my God, what are we gonna do?

[South Park City Hall, next day. The townsfolk are clamoring
outside the front door]

TOWNSFOLK
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble
rabble rabble...

MAYOR MCDANIELS
People, people, calm down.

RANDY
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We
have to stop these abductors from being
able to get into our town!

TOWNSFOLK
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble
rabble rabble...

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble
rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.


JIMBO
Well we don't know what else to do,
Mayor!

TOWNSFOLK
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble
rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble.


MAYOR MCDANIELS
People, what do you think we need to
do?

KYLE'S FATHER
Uh, well, we need to find a way to
close our town off from unwanted strangers!


KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our
kids.

TOWNSFOLK
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...


RANDY
Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build
a huge city wall all around South Park
so that we have complete control over
who comes in.

RICHARD
That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.


KYLE'S MOTHER
But who can we get to build it?

[City Wok, later. Several adults are in the restaurant]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
...And so, we want you to design and
build a great wall, all around the city.


CITY WOK OWNER
I don' build wall. I just own un' operate
City Wok.

KYLE'S FATHER
We just think that you're the best person
to put up a wall. We're sure you've
got it in your blood.

CITY WOK OWNER
Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese,
you think I build wall. That i' bullshit!
I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because
I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around
building wall! I'm just a normal person
like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive
ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you!
I'm not stereotype!

SHARON
Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.

RANDY
Your ancestors put up a great wall that
kept Mongolians out for thousands of
years. We know you can do it for us.


[Outside South Park, some weeks later. A great wall has gone
up around South Park, enclosing it like a medieval wall. This
is the Great Wall of South Park. Tuong, dressed in his restaurant's
uniform, is laying down some bricks. He hears some horses and
look up. Some Mongolians have arrived and drawn their swords.
They chip away at the wall.]

TUONG
Hey. Hey hey!  Hey, what the hell you
doing?!  Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians
doing here?  Ey, fuck you, Mongorians!
Tryin' break down my wall!  Get out
of here, fuckin' Mongorians!  God-damnit,
how come every time us Chinese put up
a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come
and knock it down?

[South Park, now encircled by the Great Wall, later.]

[The Marsh house, living room. Stan is on the sofa watching TV.
His parents enter. Randy is carrying a box]

RANDY
Stan, our abduction problems are over.
We got the new Child Tracker.

STAN
Child Tracker?

SHARON
It's a little electrical device that
can tell us where you are anywhere on
Earth.

RANDY
If anybody takes you, we'll be able
to locate your exact location within
two meters.

[Moments later, Randy finishes installing the Tracker, and both
parents smile.]

RANDY
There, I think that's got it.

STAN
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child
Tracker!

RANDY
You can barely even tell you have one
on.

STAN
I'm not going to school like this! What
will all the other guys say?!

SHARON
I wouldn't worry about that.

[School bus stop, next day. Stan is wearing his tracker. Kyle,
Cartman, and Tweek are wearing their own trackers. All trackers
are activated.]

CARTMAN
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.

KYLE
Why did you go and have to be abducted,
Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking
out!

TWEEK
I didn't mean to.

[The Great Wall of South Park. Tuong finishes the repairs on
the damaged section.]

TUONG
Okay. Finary.  Oh no.  It's those God-damned
Mongorians again! Stop! Stop right there,
Mongorians!  God-damnit, stop!  Stop
breaking down my city wall you stupid
Mongoriaaans!  Ay, you sons of bitches,
you-  What the hell??  Oh, shit!  OH,
GOD-DAMNED MONGORIANS!!  I'm gonna get
you, fuckin' Mongorians! Don't break
down my city wall!  Oh, God-damnit!
That's the last time you're gonna break
down my city wall! You hear me, Mongorians?!
God-damned Mongorians.

[A baseball field. A cheer comes up from the bleachers. A close-up
shows the townsfolk rooting for their Cows.]

RICHARD
Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there
and we're gonna give 'em hell!

KYLE
But, wait. Where's the other team?


RANDY
There is no other team.

STAN
Huh?

RICHARD
Well, we've... put a wall around the
city to keep outsiders out. You don't
think we want a bunch of strangers coming
in to play ball, do you?

STAN
But if there is no other team, then
it won't be any fun.

RANDY
Don't worry, it'll still be fun for
us.

TOWNSFOLK
Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!


JIMBO
Play ball!  Steeeeee-riiike

TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah!

[Crust E. Krotch's Pizza, Corral, night. The town is in there
celebrating a victory. Ned is playing "Thirst For Blood"]

JIMBO
South Park Cows do it again!

SHARON
Congratulations on your victory, boys.


KYLE
Dude, we weren't playing anybody.

RANDY
Yeah, and you kicked ass!

MR. GOODMAN
Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall
around our city? Nobody in town except
for our good friends.

TOWNSFOLK
Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right
on!

RICHARD
Guys! Sh, quiet everyone.

NEWS ANCHOR
And this newest study reveals more
about child abductions than we apparently
knew before, Tom.

SHARON
Turn it up.

TOM
That's right, Chris. This newest study
shows that the majority of child abductions
are NOT commited by strangers, but by
somebody the child knows in their own
town.  The report further states that
it is because the child trusts the individual
that problems occur in the first place.


CHRIS
Well, I guess this means the enemy is
in our own backyard, so to speak.


TOM
Sure does, Tom.

CHRIS
Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather
going to turn su-

RICHARD
Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think
we'll be going now.

KYLE'S FATHER
Yeah. Come along, Kyle

SHARON
Stanley, time for us to get back to
the house.

STAN
I'm not done with my pizza.

SHARON
NOW, Stanley!

[The Great Wall of South Park. Tuong is working on something
behind a brick shield.]

TUONG
Eh. Eh, eh, there we go.  All finished.
My Mongolian Missile Defense system.
Those Mongolians try to break down
my city wall again, they gonna get a
big heat-seeking missile surprise!
Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come
to break down my city wall?  Oh, you
gonna throw that baseball at my wall??
Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared.
Well, you know what? I might have something
here that's a little bigger than a baseball.
Say hello to my little friend!  Aw,
crap.  Ooohhhh  God-damned Mongolians!!
You break down my city wall foda last
time!!

[South Park, the bus stop, next day. The parents are present
with the boys as they wait for the school bus]

STAN
Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.


RICHARD
'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't
here.

SHARON
Right. Do what you normally would do.


KYLE
You're such a fatass, Cartman.

CARTMAN
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Whatwhatwhaaat??

[South Park Elementary. The bell rings and the class begins.
Mr. Mackey is at the board. ]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me
what year the first moon landing took
place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde?


MR. GOODMAN
Nineteen six-

COUNSELOR MACKEY
No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure
havin' all the parents here is a good
idea, m'kay?

RICHARD
Well, maybe things could be better if
we could trust people like the Stotches!


CHRIS
Us?? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed
ones!

RICHARD
Oh yeah?!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom,
Dad, could you please leave me alone?


MR. MACKEY'S FATHER
We just wanna make sure nobody hurts
you, Junior, m'kay?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay.

[Great Wall of South Park. Mr. Lu Kim wheels a vat of boiling
fluid to one of the openings]

TUONG
Hahahaha! My masterpiece!  When those
Mongolians come next time, I pour this
sweet and sour pork on their heads.
Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and
sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright
up to the wall! And scream "UhwOoOoOoOoo!"
Oh I can't wait.  Oh, I get it. A Trojan
Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding
inside thinking that I'll bring it in
city wall, then Mongolians pop out and
destroy wall from the inside out without
gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their
heads! Okay. I'll pray around.  Oh!
Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian
Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise!
I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy,
smelly people after all!  Yeah. Great!
Rwow!  Yeah, what a great present! I'm
just gonna push it inside the gate and
soon tell all my friends.  Oh, it's
sweet and sour pork!  Oh! I'm going
to get you Nogodians, if it's the last
thing I do!

[The Tweek house, night. The parents are in the living room sitting
together on the sofa watching TV and sharing a bag of popcorn.
A blanket covers their legs. The surroundings show an iron door
where the front door is, and roll-down iron blinds over the windows]


NEWS ANCHOR
And so all the residents of Manhattan
are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's
ass gets any bigger. And in other news,
new findings on the increase in child
abductions.

RICHARD
Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!

NEWS ANCHOR
The study shows that the most likely
abductors of children... are the parents
themselves!  The study reveals that
nine out of every ten abduction cases
are commited by the child's mother or
father. The bottom line being that your
children aren't safe, even from you!


RICHARD
Where are you going?

MRS. TWEEK
Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and
see if Tweek is still in his bed.


RICHARD
Oh??  I think I'll go with you.

MRS. TWEEK
It's okay. I can do it.

RICHARD
I just want to make sure that you-


MRS. TWEEK
That I don't abduct him? How do I know
that you haven't done it already??


RICHARD
Me?? I would never abduct our son!


MRS. TWEEK
That's not what the new study says!


RICHARD
Well what are we supposed to do, eh-?
How can we protect Tweek from ourselves?


[South Park, next day. The familes gather on a neighborhood street.
The parents are hugging their kids.]

RANDY
Here you go, Stanley. This should hold
you over for three years.

STAN
But why do I have to leave?

RANDY
The news says that at your age you aren't
safe with us, son. You have to get out
of here before we abduct you.

SHARON
Good-bye, son.  Remember to eat right.


KYLE'S FATHER
Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're
the man now.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we
love you!

LINDA STOTCH
Be careful out there!

STAN
Where are we supposed to go?

RANDY
We can't tell you because we can't know
where you are!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh, this is terrible!

MR. GOODMAN
Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back!


RANDY
Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget
you.

STAN
Dude, sometimes I think our parents
are really stupid.

A WOMAN
Oh my God.

[The Great Wall of South Park, day. Tuong is still congealed
under the sweet and sour sauce the Mongolians dumped on him,
but the Trojan Mongolian horse is gone. A dog walks by and sniffs]


TUONG
Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog.
Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya.  Good
dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog!


[Some time later. Tuong runs along the ramparts of the wall,
finally freed from the sweet and sour pork that had held him
in place]

TUONG
Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians!
And now I'm gonna make you PAY!

[The Marsh house, night. Randy is at the sofa watching the news.]


NEWS ANCHOR
Finally, some good news tonight. It's
been several days since any child abductions
have taken place. The main reason: parents
don't know where their children are.


RANDY
What's the matter?

SHARON
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if
Stan's okay.

RANDY
Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere
safe by now.

SHARON
Do you really think we did the right
thing, Randy? Sending all the young
kids in town to live on their own?


RANDY
Sweetheart, you saw the news...

SHARON
I know.

RANDY
Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan
and all the other kids are somewhere
safe, off in a whole new city by now,
making a new life for themselves.


[A Mongolian camp outside the Great Wall of South Park, night.
The Mongolians are roasting and enjoying small animals, and drying
the hides near a tent. The town's kids are now with them, wearing
new clothes.]

LEADER
Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.


STAN
Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai.

MONGOLIAN
De bandig baeakhalah?

CARTMAN
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.

TWEEK
Triben fak burushban.

ALL
Shain balag!

[The Great Wall of South Park, day. Tuong pops up outside the
wall dressed in imperial attire.]

TUONG
Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through
this wall is through me. This is my
rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance
now.  Does my war dance ascare you,
Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want
a piece of this?  This is ancient Chinese
dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful,
there's a-Mongolians up there.  Oh,
crap!

RANDY
What's going on?

LIANE
I heard an explosion.

TUONG
God-damned Mongolians attacked city
wall again!

MAN IN BACK
Mongolians??

RANDY
What the hell are they doin' here?!
Rabble! Rabble rabble!

ADULTS
Rabble rabble rabble rabble!

RICHARD
Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are...
our children.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Ike?? Kyle??

SHARON
My son has become a Mongolian?? No!
Noooo!!

RICHARD
Oh God. What have we done? We sent our
children away, and now they don't even
remember who they are.

MR. GOODMAN
Kids? Don't you remember us?

RANDY
Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian
in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids,
uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah
tasobarro.

STAN
Oh my God, our parents are so stupid,
dude.

RANDY
Bi kute.

MR. GOODMAN
We are your parents. You used to live
here, with us.

KYLE
Yeah, it was like four days ago!

RICHARD
They're starting to remember.

RANDY
Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!

STAN
Uh huh, Stan Marsh.

RANDY
That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber!


RICHARD
We're sorry, Tweek!

MR. GOODMAN
Are you okay, Clyde?

CHRIS
Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?


BUTTERS
Huh, I'm over here, Dad.

CHRIS
Oh.

KYLE'S MOTHER
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those
sensationalist news reports go to our
heads.

RICHARD
Oh my God, do you see what this means?
The Ghost of Human Kindness was right
all along.

MR. GOODMAN
You mean how he said we should trust
each other, or how he abducted children?


RICHARD
The uh... no no, the part about being
more trusting. We should follow what
he said, not what he did.

ADULTS
Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.

RANDY
No, no. You know who was right all along?
The Mongolians.  They knew that you
just can't wall yourself off from the
outside world. Putting walls up never
helps anything. Tearing them down brings
us together.

ADULTS
Whoa! Wow. Right!

CHRIS
Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.


TUONG
Aw, you'd better not say what I think
you're gonna say.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!

TUONG
Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty!


SHARON
Randy, can we just take our son home
now?

RANDY
Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home.
Hoomme.

STAN
Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some
stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ.

"CARTMANLAND"


Written by


Trey Parker





[A bright, sunny day, with some clouds in the sky. The camera
pans down to a funeral scene in a cemetery with robust trees]


PRIEST
...And so it is with heavy hearts that
we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman.
She was a good woman, a community leader,
a caring wife, a providing mother ,
and a loving grandmother .

CARTMAN
Mom, it's 3:30! This is taking up my
whole Saturday!

LIANE
Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.


CARTMAN
Why couldn't the funeral have been on
a school day?

PRIEST
And now, let us bow our heads in a moment
of silence and reflect on how Mabel
touched our lives.

CARTMAN
God! She didn't take this long to die!


PRIEST
And now we release the doves to symbolize
the Lord taking Mabel into his arms
and giving her everlasting peace.


ASSISTANT
Peace.

CARTMAN
Great! Now can we go?!

LIANE
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some
of Grandma's business.

CARTMAN
Ogh! God-damnit!!

JOHNSON'S & ASSOCIATES

LAW FIRM

[The city, day]

EXECUTOR
...And so I leave my stocks and bonds,
worth an estimate fourteen dollars and
twelve cents, to be divided amongst
my loving family.

CARTMAN
Mom, I wanna go home!

LIANE
In a minute, sweetie. This is important.


EXECUTOR
To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you
the house in Nebraska. Look after it
as your father and I did.

CARTMAN
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh!

EXECUTOR
To my grandson Eric: You are always
my favorite fat little man, my perfect
round little pudding-piler.

CARTMAN
Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me
even in death, Grandma?!

EXECUTOR
For you, Eric, I leave from my life
savings, the sum of one million dollars,
to be transferred to you immediately.


CARTMAN
Hoosajiggawha?

LIANE
A million dollars?

EXECUTOR
Eric is the primary benefactor of my
estate, since it is likely the rest
of you would spend the money on crack.


LIANE
Oh my.

UNCLE STINKY
That can't be!

CARTMAN
Uh yah sir, excuse me: Du- Does this
mean that I... have... one... million
dollars?

EXECUTOR
Yes, Eric, it's yours.

CARTMAN
Nonowait, you don't understand:  since
I was th-three years old it has been
my dream to have one million dollars


EXECUTOR
And now, you do.

CARTMAN
Egh.

[South Park, day. A car with a woman seated in it appears on
a hill]

STAN
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"  "You've
been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."


KYLE
"No, please! I promise I'll never make
another album or movie!"

STAN
"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."


KYLE
"Have mercy!"  Yeah ha ha!

STAN
Yeah, awesome!  ...Why?

KYLE
Nuh uh.

STAN
You'd better not be lying, Kenny.


[South Park, the Bank, later. Inside, a banker counts the money
out in $100 bills. Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Chef, and
others are there.]

BANKER
Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four
hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand
five hundred...

JIMBO
Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much
cash.

NED
Mm-me neither.

BANKER
...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand
nine hundred, one million.

CARTMAN
Look at it. Look at it, mother. See
how the light reflects the spearmint
green from its surface.

MR. GARRISON
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't
you think you should keep it in the
bank instead of at your hosue?

CARTMAN
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm
spending it.

JIMBO
On what?

CARTMAN
On my dream.  On the one thing that
I've wanted ever since I could remember...


[South Park, the Bank, outside. Cartman leads the others out
of the bank and down the street. The money is in hsi Radio Flyer
wagon]

BROKER
Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker;
I can help you invest that money.


CARTMAN
Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.

PRIEST MAXI
Eric, God could sure use that money
for a bigger church.

CARTMAN
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.


KYLE
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!


CARTMAN
Not much, just taking my  one million
dollars out of the bank.

STAN
Oh my God.

KYLE
Kenny wasn't lying.

CARTMAN
Would you mind stepping aside? I have
a purchase to make.

STAN
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for
a new jacket?

CARTMAN
HA! If you need money, you can get a
JOB, Stan! No freeloadeers are gonna
take my hard-earned cash!

KYLE
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't
earn it!

CARTMAN
Didn't earn it?! What about all the
years I spent making Grandma like me?!
All the wet spit-filled kisses I put
up with?! The constant smell of aspirin
and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn
it, you son of a bitch!

KYLE
No... No, this isn't possible.

STAN
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

KYLE
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan!
Cartman is the biggest asshole in the
world! How is it that God gives him
a million dollars?

STAN
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is
doing with his money.

KYLE
Why? How could you do this? There are
people starving in Alabama and... and
you give Cartman a million dollars?


[North Park Funland, day. Cartman and his mom are in the park
office signing papers]

BROKER
...Aaand if we can just get you to sign
here...  and here... .

LIANE
Are you sure this is what you want,
sweetie?

CARTMAN
My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.


BROKER
And now you just sign here, Mr. Foon.


MR. FOON
I can't do it.

BROKER
What?

CARTMAN
What?!

MR. FOON
Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my
park.  Look, I haven't been honest with
you. The park hasn't been doing great
business.

BROKER
Frank...

MR. FOON
Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris.  The
truth is, the park is a financial flop.
I haven't turned a profit in years because
I can't keep attendance up.

CARTMAN
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get
people to come.

MR. FOON
You... you're not?

CARTMAN
No no no! I'm buying it to keep people
out!  Don't you see? Forever it has
been my dream to have my very own theme
park, so that I could be alone in it,
all day, every day. I love theme parks.
But the lines! Everywhere you go, people,
crowds,  The rides are great, but...
All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's
one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines,
lines, LINES!!  And then there get to
be so many people  that they make FastPass.
So then there's lines for FastPass.
You stand in line to get a ticket to
stand in line later. Then there's lines
for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks
, lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas
Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park
is for me. Nobody else will be allowed
in it.

MR. FOON
Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel
bad.

CHRIS
Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme
park is yours.

CARTMAN
Gentlemen, I thank you.

[South Park Synangogue, night. A main door opens and Stan enters]


STAN
Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here?
Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?


KYLE
Do you know what happened to me this
morning, Stan? This morning... I woke
up and felt a sharp pain in my ass.
I felt down there and, and found this...
big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't
even sit down, so... I, I had to tell
my mother, which, which was humiliating.
She took me to the doctor, which was
more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me.
I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an
infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm
nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid,
Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman
has his own theme park.

STAN
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean,
but-

KYLE
Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all
my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah!
To believe that we should all behave
a certain way and good things will come
tu us. I make mistakes, but every week
I try to better myself. I'm always saying,
"You know, I learned something today..."
and what does this so-called God give
me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't
make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow.


STAN
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna
be happy because he has his own amusement
park, but, he's gonna find out that
without other people, the rides are
totally lame. I mean, who could really
have fun by themselves at a theme park?
I'll bet he's sick of it already.


[North Park Funland, day. Cartman is on the Carousel on a white
horse, alone]

CARTMAN
Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!
Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your
arms and legs inside the vehicle at
all times, make sure your seatbelts
are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how
much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah!
Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure
Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo!
Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy!
I'm so happy!

[Stan's house. Kyle enters carrying a padded seat ring]

STAN
Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is
just about to start.

KYLE
Great.

STAN
What that?

KYLE
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on
it because of my hemorrhoid.  Ow.


STAN
Heh, heh.  Sorry.

KYLE
So, how are things going at Cartman's
theme park?!

STAN
Dude, just forget about it. We can't
let him get to us, or he wins.

KYLE
Hunh, I guess you're right.

CARTMAN
Hey, everybody! Check out the all new
Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening!
Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous
rides , six roller coasters , and tons
of great surprises!  And the best part
is:  You can't come!!  That's right,
because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric
Cartman, can get in! That means only
I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister
, a roller coaster that splashes in
the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement
park in the Colorado area! And nobody
can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!!
HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland
now!  But don't plan on getting past
the parking lot,  'cause remember:
So much to do at Cartmanland, but you
can't come!  Especially you, Stan and
Kyle.

STAN
That does it, dude!

KYLE
Where are we going?

STAN
We're getting into that fatass's park
whether he likes it or not!

[Cartmanland, Haunted Mansion, night. Cartman is back on the
ride.]

CARTMAN
Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.
Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one
part, with the-uum, with the spider
that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally
got me. That was sweet! Heheh.

KYLE
Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help!
Ow, that hurts!

CARTMAN
What the hell?

KYLE
Hohohooho! Oowwww!

CARTMAN
You sons of bitches!

[Cartmanland, perimeter fence. Stan is in the park waiting for
Kyle to come down, but Kyle is stranded on top of the fence.
The view is from the park towards the parking lot.]

STAN
Come on, dude!

KYLE
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!


CARTMAN
What the hell are you doing?!

STAN
Aw, crap.

KYLE
Oho God, get me off of here!!

STAN
Dude!

KYLE
Stahan, I have to go home!! I need
my cream!! I need my creeheam!!

STAN
Alright, let's go.

CARTMAN
That's right! You stay out!

STAN
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking
fastass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's
hemorrhoid is better!

KYLE
My life can't get any worse!

STAN
You'll see! We'll get in!

CARTMAN
...Alright, so listen: All I want you
to do is keep anybody out who tries
to get in here. If you see anybody on
my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle,
you are to shoot on sight!

SECURITY GUARD
So what does does this job pay?

CARTMAN
Alright, now this is very hard for me
to do, you understand. But, in return
for you working security, I'll let you
ride two rides a day. But only two rides,
and only if I'm not on them.

SECURITY GUARD
Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.


CARTMAN
But, you can ride anything you want.
And you don't have to wait in line.


SECURITY GUARD
I'm not interested.

CARTMAN
Dude, are you from Mars or something?
Any ride you want. No lines.

SECURITY GUARD
If you need security, I need a cash
salary.

CARTMAN
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything
on this park.

SECURITY GUARD
Well, look: Why don't you just let a
couple of people in each day? Every
day you can just let two people in,
charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you
can use that to pay my daily salary.


CARTMAN
Ugh. Two people?

SECURITY GUARD
This place is huge. You'll never notice
two people. And then you'll have security
for your park.

CARTMAN
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open
the park to two people each day! But
remember: anybody else you see trespassing
the park...

SECURITY GUARD
I will shoot on sight.

CARTMAN
Sweet.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Kyle is on a gurney face down. A
doctor stands behind him as his parents look on]

DOCTOR
You're a very lucky little boy. I've
never seen a hemorrhoid so infected.
It could have killed you.

KYLE
Sucky.

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan
is here to see you.

STAN
Dude, are you okay?

KYLE
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid
trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland,
and it got infected. I really need to
go to the bathroom, but if I do, it
will pop again and the pain will make
me pass out. How are you?

STAN
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman
is letting a few people each day into
his theme park. I wa thinking we could
put on disguises and get in.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride
any amusement park rides for over a
year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.


STAN
Jesus.

KYLE
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally
figured it out. You see, if someone
like Cartman can get a million dollars
and his own theme park, then there is
no God. There's no God, dude.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, don't say such things!

KYLE
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something
bad will happen to me? Because if I
do your God might not shower me with
his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?


KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle, youyouyou just don't understand.
It's-

KYLE
No! I finally do understand! There is
no justice! There is no God!. Do you
hear me?! I renounce my faith!!

[Cartmanland, day. Barbed wire has been placed atop every fence
imaginable. A crowd of people shows up. Among the people are
Butters, Clyde, Jordan, Bebe...]

CARTMAN
Alrightalright, listen up, people.
Cartmanland is open, but only to two
people each day.

KIDS
Aw.

BOY
That's gay.

CARTMAN
I just gotta cover my security expenses.
Butters, Clyde, you can come in.

BUTTERS
Hoh.

CLYDE
Oh.

CARTMAN
The rest of you will just have to try
another day.

KIDS
Aw.

CARTMAN
'K, one park admission? That will be
twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five
cents is your change and enjoy your
stay at Cartmanland.

BUTTERS
Hoh boy, oh boy!

CARTMAN
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can
get back to riding my rides.  Dada da,
I've got my own theme park. Hm, what
should I go on now? I know! I'll go
on the Haunted Mansion ride again!
Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa
da-ah-  What are you doing?

BUTTERS
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook
house.

CARTMAN
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you
go on something else right now?

BUTTERS
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh
well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five;
we should be able to go in the spook
house.

CLYDE
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The
cars aren't moving.

CARTMAN
Ugh, alrightalright, hang on.  Security!


SECURITY GUARD
What?

CARTMAN
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house
ride broke down. I need you to fix it.


SECURITY GUARD
Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.


CARTMAN
But I don't know how it works.

SECURITY GUARD
Well your rides are gonna break down
every now and then. You need to hire
a maintenance person.

CARTMAN
Ogh, alrightalright! I'll let two more
people in each day so I can hire a maintenance
person.

[Cartmanland, another day. A crowd of people shows up. Among
the people are Bebe, Token, Timmy, Kenny, Filmore...]

CARTMAN
Alright folks, we've had another change
in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance
person, and to pay his salary I have
to let in two more people a day.  However,
the stupid maintenance worker demanded
I have food and drinks inside the park,
so now I've had to hire a beverage person,
and a cotton-candy person, which means
I now have to let eight people come
in a day! BUT, you are to try your best
not to ride any rides that I am on!
Understood?  Alright, let's go.

TIMMY
Timmay!

CARTMAN
Wait a minute! Who are you?

BOY
Mike Gainor.

CARTMAN
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!


STAN
Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!

CARTMAN
I thought you said buying a theme park
was stupid! SECURITY!

STAN
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle
lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!


CARTMAN
Get him out of here!

SECURITY GUARD
Move along, sir.

STAN
AAAH!  This isn't over, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back
to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man,
I'm so scared!  AAAAaaaa....

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. A nurse works on Kyle's hemorrhoid
with pincers]

KYLE
Ah!  Aaah!

NURSE
Just a little more  There we go.

KYLE'S FATHER
Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?


KYLE
Awesome.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the book
of Job. It's a story from the Bible.


KYLE
I've had enough of the Bible. What has
it gotten me?

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, I think you'll see differently after
hearing this. Sit down, Kyle.  Uh, okay.
You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan
a long long time ago.  Job was a great
man. He was blessed with ten lovely
children , a wonderful wife, and many
friends.

KYLE'S MOTHER
He was godly, and a good man, and fed
the poor.

KYLE'S FATHER
He was the most upright and honorable
of men, and every day he praised God.


KYLE'S MOTHER
But one day, Satan went up to heaven
and talked to God.

KYLE
Satan talked to God?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Yes, in the book of Job, Satan talks
to God. And God says to Satan, "Have
you seen Job? He is a great man, and
he praises me every day."

KYLE'S FATHER
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises
you because you gave him so much. If
you didn't give him those things, he
would curse your name."

KYLE'S MOTHER
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show
you, Satan! I'll take those things away
from Job and he will still praise my
name."

KYLE'S FATHER
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians
come in and slaughter Job's oxen and
donkeys, and murder all his workers.


KYLE'S MOTHER
Then God sent his fireballs from the
sky and killed his sheep and the rest
of his employees.

KYLE'S FATHER
And then, as Job's sons and daughters
were eating, God sent a mighty wind
to collapse the house and crush and
kill them all.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to
his knees and said, "The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away," and praised
God's name.

KYLE'S FATHER
So then, Job got painful sores all over
his body.

KYLE'S MOTHER
He was in terrible, miserable pain all
day, every day. But he still kept his
faith.

KYLE'S FATHER
God said to Sata, "See? I told you.
Job still praises me."

KYLE
And that's it? That's the end?

KYLE'S MOTHER
Basically.

KYLE
That's the most horrible story I've
ever heard. Why would God do such a
horrible thing to a good person just
to prove a point to Satan?

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.

KYLE
Then I was right. Job has all his children
killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep
making movies. There isn't a God.


[Cartmanland, day. Yet another crowd of people awaits to get
in. Cartman greets them]

CARTMAN
...And, since the stupid security guard
needs video surveillance, I have to
let in two more people a day to cover
those expenses... Need to cover the
new ticket guy's salary, so that's three
more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew
for the bathroom, money to cover paint
and upkeep - so that's about four admissions
- that brings the grand total to...
God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen
people can come into the park today!


CLERK
Welcome to Cartmanland.

[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has been in to see Kyle's
recovery progress and is now talking to the parents]

KYLE'S MOTHER
Isn't he getting any better, doctor?


DOCTOR
I don't understand it. He's not fighting
the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's
like he... like he's lost all hope.
Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more
tests to run.

ANNOUNCER
And now back to Money Quest, on HBC.


HOST 1
Welcome back to Money Quest.  In just
over two weeks, young financial genius
Eric Cartman  has managed to turn a
theme park that was seeing less than
a hundred attendees a day into a thriving
park with attendance in the thousands.


HOST 2
And the way he did it is with the brilliant
"You Can't Come" technique. For the
first several days, the young businessman
saturated the market with the claim
that nobody could get into his park.
It made the public crazy. So then, weeks
later, when he opened the doors, they
were lining up around the block. Simply
amazing.

HOST 1
Well, ahah I thnk we should point out
that this technique is already being
applied by businesses all over the country.


[At a restaurant where all the tables are empty and everyone
is waiting in line...]

WAITRESS
I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations.
Nobody can eat here. You'll have to
leave now.

[At the Bijou, where everyone is waiting outside....]

CLERK
No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie.
Nobody can see this movie. I can't even
go in.

[At Gracy's clothing store, a sales associates barks orders...]


ASSOCIATE
Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's
anymore! Get out of here!

[Back to Money Quest...]

HOST 1
Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the
financial genius of our time.

[Back to Kyle's room at Hell's Pass Hospital...]

KYLE
Oh. Oohh.Ohuhughughhh.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle? Kyle?  Get the doctor!

[Cartmanland, day. Every ride has people on it, and every ride
Cartman is on shows a dejected Cartman as the others enjoy themselves.
At the Carousel he rides his favorite white horse, but shows
no joy in riding it. At Java Jam!!! he's in a purple teacup with
three other kids, and is not enjoying it. At Bumbper Buggies
he's in the #7 bumper car]

CARTMAN
Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me!


KENNY
(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!)

CARTMAN
AGH!  DAAAAAAH!!

[Cartmanland, Main Street. The crowds bustle about and business
is good. Chris the Broker and Mr. Foon are seen walking down
Main Street.]

MR. FOON
My God, look at it, Chris! That kid
completely turned this place around!


CHRIS
He sure did!

MR. FOON
Oh, if I could only have a park that
worked like this!

CARTMAN
Hey, there you are!

MR. FOON
Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.


CARTMAN
Just give me my money back.

MR. FOON
What?

CARTMAN
I changed my mind! I don't want your
stupid park!

MR. FOON
...But it's doing great!

CARTMAN
You call this great?! I call it Hell!
Trade me back, Goddamnit!

MR. FOON
You bet! I'll go get your money right
now!

BOY
Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?


CARTMAN
GODDAMNIT GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has brought Kyle's vitals
back, and Kyle is on oxygen, but he's still unconscious. Gerald
and Sheila look on]

KYLE'S FATHER
Isn't he responding at all, doctor?


DOCTOR
I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing
the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid
has spread to his lungs. Normally, the
body would fight the infection, but
he's... he's just... given up on life.


KYLE'S MOTHER
But then... are you saying...?

DOCTOR
There's nothing I can do. Little fella's
just... lost his will to live.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!


[Cartmanland... ahem, North Park Funland, day. The old North
Park Funland sign is being restored, as are many of the rides
Cartman replaced. The ticket booths are missing. A bulldozer
sits outside the park ready to clear out anything else that needs
removal. Cartman exits with the million dollars he originally
paid for the park. The money is back on the Radio Flyer]

CARTMAN
Good riddance, you stupid park! You
can all kiss my ass!

AGENT
Excuse me? Eric Cartman?

CARTMAN
Yeah?

AGENT
I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You
haven't kept records of your income
or payout, and there's a five hundred
thousand dollar discrepancy.  Seize
the assets.

CARTMAN
He- Hey, that's my money!

MR. GARRETT
There's also the lawsuit of the little
boy who died in your park. The family's
entitled to the rest of this.

CARTMAN
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!


MR. GARRETT
You still owe thirteen thousand dollars
more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see
you in court.

CARTMAN
Yeh- You can't take my money, Goddamnit!


MR. GARRETT
We know how well your park is doing;
you'll make it back in no time.

CARTMAN
No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey!
Hey Mr. Foon, I changed my mind. I need
the park to make my money back.

MR. FOON
Nohoho way, José!

CARTMAN
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't
have the park I lose everything!

MR. FOON
"I don't care," said Pierre. "I'm from
France."

CARTMAN
This can't be happening! AAAAAHH!!


[Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan bursts into Kyle's room]

STAN
Kyle, you gotta see!!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley.
Oh, Gerald!

STAN
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here
on his bed with the machines attached?


DOCTOR
Well, I sssuppsed it could be rigged,
but I-

STAN
Then damnit man, do it!

[North Park Funland, day. The ticket booths are back, and business
is as strong now as it was when the park was Cartmanland. Off
to the side, Cartman is throwing stones at one of the park walls]


CARTMAN
It isn't fair!  You Goddamned assholes,
it isn't fair!

STAN
Look, Kyle. Look.

KYLE
Huh?

CARTMAN
You just build me up to chop me down,
didn't you?! What about my dream?! What
about my money?!

KYLE
Huh?

CARTMAN
I'M SO PISSED OFF!

SECURITY GUARD
Move along, sir! You are vandalizing
private property!

CARTMAN
Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut
aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonfofabitch!


STAN
Kyle!

DOCTOR
He's coming back.

KYLE'S MOTHER
That's it, baby. That's it.

CARTMAN
Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!

DOCTOR
Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is
going into remission!

HEMORRHOID
Oh, shih.

STAN
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.
Even more miserable than he was before
because he's had his dream and lost
it.

CARTMAN
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna
die! I wanna daaahahie!

KYLE
You are up there!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 617


"RED SLEIGH DOWN"


Written by


Trey Parker





[Cartman's house, day. In his room, Cartman has Kyle's cousin
Kyle tally up his good and bad deeds to see where he will end
up this year. Cousin Kyle is seated at Cartman's desk with piles
of paper to go through and an adding machine to keep it all current.]


COUSIN KYLE
Av-a-a-alright, I'm done.

CARTMAN
You're done?

COUSIN KYLE
Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times
you've been naughty and deducted the
times you've been nice.

CARTMAN
Yeah, so how's it look?

COUSIN KYLE
It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't
look good.

CARTMAN
But I'll still be getting presents this
year, right?

COUSIN KYLE
a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna
owe Santa three hundred and six presents.


CARTMAN
What?!

COUSIN KYLE
Four thousand three hundred and twelve
instances of being naughty against three
deductions of being nice, is is, is
bad.

CARTMAN
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice
invoices! Look look! What about this
one?

COUSIN KYLE
Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde
in the balls with slingshot" really
counted as nice.

CARTMAN
It was nice for Token; he laughed for
like 20 minutes.

COUSIN KYLE
Ye you can't deduct things like that,
Eric. Santa will know and then he'll
come after you.

CARTMAN
God-damnit I have to get that Haibo
robot doll, you sonofabitch!

COUSIN KYLE
Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice
accoutant! Don't blame me for the numbers!


CARTMAN
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's
like a pet, a robot pet. You have to
feed it and pet it or else it dies,
and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa
has to bring me one!

COUSIN KYLE
But what, look, aren't there any other
nice things you've done recently we
can write off here?

CARTMAN
Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!


COUSIN KYLE
Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty
or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more
into the category of... brushing your
teeth.

CARTMAN
Well there's still time before Christmas!
Can't I still make up for it?

COUSIN KYLE
If you cure cancer... and AIDS next
week, you would still owe two presents.


CARTMAN
Jesus Christ!

COUSIN KYLE
Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find
a way to do... the nicest, greaatest
thing anyone has ever done. Ever.


[South Park city hall, outside, night. A decorated Christmas
tree stands at one side of the entrance as the Mayor stands at
the dais]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Good evening, everyone. In a moment
we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas
Tree to kick off the holidays!

TOWNSFOLK
Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
Christmas Tree!

CARTMAN
Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God
bless one, everyone!

KYLE
What are you doing, Cartman?

CARTMAN
I'm just letting you know how special
you are to me.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
But now, before we light the tree, I
think we should all reflect for a moment
on those who are less fortunate than
us.  Right now in Iraq there are children
who fear us and what we might do to
their country. The threat of war touches
us all, but over in Iraq, their is no
Christmas. They have nothing.

JIMBO
Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas
for her own political agenda.  Light
the damn tree!

TOWNSFOLK
YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!


CARTMAN
You guys, that's it!

KYLE
What's it?

CARTMAN
Don't you see? This time of year we
should be bringing Christmas to the
less fortunate! Follow me!  You guys,
come on! Right now!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Ahalright, here to light the Christmas
Tree is a very special young man who
shows us all the true meaning of Christmas.
Jimmy.

JIMMY
Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank
you for giving me this great honor,
Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree,
I was wondering if I could sing... my
favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.


TOWNSFOLK
Awww

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't
we, folks?

TOWNSFOLK
Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas
songs!

JIMMY
Alright, h-here it goes. On the first
day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my
tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh...
gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m...
me... a pa... a pa... pah...

MR. GARRISON
Oh no.

[Cartman's house, night. Cartman is rushing out of his house
with all sorts of presents. Stan and Kyle just stand there looking
at him run around.]

CARTMAN
...and here's some old toys that I
don't need anymore.  And here! Here's
some Christmas cookies!  And some holly
and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest
Christmas the Middle East has ever seen!
Guys, get those lights down from the
door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis,
too.

STAN
Cartman, why are you doing this?

CARTMAN
They don't have Christmas there, guys.
We have to give it to them.

KYLE
That's a retarded idea that won't work.
Why are you really doing this?

A VOICE
Hoooowwwwdy ho!

KYLE
Mr. Hankey!

CARTMAN
Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.
Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas
to you!

MR. HANKEY
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy
out here. What are you boys doin'?


KYLE
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas
to Iraq.

CARTMAN
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas
just like everyone else.

MR. HANKEY
Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really
have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone
who can help. Santa Claus!

CARTMAN
Really?

STAN, KYLE
Really?

MR. HANKEY
Sure. We should take this stuff to him
right away!

KYLE
But how are we gonna get to the North
Pole?

MR. HANKEY
Oh, that's no problem! We just need
a little Christmas magic.  All aboad
the Poo Choo Express!

CARTMAN
Wow!

STAN
Wuh, that smells.

KYLE
Yeah.

MR. HANKEY
Next stop, the North Pole!

CARTMAN
Get the rest of the stuff you guys!


STAN
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there.


KYLE
Me neither.

CARTMAN
You guys, we have to bring Christmas
to those less fortunate!  Now come on!


MR. HANKEY
Let's go, Poo Choo Train!

WHISTLE
Poo Choo!

MR. HANKEY
Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks
with a

WHISTLE
Poo Choo!

MR. HANKEY
All the way and back!

CARTMAN
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing,
spreading Christmas joy as we ride and
sing!

KYLE
Dude, what the hell has gotten into
Cartman??

STAN
I don't know.

MR. HANKEY
Christmastime wouldn't be the same without
hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.


[from a view in space, the train is seen making its way to the
North Pole]

[South Park. Jimmy is still singing]

JIMMY
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear
t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...


[The North Pole. The Poo Choo Train pulls into view, then stops]


MR. HANKEY
Here we are, kids. The North Pole.


STAN
Awww!

KYLE
Finally!

STAN
God, it took forever!

CARTMAN
Wow, is that where Santa lives?

MR. HANKEY
That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude.


GNOME 1
Mr. Hankey!

MR. HANKEY
We need to see Santa right away on urgent
Christmas business.

GNOME 1
Sure thing!

[The workshop. The group enters. Gnomes are busy everywhere,
moving gifts around, decorating Christmas trees]

KYLE
Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants
gnomes?

GMOME 1
Ten months out of the year. But this
time of year we help Santa!  Here he
is!

SANTA
Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Wow!

MR. HANKEY
Howdy ho, Santa!

SANTA
Mr. Hankey, how are you?

MR. HANKEY
All ready for Christmas?

SANTA
I was just starting to look over the
new naughty and nice list the gnomes
prepared for me.

CARTMAN
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all
closed up then?

SANTA
Oh no, they keep it open until midnight
of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually
try to cram in a lot of niceness right
at the end.

CARTMAN
Oh, that's so lame of them.

MR. HANKEY
Santa, my friends are trying to do something
very special this Christmas. Tell him,
Eric.

CARTMAN
Well Santa, it's just that... I was
thinking about the people in Iraq who
are afraid that we might bomb them and
I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't
hurt to send them a little bit of our
Christmas spirit as well.

SANTA
You know you're right. Santa hasn't
been to that of the world in a looong
time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace
to this whole situation.

CARTMAN
That's what I thought.

SANTA
Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys!
Santa's going to make a special run!


MR. HANKEY
All right!

SANTA
And you boys can all watch me from our
flight control room.

CARTMAN
Hooray!

[South Park. Jimmy is still singing]

JIMMY
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear
tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas
my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.


[The North Pole Flight Control Room. The gnomes and boys enter
the room, which is fully decorated in Christmas cheer]

GNOME 1
This is Santa's flight control center.
From here, we can monitor Santa from
satellite as he travels the globe delivering
presents.

KYLE
Wow, cool!

MR. HANKEY
Hey, it looks like Santa has already
made it to Baghdad.

[Baghdad, Iraq. Santa sails over the city]

SANTA
Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!
Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!


IRAQI MAN 1
Paka klakalaka

IRAQI MAN 2
Anah kakadakadaka.

SANTA
Merry Christmas!  I'm hit! I'm hit!


GNOME 1
Sleigh is hit! I repeat! Sleigh is hit!


GNOME 2
Ultimate failure at o-sixhundred feet!


SANTA
Hold on!  Sleigh is going down!

GNOME 1
Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh
is going down!

STAN
Hang on, Santa!

GNOME 3
Sleigh 1 is going down! We are going
down!

GNOME 4
Don't look down! Don't look down! Repeat!
Don't look down!

GNOME 1
We got a red sleigh down. We got a
red sleigh down.  Red Sleigh 2, this
is North Pole.  Red Sleigh 1, this is
North Pole.  Mr. Kringle?

GNOME 5
Jesus Christ, they killed him!

CARTMAN
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He...
He can't.

STAN
Wny would Iraqis do that? Why?

MR. HANKEY
It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy
of them.

SANTA
North Pole. This is Santa.

MR. HANKEY
Santa! Are you alright?

GNOME 2
What is your status?

SANTA
Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead.
Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's...
very sad. Santa will have to... oh no.
They're coming for me!  Stay back, you
bastards! Stay back!

STAN
Oh no.

CARTMAN
Well what are you gnomes sitting there
for?! You have to go rescue him!

GNOME 5
What the hell are we supposed to do?!
We're like nine inches tall!

CARTMAN
Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot
doll!

KYLE
Is that what this is all about?!  You
came up with this whole idea so you
could get a stupid toy?!

CARTMAN
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you
can starve! If you don't feed it, it
dies. It's sooo cool.

STAN
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to
you, there's not gonna be any Christmas,
and there's no one left to help us!


CARTMAN
Oh, Christ.

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Jesus!

MR. HANKEY
Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody.


GNOME 2
Follow me. You can take Santa's backup
sleigh.

[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of
Christmas]

JIMMY
On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas,
...my t-true love gave to... uh...
me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring...
rings.  Fuhgom... don... t-t... don...
four cal...ling buh-irr

[The North Pole, Fortress of Solitude]

GNOME 2
We fed Jesus Christ's data into the
autopilot. This slide should be able
to take you right to him.

STAN
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as
good as dead.

GNOME 2
Here it is. Red Sleigh 2.

CARTMAN
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save
Christmas!

MR. HANKEY
Tell Santa's workers to keep making
toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!


KYLE
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?


GNOME 2
You just have to call out the reindeer's
names.

CARTMAN
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-


GNOME 2
No, no, they're all dead. You have to
call out the new ones.  On Steven, on
Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. On Skippy,
on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel.
Good luck finding Jesus!

[The night sky. The boys sail along the winds]

CARTMAN
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in
Santa's sleigh!

MR. HANKEY
We should be able to find Jesus in no
time!

CARTMAN
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high
above the trees at Christmastime. With
candy-cane wishes and smiles-

KYLE
What are you doing?

CARTMAN
I'm having a precious Christmastime
moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.

KYLE
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna
get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't
forget: it's because of you that Santa's
sleigh got shot down!

CARTMAN
Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis
are filled with hate!

KYLE
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take
a lot of singing to make up for that!


CARTMAN
It's Christmas magic time, inside the
sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with
candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...


[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of
Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier]

JIMMY
Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh
...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du...
Four calling biiirds

[Baghdad. Santa is being hauled down a hall by three Iraqi soldiers.
He's got bruises here and there, a bloody nose, a black eye.
They enter a room]

SANTA
Where are you taking me??  You are all
being very naughty.

IRAQI GENERAL
Why you come to Iraq, my main man?


SANTA
To bring happiness and joy to the children.


IRAQI GENERAL
And this is...?  This is what you think
brings happy?  This is material...
This is commercialism! My country is
sick. Sick!

SANTA
No, your country has just lost all its
Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?!


IRAQI GENERAL
America wants to bomb my house, my main
man. They want to kill my wife and children.
We need to know... what is their plan?


SANTA
I don't know, I live in the North Pole.
What are you doing??

IRAQI GENERAL
They say that the Chinese were the first
to experiment with a little shock to
the testicles.

SANTA
Oh no. Not Santa's balls!

IRAQI GENERAL
What else is America planning?!

SANTA
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

IRAQI GENERAL
You're not in a position to kill anyone,
my main man! I just want you to tell
me America's plan!

SANTA
Then we're in for a long night, 'cause
I don't know shit!

[An Italian church. Jesus stands at the altar receiving parishioners,
blessing them for one thing or another]

JESUS
In nome del mio padre, siete guarito.


ELDERLAY MAN
Benedicali! Benedicali!

WOMAN
Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi.


JESUS
Il vostro bambino se arguisto.

WOMAN
Bene, Benedicali!  La morte rossa!


MR. HANKEY
Hooowdy ho!

CARTMAN
Jesus!

JESUS
Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman.
What are you doing here, my children?


STAN
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down
over Iraq!

JESUS
Santa? Is he alright?

KYLE
We don't know. They lost all contact
with him.

JESUS
We have to get him out of there.

MR. HANKEY
Do you know a way?

JESUS
Yes. Yes, I think I do.  We need a little
Christmas miracle.  Lock and load! We're
goin' in!

[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of
Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier]

JIMMY
On the s...seventh day of Christmas
my t...true love ...

[The interrogation room. The general continues shock treatment
on Santa's balls.]

IRAQI GENERAL
You're a sick capitalist dog, my main
man!

[Baghdad. Jesus, Mr. Hankey, and the boys arrive and sail over
the city]

CARTMAN
This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!
I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate
people.

GNOME
Red Sleiogh 2, come in.

STAN
We're here.

GNOME
You're coming up on the source of the
signal. You're right on top of him!


JESUS
He must be in that building below us.
Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.

MR. HANKEY
Howdy ho, Jesus.

SOLDIER 1
Gankueda!

JESUS
Wait here, I can handle this.

SOLDIER 2
Kinkeda? Kinkakueda!

JESUS
Yay, look upon me, and know me.

SOLDIER 1
Halak balah!

SOLDIER 2
Kli malah!

JESUS
My children, you should know something.
I'm packing.  Let's go!

CARTMAN
This is such a magical Christmas adventure,
you guys.

[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of
Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier]

JIMMY
On the el- el- el- eleventh of C- Christmas
my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven
p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...

[The interrogation room. The general is now making Santa swallow
a can of oil]

IRAQI GENERAL
Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all
you Western capitalists want!

SANTA
Jesus Christ!

IRAQI GENERAL
Ach!

SANTA
Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus!


JESUS
Here.  Can you walk?

SANTA
Santa's legs are broken.

JESUS
There, they are healed.  Santa...

SANTA
I just couldn't do it.  I just couldn't
let him live. He shocked Santa's balls!


MR. HANKEY
More soldiers are coming!

JESUS
Let's move. Move!

[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of
Christmas.]

JIMMY
Eight... maids are... milking...

[A hallway. Jesus leads the others out]

JESUS
Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on
the roof!

KYLE
Jesus, behind you!

STAN, KYLE, CARTMAN
Jesus!

SANTA
No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry,
Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.


JESUS
You're a... bad liar.  Yay. B-but we
sure gave them one hell of a fight,
huh?

SANTA
We sure did, Jesus

STAN
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right
here.

JESUS
Uh Santa?

SANTA
I'm here, Jesus.

JESUS
Don't... don't ever... let them take
away... our... Christmas spirit.


STAN
Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.


KYLE
You bastards.

SANTA
Come on, kids!

[The building's rooftop. Santa leads the boys out while firing
at the pursuing Iraqi soldiers]

SANTA
Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh!


MR. HANKEY
Start the sleigh!

STAN
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace,
on Chantel. Uhh...

KYLE
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on
Montel.

CARTMAN
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's
sleigh. It's Christmas special time
for me-

KYLE
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas
act isn't fooling anybody!

CARTMAN
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted
was for these people to understand what
Christmas means.

SANTA
You're right, kid.

MR. HANKEY
What are you doin', Santa?

SANTA
I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and
by God I'm gonna do it!

[Panels on either side of the sleigh body open up to reveal bombs
and a controller rises up in front of Santa. He releases the
reins and fires a rocket. It heads for a building and Iraqis
move out of the way. It hits its target, but instead of destroying
it, the bomb decorates the building in Christmas cheer. Strings
of lights decorate the windows and a Christmas tree appears at
the door. "Joy To The World" plays as snow comes down from the
sky. The Iraqis approach in wonder]

SANTA
Hohoho! Merry Christmas!

SOLDIER
Dakadaka!

STAN
RPG, four o'clock!

[Santa activates a laser, which rises over the boys and fires
at the soldier's bazooka. It becomes a giant candy cane. The
soldiers are surprised. Santa fires at a group of people holding
baskets of bread and a woman holding a chicken. The baskets become
gifts, while the chicken becomes a large gingerbread man. A rifle
in one man's hands becomes a Christmas wreath.]

MR. HANKEY
Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy
now!

SANTA
Merry Christmas! Hohoho!

[Santa makes another pass down a decorated street and drops five
more bombs. They leave behind five snowmen. The Iraqis are surprised
and confused by all these presents. The kids are terribly pleased
with theirs.]

SANTA
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a
good night! Hohohohoho!

[South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of
Christmas. The mayor's assistants are asleep and the mayor is
getting sleepy]

JIMMY
And a p-p-par-tridge in a p-peeeaaar
treeee.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
That's it? That's it! The song's over!
We can light the tree!

TOWSFOLK
Hurrah! Woohoo! Yay!

JIMBO
Oh, finally!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more
seconds until Christmas!

TOWSFOLK
Awwww!

RANDY
Christmas is ruined again!

SANTA
Ho ho ho!

TOWSFOLK
WOW!!!

RANDY
Stan!

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle!

KYLE
Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!


STAN
We brought Christmas to Iraq!

SANTA
Everyone! Everyone, can I please have
your attention?  Christmas is a very
special time of year, but... this year
it almost didn't happen. There's a man
named Jesus who gave his life to save
me. And so I declare that every year
on Christmas Day. we should remember
Jesus for what he did, and thank him
for it. From now on, Christmas will
be a day for remembering a brave man
named Jesus.

TOWSFOLK
Hooray!

SANTA
Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got
a lot of work to do.

MR. HANKEY
I'll help you, Santa!

SANTA
Oh, and boys, you might want to check
under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas!

STAN
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all
Haibo dolls!

CARTMAN
Oh, God-damnit!

KYLE
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was
a Haibo doll!

CARTMAN
Yeah, but not if you guys have one,
too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit
I'll never try to be nice again!


STAN
Well, all in all, I have to say this
was a pretty special Christmas.

KENNY
(Hey guys. What's goin' on?)

STAN
Oh, hey Kenny.

KYLE
Dude, where have you been?

KENNY
(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)

KYLE
Well come on! We gotta tell you what
happened. I'm sure glad it's over with.


STAN
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally
back to normal.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 808


"DOUCHE AND TURD"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. Grass shows up around the edges
of the snow-covered lawns and around the flagpole.]

[The school gym. Six cheerleaders, all fourth-graders, lead a
Pep Rally '04.]

CHEERLEADERS
We are South Park, Green and White.
Let's go, Cows! Fight fight fight! Nobody
can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park!


RED
Hey, South Park! Do you have school
spirit?

STUDENTS
Moooooooo!

BEBE
I think us Cows have the best school
spirit. Huh, Mandy?

MANDY
Yeah, and South Park is really gonna
stick it to Littleton next week!

BEBE
Let's bring out our mascot and get this
pep rally going!

BUTTERS
It's Billy! Uh, Billy will wave for
me! Wave for me, Billy!

BLONDE PETA WOMAN
We are People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals! We protest your insensitive
use of cows as your school mascot!


MR. GARRISON
Oh Jesus, not PETA again.

DREADLOCKED PETA MAN
Culled or maimed and slaughtered and
used as a commodity!

BLOND PETA MAN
This is unfair to the cows! This is
your insensitivity!

STUDENTS
EWWW!

MAN WEARING GAS MASK
The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity!
To be thrown away by a society gone
wrong!

[Mr. Garrison's class, day. The class is seated]

MR. GARRISON
All right, children, I have just been
informed that since our school has been
attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th
time, we are going to change our school
mascot.

CLASS
AWWWWWWWWW!!!

STAN
Buh, Mr. Garrision, if we change our
mascot, that means the eco-terrorists
win!

MR. GARRISON
That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists
win.  Now, I have here a mascot selection
sheet. Every student is supposed to
check the box next to the mascot they
like the most. And the most popular
selection will be the school's new mascot.


CLYDE
But we like being the Cows!

DREADLOCKED PETA MAN
You're responsible for the enslavement
and genocide of millions!

MR. GARRISON
Get, get outta here, PETA! We're changin'
the mascot already!

DREADLOCKED PETA MAN
Who'll speak for those who cannot speak
for themselves??

MR. GARRISON
Go on, get, get outta here!  Get, get
out!  Jesus, where do they keep coming
from??  Go on, get outta here.

STAN
This is bullcrap, dude!

MR. GARRISON
Now children, it's not that bad. There's
plenty of great new mascots on the sheet
to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards,
the Redskins, the Indians...

WENDY
But aren't Indians and Redskins just
as offensive?

MR. GARRISON
No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care
about people.

[The school hallway]

CARTMAN
Goddamnit PETAns piss me off! We're
never gonna end up with a stupid eagle
or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.

KYLE
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea!
We should secretly go around and tell
all the students we can to not check
any of the mascots on this election
sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."


CARTMAN
Ye-heah!

KENNY
(Yeah, totally awesome!)

CARTMAN
Yeh- no, no, wait wait wait. I got a
better idea you guys. What we should
do is we should secretly go around and
tell all the students we can to not
check any of the mascots on this election
sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."


KYLE
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant
Douche.

CARTMAN
Heh, it's only about a thousand times
better, am I right guys? Come on! We
have to tell everybody fast! This is
gonna be soo funny!

KYLE
It was MY idea and we're gonna tell
everyone to write in "Giant Douche!"
It's way funnier!

CARTMAN
IT IS NOT!!!

KYLE
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche
or a turd sandwich?

KENNY
(Giant douche.)

CARTMAN
Aw, you're just saying that because
I broke your cat's leg last week.


KYLE
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd
sandwich?

STAN
Dude, I really don't care.

KYLE
That's two against one, 'cause Stan
doesn't care. So it's giant douche.


CARTMAN
...Wait wait, what about Butters?


BUTTERS
Huh?

KYLE
You hate Butters.

CARTMAN
Goddamnit you guys, Butters is our friend!
And he's allowed to have his opinion!
Butters, which is funnier? A stupid
not-funny giant douche or a super funny
turd sandwich?

BUTTERS
Hahaa, a turd sandwich!

KYLE
You misled him, fatass!

CARTMAN
It's the best choice, and me and Butters
are sticking with it.

BUTTERS
Yeah! ...What's this for?

KYLE
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write
in a mascot that's really funny, and
you have to tell us which one would
be funnier..

JIMMY
That''s a... fantastic idea fellas.
Uh, the key to successful humor is s-
staying power. Uh tell me the first
mascot idea.

KYLE
A giant douche.

JIMMY
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny.
Now, what's the second?

CARTMAN
A turd sandwich.

JIMMY
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait
ten seconds.  Okay now, t-tell me the
first one again?

KYLE
Giant douche.

JIMMY
And the second?

CARTMAN
Turd sandwich.

JIMMY
Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny,
fellas. Uhhhbetter give it another ten
seconds. All right, now we'll see which
one really has staying power. Number
one?

KYLE
A giant douche.

JIMMY
Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?


CARTMAN
Turd sandwich.

JIMMY
Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas.
They're both instant classics. But I
guess I'll have to go with giant douche,
simply because the fact that it's a
giant renders it useless, adding a parody
slant to the satire.

CARTMAN
AWWWW!!

BUTTERS
Ohhh, we lost?

KYLE
All right, it's decided. Let's all write
in "Giant Douche."

CARTMAN
Okay. You win, Kyle.

[The school gym. The students once again assembles on the bleachers.
Mr. Garrison stands before the big-screen TV used in the rally
earlier, and the TV reads "New School Mascot '04"]

MR. GARRISON
Attention students, we have tallied
your mascot nomination sheets, and there
will now be a school-wide vote between
the top two nominations. So here is
the first most-requested candidate,
a giant douche.

KYLE, KENNY
Go giant douche!

GIANT DOUCHE
Hey, South Park! Have we got school
spirit??  We've got spirit, yes we do!
Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo,
Douches!

MR. GARRISON
And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich.


CARTMAN
All right turd sandwich!

BUTTERS
Yeah!

KYLE
Cartman? What the hell??

CARTMAN
Giant Douche sucks!

TURD SANDWICH
We've got spirit, yes we do! We are
sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh!


MR. GARRISON
Students can now cast their choice between
the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich.
We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.


KYLE
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!


CARTMAN
Dream on, Jew boy!

ERIC
Yeah, dream on, Jew boy!

[The front doors of the school. Stan and Kenny flank the entrance
and hand out buttons as the other kids come out]

KYLE
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.

KENNY
(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)

KYLE
Giant Douche is your man!

STAN
Kyle, aren't you taking this a little
too far? I mean, do we really want a
giant douche to be our school mascot?


KYLE
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's
stupid turd sandwich.

CARTMAN
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the
most important election of our lives.
Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change.
A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for
Tomorrow!

KYLE
There. Do you really want that asshole
to win?

STAN
I'm not voting!

KYLE
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't
you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or,
or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die??

STAN
I just think this whole thing is stupid!


KYLE
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand
the importance of voting, because he'll
definitely vote for our guy.

KENNY
(Yeah.)

[The Marsh house, dinnertime. The family is gathered at table,
with Grandpa at one end, Randy at the other. Sharon comes in
with plates and the main course]

SHARON
How was school today, Stanley?

STAN
It was ridiculous. We have to have a
new school mascot and we're supposed
to vote between a giant douche and a
turd sandwich.

SHARON
...What did you say?

RANDY
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?


STAN
No, I think voting is great, but, if
I have to choose between a douche and
a turd, I just don't see the point.


RANDY
You don't see the point!! Oh you young
people just make me sick!

SHARON
Stanley, do you know how many people
died so you could have the right to
vote?!

STAN
Mom, a-I just don't think there's much
of a difference between a douche and
a turd. I d-I don't care.

RANDY
You don't care?! You really want a
turd sandwich as your school mascot?!
On your football helmets?! A turd?!


SHARON
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd
sandwich is a little better than them
having a giant douche on their uniforms.


RANDY
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least
clean!

SHARON
It's sexist is what it is!

RANDY
You don't understand the issues, Sharon!


SHARON
Are you calling me ignorant??

RANDY
You think the school mascot should be
a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly
Einstein!

SHARON
I am sick of you belittling my opinion,
you son of a bitch!

SHELLEY
I hate this family, I hate it!

STAN
Puff Daddy?

PUFF DADDY
Your friend Kyle said you don't understand
the importance of voting.

STAN
I...

PUFF DADDY
Apparently you haven't heard of my "Vote
or Die" campaign.

STAN
"Vote or Die"?  What the hell does that
even mean?!

PUFF DADDY
What you think it means, bitch!

STAN
AAAAH!!

[Music video. Stan is running down the street. An open-roof car
pops up behind him and bears down on him]

POSSE
Vote or die, mother_, mother_er, vote
or die!

PUFF DADDY
Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick
a knife through your eye.

POSSE
Democracy is founded on one simple rule!


[Overhead shot of Puff Daddy, dressed in a white suit, then in
a black suit.]

PUFF DADDY
Get out there and vote or I will mother__
kill you.

Yeh.

[at a polling station encouraging one female voter]

PUFF DADDY
I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)


Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)

[seated as two women dance for him, their asses in his face]


PUFF DADDY
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof
(mouth roof)

[gently spanks a woman as she goes in to vote]

PUFF DADDY
Now get your big ass in the pollin'
booth.

[Fish-eye overhead view of Puff Daddy. He shoves his gun into
the camera]

PUFF DADDY
I said vote, bitch, or I'll f_____ kill
you!

[Stan runs until he sees a passageway between two buildings.
He does in to try to escape, but Puff Daddy and his crew find
him]

POSSE
Vote or die, mother_, mother_, vote
or die!

PUFF DADDY
You can't run from a .38, go ahead and
try!

[Puffy is seated in an armchair wearing a wig, surrounded by
women, all in front of a Vegas-style sign saying "DIDDY"]

POSSE
Let your opinion be heard! You gotta
make a choice

[raps to a chrome reflection]

PUFF DADDY
'Cause after I slit your throat you
won't have a f____ voice

[Stan runs again, looking behind him, but runs into a gun in
his face]

PUFF DADDY
'Vote or die! Vote or die!

[Puff Daddy's gun is joined by the guns of his posse. Stan is
looking at five barrels]

STAN
Okay. I'll vote.

[Cartman and Butters begin door-to-door campaigning. Cartman
knocks on a door and Clyde answers.]

CARTMAN
Hello, Clyde.

CLYDE
What do you guys want?

CARTMAN
We were just wondering who you might
be voting for, for the school's new
mascot.

CLYDE
I haven't decided yet.

CARTMAN
Oh really? Well that's interesting.
You certainly should think about it
and make the right decision.  Butterscotch
candy?

CLYDE
Sure.

CARTMAN
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich
can bring to our school?

BUTTERS
A turd sandwich is not only the first
turd to be nominated school mascot,
but even the first, sandwich.

CARTMAN
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to
our school, Clyde, is a complete package.
The turd and the coin. And the lettuce,
and the olives.

BUTTERS
Whe-whereas Giant Douche is just, well,
ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.


CARTMAN
So, come voting day, you'll now most
likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?


CLYDE
I'm still not totally sure.

CARTMAN
Well then, perhaps we could interest
you in  another butterscotch candy?


[South Park Elementary, now a polling station. A "Vote for School
Mascot!" hangs on the back wall and over the hallway. A reluctant
Kyle takes a ballot, and Kyle smiles, thinking he has Stan on
his side]

KYLE
You're doing the right thing, Stan.
Don't you feel like you're a part of
something now?

STAN
I guess...

KYLE
Look, it may not seem important now,
but your vote really does count, and
we all have to do our part.

STAN
Okay.

KYLE
Look... wait, what are you doing?

STAN
I'm voting.

KYLE
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.


STAN
Yeah, I know.

KYLE
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for
Giant Douche.

STAN
I thoght I was supposed to make my
own decision.

KYLE
Well yeah, but not if your decision
is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell
is wrong with you?!

STAN
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to
vote, you wanted me to vote for your
guy!

KYLE
Well, I just figured you'd vote for
my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!
Puffy!

CARTMAN
Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them
intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk
you to the booth. And then I'm gonna
buy you a niiice steak dinner with all
the trimmings.

STAN
Oh forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded
into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna
be threatened into voting if I don't
feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna
vote and you can all just live with
it!

[The Principal's Office, later]

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
We've simply had it with your son, Mr.
and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't
appear to be important to 'im.

RANDY
Stanley, when you left for school this
morning, you said you were going to
vote!

STAN
The whole thing is a joke!

SHARON
You see? He's out of control. It's nearly
torn our whole family apart.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer
have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the
other children. He must be removed.


RANDY
Ogh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just
got yourself suspended!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Nno, I'm afraid it's worse than that.
By county law I'm bound to enforce the
harshest punishment possible.

RANDY
Expulsion??

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
No. Banishment.

STAN
B-bani-banishment?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
You can appeal to the city council,
but I don't think it'll do any good.
Your son must leave South Park, never
to return.

SHARON
Oh, Randy!

RANDY
Our son, banished. Where did we go wrong??


STAN
Ya... you're all joking, right?

[A moonlit partly-cloudy night in South Park. The townsfolk are
gathered at the edge of town, with Stan facing them all alone.
A horse stands at the ready on one side of Main Street.]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
As it was in the times of our forefathers,
so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following
our most sacred of rites, you are hereby
banished from South Park for all eternity.
Or until you decide that voting is important.
Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you
more kindly than we did.

KYLE
Stan, don't you think this has gone
far enough? Is it really that big a
deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.


STAN
I'm not voting!

A BODYGUARD
You, Puffy man, are we just gonna let
this happen?  We've gots to kill this
non-votin' fool!

PUFF DADDY
No, Justacious, let him go. He won't
survive a fortnight in the wilderness.


RANDY
This is breaking your mother's heart,
Stan. She couldn't even help tie you
to the horse.

STAN
Dad, isn't this a little extreme?

RANDY
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand
how important voting is.  Goodbye, Stan.
That's... one of the hardest things
a parent ever has to do.

[A plain, night. Stan rides into the night and into the morning
on the plain, then through a desert, then into a forest. A group
of people appear and spot him]

A MAN
Look! What is that?

A WOMAN
Oh, the poor thing!

STAN
Hello?

A WOMAN
Don't worry, we'll free you.

A MAN
Just sit still for a moment.

STAN
Oh thank God.

A MAN
Get offa him, you filthy human!

BLONDE
Poor thing needs water.

BEARDED MAN
You'er safe now.

BLONDE
Shame on you, making this horse your
slave.

STAN
Awww!

BLONDE
Come, you can live with us.

BEARDED MAN
We will give you food and shelter.


STAN
What about me?

BEARDED MAN
OPEN THE GATE!

BLONDE 2
This poor creature is in need of food
and water.

BALDING MAN
You have a home here, friend.

BEARDED MAN
The... kid wants to stay, too.

STAN
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna
ride it.

BALDING MAN
I don't know if you can stay. We'll
have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We
don't normally allow outsiders. See,
here we live in harmony with animals.
They're not our pets but our fellow
living beings. We work with the animals
and try to live as they do.  We make
friends with the animals. We coexist,
and we... intermarry.  This is my wife,
Janice.  The outside world looks down
on a man marrying a llama, but our love
knows no boundaries.

STAN
Wow, you guys really love animals.


BALDING MAN
And why not? Mark here has been with
Kelly for three years now.  And Gary
and Sally here have just managed to
have a child together.

OSTRICH-BABY
Kill me...

BALDING MAN
Yes, life here is good and natural.
But now that you know where our compound
is, you'll either have to live with
us, or be murdered.

STAN
I'll live with you.

BALDING MAN
It's not up to you. You'll have to talk
with Dr. Cornwallis.  What did he say?


STAN
He said I can stay

BALDING MAN
Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond
his year. Here's your PETA shirt and
a bumper sticker.

ANNOUNCER
This is Debate 2004 with your host,
Jim Lehrer.

JIM LEHRER
Welcome to the cable-access televised
debate between a giant douche  and a
turd sandwich  We'll start with Giant
Douche. Sir, some students and parents
are reluctant to have a... giant douche
represent them. What do you say to those
people?

GIANT DOUCHE
Jim, first of all I would like to thank
you for monitoring this debate. And
I would like to thank all of the students
and their parents for coming.

CARTMAN
Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! It's
an obvious suck-up move.

GIANT DOUCHE
But I would hope that those students
and their parents who question my qualities
would simply look at my opponent. He
is a turd sandwich

TURD SANDWICH
You're a turd sandwich.

GIANT DOUCHE
... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you
are in fact, the turd sandwich.

TURD SANDWICH
You're a turd sandwich.

GIANT DOUCHE
... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.

TURD SANDWICH
You're a turd sandwich.

JIM LEHRER
Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not
to speak out of turn.

TURD SANDWICH
I I'm sorry, Jim.

GIANT DOUCHE
Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait,
I I forgot what I was saying.

TURD SANDWICH
Ha. Wha-hat a douche.

JIM LEHRER
All right, Turd Sandwich, this next
question is for you. How should South
Park Elementary enforce its laws of
conduct for young athletes during sporting
events.

TURD SANDWICH
... Uh you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't
even know the answer to that question.
If you ask him the same question, he
would not answer it.  He would stand
around and just babble on and on about
nothing until he was finally saved by
the buzzer sound.

JIM LEHRER
Your time is up, Turd.

[The PETA compound, next morning. Stan scrubs away at the empty
tubs and buckets of food the animals ate from the previous day.
The bald man approachs]

BALDING MAN
Stan, I want to introduce you to my
stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to
have taken a liking to you.  And she's
ovulating.

STAN
Ahh no thanks, that's okay.

BALDING MAN
Stan, some PETA members are growing
concerned that maybe you don't love
animals.

STAN
I do love animals, just ...nnot like
you guys do.

BALDING MAN
You... don't belong here, Stan. You
should return home.

STAN
I can't. I was banished for not voting.


BALDING MAN
But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna
vote?

STAN
I think voting is great. I just didn't
care this time because it was between
a giant douche and a turd sandwich.


BALDING MAN
But Stan, don't you know, it's always
between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Nearly every election since the beginning
of time has been between some douche
and some turd. They're the only people
who suck up enough to make it that far
in politics.

STAN
I guess... I guess you're right.

PUFF DADDY
Yo, what did I say was going to happen
to you, bitch?

STAN
AAAAAH!

MAN IN SHORTS
Aaaah!! He's wearing the skin of an
animal!  Take that!  I... hope that
teaches you a lesson about being hurt.


PUFF DADDY
Itius, Rodicus!

BODYGUARD
Vote or die!

STAN
AAAAH!!

PETA MAN
Protect the animals! Protect the animals!


BALDING MAN
Janice, we shall die together in each
other's arms!

OSTRICH-BABY
Kill me! Kill meee!!

[South Park Elementary polling station. Mr. Mackey tallies up
the votes.]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, that's one more vote for Turd
Sandwich.

RANDY
So who won, Mr. Mackey?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
It's pretty close, but it looks like
Giant Douche is gonna win.

CARTMAN
Oh no! NOOO!!

KYLE
HA! You lose, fatass!

BUTTERS
Uh hey, wait a minute!

RANDY
Stan!

SHARON
Stan, you came back. Does that mean...
you learned the importance of voting?


STAN
I learned that I'd better get used to
having to pick between a douche and
a turd sandwich because it's usually
the choice I'll have.

RANDY
He's going to vote!!

TOWNSFOLK
He's going to vote. He's going to vote.


SINGER
Let's get out the vote! Let's make our
voices heard!

We've been given the right to choose between a douche and a turd.


It's democracy in action! Put your freedom to the test.

A big fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Stan's vote bring the total votes for
Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And
Giant Douche has... one thousand four
hundred and ten. Giant Douche still
wins.

SOME TOWNSFOLK
Yeah! All right!

OTHER TOWNSFOLK
AWWWW!!

STAN
Dude, so my vote didn't even really
matter!

RANDY
Hey! That's not true, Stan.

SHARON
You can't judge the merits of voting
on whether or not your candidate won.


RANDY
Your vote still mattered.

MR. GARRISON
Hey everybody!  They just found all
the PETA members murdered at their compound!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
What the? They're all dead? Well, that
means...

CLYDE
That we can go back to being the South
Park Cows!

ALL
Hooray! All right!

RANDY
Naw, your vote didn't matter.

"DIE HIPPIE, DIE!"


Written by


Trey Parker





[An elderly woman's home. Cartman rings her doorbell, and she
answers it. Cartman is dressed in an orange hazmat suit and is
carrying a tank of something on his back]

CARTMAN
Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up
the neighborhood from parasites. Do
you mind if I take a quick look around
your house? I'm afraid you may have
hippies.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Hippies?

CARTMAN
Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over
the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson
next door had seven hippies in her basement;
they usually live in colonies.  Hm,
I don't like the sound of that. Could
I take a look in your attic?

[The attic. He opens the door and looks in. He gets out a flashlight,
turns it on, and looks around again. He stops after a few seconds.]


CARTMAN
Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.
See that? Hippies.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh my.

CARTMAN
These are what we call the uh giggling
stoners. Pretty common form of hippie,
usually found in the attics. Problem
is, if you see one hippie, there's probably
a whole lot more you're not seein'.
Uh, whe-where's the backyard.

[The backyard. The elderly lady opens the door and Cartman walks
out onto the back porch]

CARTMAN
Yep, that's what I thought. See that?
You've got a drum circle in your backyard.


ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, well they showed up a few days ago,
but I didn't think they were hurting
anything.

CARTMAN
Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson
county. He had a little drum circle
in his backyard. It turned into a drum
circle four miles in diameter. You get
a few hippies playing drums and next
thing you know, you got yourself a colony.


ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh dear.

[back inside the house]

ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh, well, so, so what do I do?

CARTMAN
Well, your attic could be so we can
fumigate with polymerethane. The drum
circle we're gonna have to gas.  Goddamnit!


HIPPIE 1
Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm
so high.

CARTMAN
Goddamn hippie!

HIPPIE 1
Whoa, dude!

CARTMAN
Get out of here!

HIPPIE 1
Not cool!  What's up?!

CARTMAN
Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling
stoners and your drum-cricle hippies
RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract
something much worse!

ELDERLY WOMAN
Ooooo.what's that?

CARTMAN
The college know-it-all hippies.

[The neighborhood, day. A red car pulls up to the curb. On the
back window is a decal which says "University of Colorado at
Boulder" Three men and three women step out of the car]

DRIVER
Wow, my friend Brittany was right.
This is a really laid-back place.


WOMAN 1
Yeah, this will be a great place to
spend spring break.

KYLE
Hey, let's ask them.

STAN
All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are
selling magazine subscriptions for our
community youth program. Would you like
to help young people like us by purchasing
a subscription of your choice?

DRIVER
Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing
that. Don't you know what you're doing
to the world?

KYLE
Wha- whataya mean?

MAN 1
You're playing into the corporate game!
See, the corporations are trying to
turn you into little Eichmanns so that
they can make money.

STAN
Who are the corporations?

WOMAN 2
The corporations run the entire world.
And now they fooled you into working
for them.

STAN
Are you serious?? We never heard that.


DRIVER
We just spent our first semester at
college. Our professors opened our eyes.
The government is using its corporate
ties to make you sell magazines so they
can get rich.

KYLE
Ugh! Those dirty liars!

KENNY
(Sonofabitch!)

MAN 2
This is a really nice town you have
here. That's why the corporations are
trying to use you to take it down.


STAN
Well... Well what do we do?

DRIVER
Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill
you in on everything you haven't been
told.

[Cartman's basement. He's gathered a bunch of hippies in there
and one of them pounds the door to get out]

HIPPIE 2
It is time to let us out! I'm sending
your names! Open this door right now!


CARTMAN
All right, in you go.

HIPPIE 2
What are you doing, man?!

HIPPIE 3
Let us out!

CARTMAN
Get back. Get back or you're all gonna
get maced!

HIPPIE 2
What's up, man?! You can't keep us down
here like this!

HIPPIE 4
What's wrong with you?!

CARTMAN
What's wrong is that there's more of
you showing up every day and I need
to find out why!

HIPPIE 5
What makes you think you could tell
us where to live?!

HIPPIE 6
This is a free country, man!

CARTMAN
Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you,
all right? Just go with it.

HIPPIE 3
Just go with it? We've been down here
for days!

CARTMAN
And you're gonna be here a little longer,
brah, all right? Here, here's some joints
, and a guitar!

SINGER
What's goin' on in this world o'mine?


There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine.

Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...

[Stan's house, at about the same time. He's sitting at the edge
of the porch playing a guitar quietly. On his cap he wears a
peace sign]

STAN
Sign, sign everywhere. Sign

Done something to my mind.

SHARON
Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the
mall. Do you wanna come?

STAN
Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate
fatcats to imprison you into a life
of servitude. I've got some stuff you
should read.

SHARON
Okay, sweetie.

[City Hall, City Council meeting. Mayor McDaniels is seated at
the head of a boardroom table, with leading citizens of the town
sitting on either side.]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people, we can move onto
issue number 14B.

CHEF
Mayor, we have got to do somethin'
about all these potholes on our roads!


LINDA STOTCH
We don't have it in the budget to fix
them right now.

KYLE'S FATHER
We'll wish we spent the money when
we have a lawsuit on our hands.

CHEF
We-

GUARD
You can't go in there!

CARTMAN
Please, I have to talk to you all right
now!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Kid, we're have a city council meeting.


CARTMAN
Mayor, something very big is happening,
and if you all don't give me a moment
of your time, there may be no more South
Park to council over!

RANDY
What are you talking about?

CARTMAN
I'm talking about the end of all life
as we know it.  For the past several
days I've been... noticing a steep rise
in the number of hippies coming to town.
At first I thought maybe it was just
a coincidence.  Then I saw this...
Three new drum circles have sprouted
up here, here, and here. They're all
growing in diameter, at a rate of two
hippies per hour. What this means...
is that the hippies are conglomerating.
They'er thriving, if you will. I think
that they're setting up for a... . hippie
music festival.

LINDA
A what?

CARTMAN
Ti's, it's simple science. Look: When
hippies start to nest in a new area,
it draws other hippies in. With the
right weather conditions and topography,
it can lead to a music festival. One
that last for days, even weeks. Reggae
on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man,
they will all pale in comparison to
what we're looking at now. In my professional
opinion... I think we're looking at
a full-blown hippie jam festival the
size of which we've never seen.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Kid, what the hell are you talking about?


CARTMAN
I know hippies. I've hated them all
my life. I've kept this town free of
hippies on my own since I was five and
a half. But I can't contain them on
my own anymore. We have to do something,
fast!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about
potholes right now, m'kay.

CARTMAN
It's not potholes you need to worry
about. It's potheads. I know what these
people are capable of.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
Johnson, get him out of here.

CARTMAN
What are you doing?!  You have to listen
to me! You can't sweep this problem
under the rug!  The town is in serious
danger!

[A park in town. The college hippies sit at a table... and on
it]

DRIVER
You see, the corporations take their
profits and invest it in the war machine
while keeping everyone blind.

STAN
Right, so how do we get back at them?


KYLE
Yeah, we're pissed off.

DRIVER
Well, so my idea was this: Let's have
like a weeklong music festival, draw
everyone here, and then together, we
can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the
hell?!

CARTMAN
I knew you were trying to have a hippie
jam festival! All right, everyone pack
up your crap, we're going to our basement!


KYLE
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!


CARTMAN
Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened?
Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies?
DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!

STAN
NO!

CARTMAN
Listen, you're my friends, but if you've
been comprimised, I'll have no problem
taking you out! I'll expect the same
from you.

MAN 1
What is your problem? Get lost, little
Eichmann.

WOMAN 2
Oh my God!

MAN 2
What the hell are you doing?!

CARTMAN
Everybody get in a single-file line!


OFFICER BARBRADY
There you are!

CARTMAN
Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in
time. These college know-it-all hippies
were setting up for a music festival,
just as I predicted.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Eric Cartman, you are under arrest.


CARTMAN
What?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I was just over at your house and freed
sixty-three people you had locked in
your basement.

CARTMAN
You let them out?! Jesus, we have to
find them!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh no, you're coming downtown!

CARTMAN
No! No, we have to stop them! You know
how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!


DRIVER
Who was that?

[South Park Police Dept. Cartman is in jail, confused]

CARTMAN
What did I do?!

OFFICER BARBRADY
You can't kidnap people and lock them
in your basement.

CARTMAN
They're not people, they're HIPPIES!


MAYOR MCDANIELS.
Is this problem under control?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.

CARTMAN
Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data!
The hippies are going to have a massive
jam band concert!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
I know. I signed the permit.

CARTMAN
You... You what?

MAYOR MCDANIELS
I signed a permit allowing them to have
their concert here. Their little "festival"
should pump some money into our economy.


CARTMAN
They're hippies! They don't HAVE any
money! Does the city council know about
this?!

MAYOR MCDANIELS
They don't have to know. I can sign
whatever permit I want!

CARTMAN
You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!  That kid
really needs some psychiatric help.


OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah.

MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, let's go.

CARTMAN
How much money is enough, Mayor?! How
many people's lives it it all worth?!
GODDAMNED HIPPIE!

[Breaking News]

ANNOUNCER
This is a South Park News special report!


ANCHORMAN
Thousands of people have descended on
South Park for a hippie music jam festival.
The event is said to be the largest
such gathering in the history of man.


MC
All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest
2005!  Sooo great to see sooo many people
turn out to make an impact on on the
world!

STAN
Yeah!

KYLE
You said it!

MC
For too long, the corporations have
bled the world of its love and resources!
It is time for us to get to work and
make the world a better place! And we'reg
onna start right now.

MAN 1
Oh man, I can't wait to see the look
on those little Eichmanns' faces when
they hear this crunchy groove.

[The Marsh house. Sharon and Randy run into each other in the
kitchen]

RANDY
Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?

SHARON
He went with his friends to that music
festival.

RANDY
Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that
kid?!

SHARON
Now, Randy, we were the same way once,
too. Don't forget that we were both
considered hippies back in the '60s.


RANDY
Yeah, but when we did it we actually
stood for something. I mean, remember
Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something
there.

[Flash back to Woodstock, 1969, a crowd scene quite similar to
the current one. Randy jumps into view and yells like a barbarian.
Sharon jumps into view and they both dance around. Sharon turns
and bares her tits and Randy dances so hard he gets dizzy and
throws up.]

SHARON
You ate too much acid, man!

[Flash forward to the present. They consider how such activity
would be seen these days...]

SHARON
...Oh my God. Our son is with those
people.

RANDY
S-stan. STAAAN!

[Breaking News]

ANNOUNCER
This is South Park News!

ANCHORMAN
Fear and horror in South Park today
as the music festival continues to grow.
They're arriving in droves and apparently
no end is in sight.

REPORTER
Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger
and the town is literally bursting at
the seams. We don't know where this
music festival came from, but, it's
very close to consuming us all.

[Butters' house. Linda and Steven hug each other before the TV
as they watch the news brief.]

LINDA
Steven, what do we do?

[Kyle's house. Music is heard outside. Gerald opens the door
and looks out to see hippies milling on his front lawn, and screams.
A view from a long distance shows just how big the crowd has
gotten, then another shot shows the heart of the festival. Randy
is seen looking for his son]

RANDY
Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through,
please!

JIMBO
Randy! Randy, you've got to get out
of here! If they just trample this park,
we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!


RANDY
My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!
Stan! Stan!

MALE HIPPIE
Heey, chill man. It's all good.

FEMALE HIPPIE
Have some water laced with acid.

RANDY
Sta-ogh. Ugh!

[City Hall. The Mayor looks at the festival from her office window.]


MAYOR MCDANIELS
What have I done?

MC
Yeah, South Park is now the hippie capital
of the world!

[South Park Police Department. Cartman relaxes in his cell, having
nothing to do. He senses he's not alone and looks towards the
cell door. The town's adults are on the other side.]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?


CARTMAN
Great, I love crapping in a toilet
with no rim on it.

RANDY
Eric, you were right. About the hippies.
Could you... get rid of them for us
now?

CARTMAN
Let me guess: they've started a hippie
jam band music festival.

KYLE'S MOTHER
We we need to take care of them, Eric!
They're out of control!

CARTMAN
Forget it.

RANDY
Please. Some of our kids are in there.
We should've listened to you earlier.


CHEF
Yeah. We apologise.

KYLE'S FATHER
Please. Don't let them ruin our town.


CARTMAN
It's too late! Even if I did agree to
help, there's too many of them now!


COUNSELOR MACKEY
We know you can do it, Eric. You're
smart. Wha- why you're the smartest
kid in school, m'kay?

RANDY
We're just asking you to try. The whole
town even got together and, and baked
you a cake.

CARTMAN
Don't think that you can buy me with
presents! ...Unless of course it's the
new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.


RANDY
It's yours.

CARTMAN
I want the batteries for it too. And
I get to drive it around in the school
parking lot.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Fine.

JIMBO
Anything else?

CARTMAN
Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one!
Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine
around the school parking lot and get
super-jealous!

KYLE'S MOTHER
Well, we can promise not to buy one
for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch
you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force
Kyle to watch you.

CARTMAN
All right, fine. But now listen up and
listen good! I've never tried to get
rid of this many hippies before, so
I'm gonna need every resource this town
has! And even if I don't succeed, and
it's a million-to-one shot that I will,
I still get the Tonka radio-controlled
bulldozer and get to play with it in
the school parking lot where Kyle has
to watch me and get super-jealous because
he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!


[The music festival, day 6. The crowd has grown so big the camera
has to pull back a loooong way to get it all into view. The boys
are again present with the college hippies. The band is playing
reggae music.]

DRIVER
Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude,
I need more weed.

STAN
So it seems like we have enough people
now. When do we start taking down the
corporations?

MAN 1
Yeah man, the corporations. Right now
they're raping the world for money!


KYLE
Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get
'em.

MAN 2
Right now we're proving we don't need
corporations. We don't need money. This
can become a commune where everyone
just helps each other.

MAN 1
Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who
like, makes bread. A-and one guy who
like, l-looks out for other people's
safety.

STAN
You mean like a baker and a cop?

MAN 2
No no, can't you imagine a place where
people live together and like, provide
services for each other in exchange
for their services?

KYLE
Yeah, it's called a town.

DRIVER
You kids just haven't been to college
yet. But just you wait, this thing is
about to get HUGE.

[Park County Community Center, night. Cartman and the adults
are meeting there. Cartman stands next to an easel with various
pictures on a tabloid-size book]

CARTMAN
All right, everyone listen up! The hippie
jam band festival is now fourteen miles
in diameter and five hundred thousand
hippies thick.

RANDY
My God...

CARTMAN
In less than three days, all of South
Park will be completely consumed. My
only hope is to fight our way to the
center of the crowd, and reach the heart,
here.  If we can reach the stage, we
can upload this Slayer CD into their
music system.  Hippies can't stand death
metal. If everything works, they should
disperse just before they consume us
all.

JIMBO
Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant
flaw. That hippie crowd is massive!
How the hell are we supposed to get
through it and reach the stage?

CARTMAN
We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that
can bore its way through even the densest
hippie crowd. They pilots inside will
be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy
music outside.

STEVEN
Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody
drives right into the heart of that
mob?? It's a suicide mission!

CARTMAN
Not just somebody. I need a complete
team to operate this vehicle. Along
with me I'm gonna need a scientest,
an engineer, and of course, a black
person who can sacrifice himself in
case something goes wrong.

RANDY
I'm the... only scientist in town.


LINDA
I'm your engineer.

STEVEN
Honey, no!

LINDA
I have to do it, Steven.

CARTMAN
All right, then we just need a black
person who can sacrifice himself in
case something goes wrong.  Lessee,
anyone would do, anyone who meets the
qualifications, let's see...  Oh, I
know. How about-

CHEF
Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!

STEVEN
I I can't believe we're actually listening
to this. This is a crazy plan!

RANDY
You got a better ides, Steven?! Damnit,
my son is in there!

CARTMAN
There's no more time for ideas! We have
to have this vehicle up and operational
in less than three days! Look, it's
a long shot! But it's also the only
shot we-  got.

[The music festival, day 6. The camera pans across the site and
stops where the townsfolk stand around the vehicle]

[New report]

REPORTER
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado,
where a desparate attempt to save the
town is underway. Some call it a suicide
mission, but the heroic men and women
of the hippie digger may be our only
hope of survival.

RAMDU
Well I... guess this is it, Sharon.


SHARON
Please, save our boy, Randy.

LINDA
Butters, if anything happens to Mommy,
I, I want you to be a good boy.

BUTTERS
Ah I will, Mom.

CHEF
Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's
gonna be fine.

CARTMAN
I... don't want you to worry about me,
Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed
animal I've ever had.

KYLE'S MOTHER
Look out for yourselves!

MRS. GARRISON
Godspeed!

[Inside the digger]

CARTMAN
Primary engine running?

RANDY
Check.

CARTMAN
Navigation systems?

LINDA
Online

CARTMAN
Let's punch this baby.  We're coming
up on the outer perimeter of the hippies.
Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull
status?

RANDY
Vehicle shell holding!

[A command center nearby. Townsfolk mill around inside]

JIMBO
They're in!

TOWNSFOLK
All right! All right, yeah! We did it!


MAYOR MCDANIELS
All right, people, let's save it!
They still have a long way to go!


[The music festival. The boys are in front of the stage sitting
on throw rugs. They're bored.]

STAN
All right, I can't take it anymore!
I'm getting on that stage!

KYLE
You're doing what?

GUARD
Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo,
woo!

[Inside the digger]

CARTMAN
Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's
that?

RANDY
The drill is getting too hot from all
the hippies.

[The command center nearby. Townsfolk mill around inside]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
What's happened?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
They, they s- they stopped. Somethin's
wrong.

STEVEN
Jesus... they're dead in the water.


[The music festival. The digger is dead. Stan approaches the
mic]

STAN
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have
your attention please? What are we doing?
It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem
like we should accomplish something?


A HIPPIE
We're using the power of rock and roll
to change the world! Woo!

STAN
Maybe instead of complaining about corporations
being selfish, we should lookt at ourselves.
I mean, is there anything more selfish
than doing nothing but getting high
and listening to music all day long?


SINGER
He's right. It's time for all of us
to focus our energy and get this hippie
jam into full swing.

[Inside the digger, the crew tries to start it up again.]

CARTMAN
Come on, come on!

LINDA
It's useless. The main power line has
been shut down.

RANDY
Somebody's gonna have to go outside
and activate the backup boosters.


CARTMAN
No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out
there!

CHEF
...I didn't volunteer!

CARTMAN
...All right, fine Chef, go!

CHEF
...Aw damnit!

[The command center nearby. The Mayor takes command]

MAYOR MCDANIELS
That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke
the crowd!

STEVEN
Goddamnit no! Y-you have to give them
more time!

[The music festival. Chef makes his way through the crowd to
the booster switch and turns it on. The digger revs up and zooms
towards the stage. Kyle seems to be saying something, but what
it is we don't hear.]

STAN
Dude, these people have no idea what's
going on. Let's get out of here.

KYLE
We can't. Kenny just checked. There's
a wall of people like seven miles thick
behind us.

STAN
What?? You mean, we're stuck here listening
to this crap?

MAN 2
Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?


MAN 1
More tunes. More tunes!

LINDA
We made it, We made it!

CARTMAN
Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the
main line!

RANDY
Which cord is it?

CARTMAN
You're the scientist, jackass!

RANDY
I'm a geologist!

LINDA
We don't have time to argue! They're
gonna nuke us!

RANDY
Nyugh!

CARTMAN
Put them in my laptop!

A HIPPIE
Oh man, not cool.

HIPPIE 3
This music is so angry.

MAN 2
This is killing my buzz.

MAN 1
Let's bail on this whole angry scene.


RANDY
It's working!

LINDA
What?

RANDY
It's, it's working!

[The command center.]

MRS. GARRISON
We did it! We did it!

[The music festival. Stan sees his father]

STAN
Dad!

RANDY
Stan!

CHEF
I'm alive!

CARTMAN
Hold it right there, Kyle!

KYLE
Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies
anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us.


CARTMAN
Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger
plans for you now.

[South Park Elementary's parking lot. Kyle sits on the curb watching
Cartman play with his Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
Cartman has the scoop haul some rocks from one pile to another]


CARTMAN
Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!
Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with
it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't
get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!


THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 907


"ERECTION DAY"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
N'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know
it can sometimes be difficult to talk
about subjects like drugs and sex and
alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember,
last week I told you to write down any
difficult questions you had and put
them in this box anonymously so we could
discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot
o' responses, so let's read some aloud.
"Mr. Mackey is gay."  Okay kids, that
is not funny! Unkay?! This box is supposed
to be used for serious questions! About,
about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's
stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks
like a real one here.  "Dear Mr. Mackey,
you are gay."  All right, all right.
That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down
and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here
we go. Okay, "Mr. Mackey, sometimes
my parents hit me, and you are gay."
Damnit, is there not one serious question
in here?!  "Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey
is gay"  Okay, here.  I am a boy at
South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when
I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes
hard for no reason. What should I do?
All right kids, all right kids, that's
enough!  If you all can't be serious
about the question box,  then we'll
just do drug identification exercises,
unkay?!

CLASS
Awwwww!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come
up here and write down the names of
two narcotics?

JIMMY
Uh no, that that's okay, Mr. Mackey.


COUNSELOR MACKEY
Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling
you!

JIMMY
Uhhh, just uh uh ahh not right this
second, Mr. Mackey.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well why the hell not?!

JIMMY
Uh...

COUNSELOR MACKEY
He's what... Oh, you do? R r right now,
right now it is? on'kay, on'kay. Don't
worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick
someone else, um. Eric, why don't you
come up here?

CARTMAN
Hey, that's bullcrap?! How come Jimmy
doesn't have to do it?!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching
a tent right now.

STAN
He's what??

[South Park Elementary hallway. Kids milling around notice a
poster on the pegboard among the lockers and talk amongst themselves.]


STAN
A hundred dollar gift certificate to
South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do
the talent show.

KYLE
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always
wins with his stand-up comedy.

JIMMY
Hey fellas.

STAN
Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving
away a hundred dollar first prize for
the talent show.

JIMMY
Oh I sure have. I've been working on
my ruh... ruh,,, routine all year long


KYLE
I don't know how you do it, dude. How
do you get up in front of that many
people?

JIMMY
Well fellas, entertainment is my life.
I love being in front of everyone.
Aaah!

KYLE
Huh wuh, what's the matter?

JIMMY
I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas.
Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh,
cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please.

CRAIG
It's occupied.

CARTMAN
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.

BUTTERS
Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that
first prize for the talent show? Why
you must be excited! You'll probably
win like always.

JIMMY
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL escited...
for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's
wrong with me?

BUTTERS
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?!
How about a courtesy flush?!

CARTMAN
Up yours, Butters.

[Jimmy's house, afternoon. Jimmy walks through the door and sighs.
His parents are on the sofa. His mom reads a book, his dad a
newspaper]

SARAH
Hey Jimmy, how was school?

JIMMY
Fine, Mom.

RYAN
Jimmy, we understand you're getting
erections in the classroom.

JIMMY
What? Uh who told you that?

RYAN
Mr. Mackey, your counselor.

JIMMY
Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!

RYAN
Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed
of. But we know it's something you might
have a hard time talking about. Get
it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's
advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help
us all talk about this.

JIMMY
Dz-n-Doctor Pal?

DOCTOR PAL
Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because
I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal.
Are we cool?

JIMMY
Uh, sure?

DOCTOR PAL
A lot of times parents call me in because
I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm
down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand
you have some concerns about erections.
"Oops, can't say erection in front
of the parents right. Oh God, I feel
so weird" huh?

JIMMY
Well, a little, yes.

DOCTOR PAL
Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random
erections. Almost every boy goes through
a phase where his penis becomes hard...
for no particular reason. It's just
part of grwoing up. Growing up? Growing
out is more like it.

JIMMY
But I have to make it stop! The talent
show is this F-Friday.

DOCTOR PAL
Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't
you skidaddle for a tick and let us
hipsters talk in privo.

RYAN
A-all right, come on, honey.

DOCTOR PAL
Jimmy, as you get older your body goes
through a lot of changes. Certain hormones
start to release as your whole reproductive
system begins to awaken, and so, if
you like, we can take off our shirts
and kiss.

JIMMY
Ke...c-come again?

DOCTOR PAL
Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that
set you off on a different tangent,
got you thinkin' a different way. That's
what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless,
of course, you think we should take
off our shirts and kiss.

JIMMY
N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt
and kiss

DOCTOR PAL
Well then to hell with you, kid. You
can just deal with your problems on
your own.

[Jimmy's house, night. He's fast asleep, and we see his dream]


ANNOUNCER
Next up for the talent show, put your
hands together for the incredibly talented
Jimmy Valmer!

JIMMY
Wow, what a what a great audience. So
apparently Martha Stewart is out of
jail. Have you have you heard about
this, have you seen this? She's very
excited to get started on her new show,
"Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic
ankle bracelet."  So it looks like the
Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope.
Have you seen this, have you heard about
this?  A-a-apparently they're going
to call him New Pope, a-and refer to
John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,..
so it so it looks like Michael Jackson
is having back problem in court.  You
know... huh... you uh you know what
they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.
Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.
What a fantastic audience.

MRS. GARRISON
Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing
with you, we're laughing AT you.


JIMMY
Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh!

[Butters' house, day. He's practicing his favorite song in the
garage with some help from his boom box. Jimmy approaches]


BUTTERS
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu
Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's
get together, I know what we can do,
Lu Lu.

JIMMY
Butters!

BUTTERS
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin'
for the talent show.

JIMMY
Butters, ah I really need to talk to
somebody, and I think maybe you're the
only person who won't make f-f-fun of
me.

BUTTERS
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody
with a problem.

JIMMY
Butters, do you know what you're supposed
to do when your penis gets hard?

BUTTERS
Well sure I do.

JIMMY
Really??

BUTTERS
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should
have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy,
when a man's penis becomes hard, the
man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."
Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside
the lady's tummy, and after it's all
done sneezin' milk.thepenis stops bein'
hard, and the man loses interest in
the lady.

JIMMY
So, when your penis becomes hard, you're
supposed to put in in a lady's vagina.
And then it stops being hard?

BUTTERS
That's right, Jimmy.

JIMMY
But where am I going to find a lady
to stick my penis in? The talent show
is this Friday.

[South Park Elementary, day. The kids visit their lockers to
change books.]

GIRL
Talk to you, Bertha.

BERTHA
Okay, see you later, Jessie.

JIMMY
Hey Bertha.

BERTHA
Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on?

JIMMY
Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could
stick my penis in your vagina?

BERTHA
What?? No way!

JIMMY
But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo!


BERTHA
Jerk!

CARTMAN
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you
doing, man?

JIMMY
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look
like?

CARTMAN
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl
and ask her if you can stick your penis
in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her
on a date, take her out for some Italian
food.

JIMMY
Wow, seems like you know a lot about
this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid
before?

CARTMAN
Sure, lots of times. I've been laid,
like, five thousand times.

JIMMY
Well, wha-what do I do?

CARTMAN
I told you: a date and then Italian
food. And then you gotta make her thnk
you're a good listener.

JIMMY
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's
very important that I score to-night!
Can you come on the date and help me?
You're like a white... Hitch.

CARTMAN
Why sure, they do this all the time
in movies and TV shows. You go on the
date and wear an earpiece, and I'll
be nearby, secretly telling you all
the right things to say.

JIMMY
Wow! Thanks, Eric.

[A house, night. A woman is reading a book on her sofa. The doorbell
rings.]

MOM
Shawna honey, I think your little date
is here.

SHAWNA
Okay, Mom.

JIMMY
Hey Shawna.

SHAWNA
Hi Jimmy.

CARTMAN
Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how
good she looks.

JIMMY
Wow, Shawna, you look fantastic.

SHAWNA
Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?


JIMMY
We're going to an authentic Italian
restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini

[Buca de Fagghecini, dinnertime. Jimmy and Shawna wait for service
at their table]

WAITER
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the
authentico experience Italiano. My name
is Roma. Can I start you out with some
lotsa pasta macaroni minis?

JIMMY
Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic
pizzareli casserona poppers

WAITER
Right away.

SHAWNA
You know that girl Sally Rauman at our
school? I can't stand her.

CARTMAN
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what
she's saying now isn't interesting at
all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting.
Please tell me more."

JIMMY
Wow, that is very interesting. Please
tell me more.

SHAWNA
Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same
purse and I was like, "No WAY do I want
it now!" because who wants a purse that
both their best friends have, right?
And so-

CARTMAN
All right, when she stops yappin' again,
say "Wow, I've never thought of it that
way before, but you're right."

SHAWNA
-I guess that's why I figured, "Who
needs friends like that?"

JIMMY
Wow, I've never thought of it that way
before, but you're right.

SHAWNA
It's like I told Debbie: "If you're
gonna go out with my friends-"

CARTMAN
All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts
her trap again, I want you to repeat
whatever she said, and then follow it
with "Wow, how insightful."

SHAWNA
"And so if you're gonna be that way,
I don't need to be your friend."

JIMMY
"if you're gonna be that way, I don't
need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.


SHAWNA
You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.


JIMMY
Really?

SHAWNA
Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate
like you do.

JIMMY
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna,
because I really wanna stick my penis
in your vagina.

CARTMAN
Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.

SHAWNA
...What???  I'm not doing that!

JIMMY
But the talent show is tomorrow night!


SHAWNA
Creep!

CARTMAN
Aaagh!

[South Park Elementary, next evening. The gym is set up for the
talent show and the whole school is there. Well, most of the
school...]

MRS. GARRISON
Welcome students and parents to the
annual South Park Elementary Talent
Show!  We have a lot of little talneted
performers to get through, so the quicker
you shut up, the quicker this will be
over!  Okay, first up we have Billy
Turner, from the third grade, who will
be doing an alto sax solo.

[South Park Elementary, out on the front curb. Jimmy sits there
subbing. Officer Barbrady's police car rolls gently towards him
and stops. The driver door opens and Officer Barbrady comes into
view.]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?

JIMMY
Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh
b-Barbrady.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Jimmy, what are you doing here? The
talent show is inside.

JIMMY
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent
show.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Not perform? But Jimmy, you love talent
shows. Everyone in town knows that.


JIMMY
I just c-can't risk getting up in front
of everyone.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Why?

JIMMY
All right! I I keep getting an erection
for no reason! Okay! But I can't get
any of the girls here to let me... do
it to them.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well of course not, Jimmy. LIttle girls
don't wanna have sex.

JIMMY
Then why does God make it so that my
penis gets hard if girls don't wanna
have it in their vaginas? It's like
a cruel joke.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young
and pure. They're not like the ladies
down at Colfax Point.

JIMMY
...Colfax Point?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well yeah, those women will have sex
with anybody.

JIMMY
Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus
...and get down there before the talent
show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!


OFFICER BARBRADY
You're welcome, Jim.  Wait...

[Colfax Point, in the red-light district of town, night. Cars
roll by as obese prostitutes try to get customers. Shapely prostitutes
try as well when the obese ones are denied. A black women wearing
knee-high boots walks down the street towards the camera. She
has brilliant red hair, black vest and boots, and cheetah-print
shorts]

VOICE-OVER
Colfax Point.

Pimps and hos and tricks in rows

Women walk the street with corns on their feet

Broken dreams and no ice creams

[a car stops in front of a woman built like a brick mansion]


HO
You lookin' for a date?

JIMMY
Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis
in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse
me, ma'am. What's your name?

PROSTITUTE
They call me Nut Gobbler.

JIMMY
Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.


NUT GOBBLER
Huh??

JIMMY
I have a raging hard-on that just won't
quit, and the talent show has already
started.

NUT GOBBLER
You a cop?

JIMMY
No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic.


NUT GOBBLER
You got money?

JIMMY
Sure do.

NUT GOBBLER
All right, you got a place to go?

JIMMY
Sure. I know the p-perfect place.

[Buca de Fagghecini, moments later. The waitier arrives]

ROMA
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the
authentic experienso Italiano. My name
is Roma, and uhhh  Oh, it's so nice
to see you again, Mr. Valmer.

JIMMY
Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't
want them to know I was here with a
different girl.

ROMA
Oh right, pardone, segnore. I'll come
back with some garlic bread mediterraneane.


NUT GOBBLER
What are we doin' anyway?

JIMMY
This is authentic Italian food straight
from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa
Mozzarella Pizza Roll.

NUT GOBBLER
I can't eat too much, I'lve got an infected
urinary tract. I've been pissin' blood
for a week.

JIMMY
Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting.
Please tell me more.

NUT GOBBLER
Huh?  Well, that's it, I just pissed
blood! So I have to stick a tampon up
my peehole.

JIMMY
Wow. You know, I've never thought of
it that way before, but you're right.
If you're pissing blood, you can shuve
a tampon up your peehole. You are very
insightful. Please tell me more.

NUT GOBBLER
Look, kid, what are you doin'?! You
wanna get laid or not?

JIMMY
Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's
why I'm taking you to this ...fancy
place and pretending to be interested
in what you have to say..

NUT GOBBLER
Kid, I'm a hooker. You don't have to
take me to dinner OR be nice to me.


JIMMY
What? Fo, for real?

NUT GOBBLER
You paid me, so you get to do me. It's
that simple.

JIMMY
Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting
our time here for then? The talent show
is happening right now! Let's get to
r-r-rammin'!

PIMP
What are you doin', ho?! Havin' dinner?!
You're supposed to be workin' for me!


NUT GOBBLER
It's where the trick wanted to go, you
bastard!

PIMP
Trick?! I ain't stupid! Ain't no trick
gonna take you out to dinner!  This
PIMP is tryin' to steal you away from
me!  This is MY ho!

JIMMY
I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid
for her and took her out to dinner.
She's my ho!

NUT GOBBLER
Uh Jesus.

PIMP
You got a problem, bitch?!

JIMMY
Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter
of fact! I've spent all my money on
this ho, and she's now my only shot
at getting laid, and the talent show
is only a couple of hours from being
over.

PIMP
You're comin' home right now!

NUT GOBBLER
Agh! Let go of my hair, you son of a
bitch!

JIMMY
Sir, sir, that is my ho!

PIMP
I'm gonna kick your ass, ho!

JIMMY
Sir, sir!

[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. A student
sings Journey's "Open Arms" badly]

STAN
Woof.

[Buca de Fagghecini, outside. The pimp drives off with Nut Gobbler,
and Jimmy just steps out the front doors]

JIMMY
Son of a ...b-bitch!  Taxi!  Follow
that pimp and ho!

[The pimp's car]

NUT GOBBLER
Where are you taking me?!

PIMP
I'm gonna kill you, ho!

NUT GOBBLER
No! Please! Chewmoney! I'm sorry!

CHEWMONEY
You're already dead, ho!

JIMMY
Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking
her, you are no better than a common
th-thief!

CHEWMONEY
Fuck you, punk!

JIMMY
Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch!


CHEWMONEY
Get your ass back in here, ho!

NUT GOBBLER
Aaaah!

JIMMY
I got you, Nut Gobbler!

[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. The Goth
kids are now onstage. The Red Goth and Henrietta are on guitars,
and the Kindergarten Goth is on drums. The Tall Goth sings]


TALL GOTH
No no nono no, I'm not gonna be in the
talent show.

Oh no no nono no. I'll never be in your faggy talent show. [the
song ends and they walk offstage. Some applause for them comes
up from the audience]

MRS. GARRISON
Okay, that was the Goth kids with "Talent
Shows Are For Fags"

TALL GOTH
That was killer. We showed them.

RED GOTH
Yeah, I hope we win.

[The streets of South Park, night. The two cars are still racing
down the streets with Nut Gobbler splits between them. She's
screaming from the pain]

JIMMY
Come on, ho!

CABBIE
Look out!

MOTORCYCLIST
Daww?

NUT GOBBLER
Aah??  NO!

JIMMY
Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up!


[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. A magic
act ends as the assistant steps out of a box]

KID MAGICIAN
Tada!

MRS. GARRISON
Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very
nice.  Our next act is Butters, who
will be singing a song

STEPHEN
There's our boy.

BUTTERS
Lu lu lu, I'vw got some... some... uh,
some uh... some, uh... uuuhhh... Oh
no!  No no noho noo!

MRS. GARRISON
Okay, thank you Butters, very nice,
short and sweet.

[The streets of South Park, night. The two cars are now bumping
each other off.]

CHEWMONEY
Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up!


JIMMY
Get close to him!  How much do I owe
you?

CABBIE
Six dollars and twenty-four cents.


JIMMY
C-can I just get two back, please?


CABBIE
Oh, thank you very much.  There you
go. Have a good 'n.

JIMMY
Thank you.

CHEWMONEY
You're gonna pay for this, bitch!

NUT GOBBLER
No! Heelllp!!  Haaaaaaaaaa!!

JIMMY
Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!
Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is
embarassing.

[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. A magic
act ends as the assistant steps out of a box]

MRS. GARRISON
And now we have Eric Cartman, who will
be doing select readings from the movie,
Scarface.

CARTMAN
D'you know what you are? You're all
a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You
need people like me! You need people
like me so you can point your fucking
finger and say "That's the bad guy!"
Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!


LIANE
That's my little boy.

[Colfax Point, night. On the rooftop of the building, Chewmoney
has Nut Gobbler on her knees and is ready to shoot her dead.]


NUT GOBBLER
Please, Chewmoney! Don't do this!

CHEWMONEY
I told you never to turn on me, ho!


JIMMY
Hey, j-j-jackass!  I'm sorry I resorted
to calling you jackass just now, but
I'm very upset!

CHEWMONEY
And what are you gonna do, huh?! I've
got four feet on you AND a gun! What
do you have?!

JIMMY
What do I have? The weapon of comedy.
So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese
aren't getting along lately. Have you
seen this? Have you heard about this?


CHEWMONEY
What?!

JIMMY
I'll tell you one thing: their food
hasn't been getting along with my stomach
for years.

CHEWMONEY
That's pretty good.

JIMMY
Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have
you seen this? Have you heard about
this?

CHEWMONEY
Oh yeah. That's right, she is.

JIMMY
She's apparently gotten real good with
baking cakes with keys in them.

NUT GOBBLER
Serves you right, you son of a bitch!


JIMMY
Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler.

GOBBLER
I can't believe you chased me all this
way. You, you really care about me.


JIMMY
Not really. You're just a hooker, and
I need to get laid. The talent show
could be over any minute.

GOBBLER
That's good enough for me.  Take me
to bed.

[South Park Elementary Talent Show, now in progress. Ike is onstage
singing "Yankee Doodle Boy"]

IKE
I have a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,


She's my Yankee Doodle girl.

[holds up some sparklers]

'Ankee Doodle came to London,

Just to ride the ponies,

[throws them off and gets inside a small cannon next to him.
The barrel rises until it's in launch pisition]

I am da Yankee Doodle

I am da Yankee Doodle

I am da Yankee Doodle boy.

[The cannon shoots him out and he lands clear across the stage.
Some applause greets the performance. As the props are taken
away, Ike takes off his hat and bows low to everyone, then puts
on his top hat and walks off]

MRS. GARRISON
Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All
right, children, it looks like we have
no more contestants, which means, the
Talent Show is over!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Mackey, it's over.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Huh?  Oh oh oh, right.

MRS. GARRISON
Now we will tally up the judges' scores
and find out which act they hated the
least.

JIMMY
Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if
you don't mind, I'll be taking that
microphone..


Okay, let's put our hands together for
Jimmy Valmer.


Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently
it's been exactly two years since the
fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this?
Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush
predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell,
Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't
fall was ...the price of gas.  I just
read in the paper that China's protesting
Japan. Have you seen this? Have you
heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China
you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding
me.

"THE TOOTH FAIRY'S TATS 2000"


Written by


Trey Parker,  Matt Stone,  Nancy Pimental





[The Cartman house. Liane is sipping her coffee on the sofa.
She lowers it as Cartman screams]

CARTMAN
Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something
wonderful has happened!

LIANE
What is it, snookums?

CARTMAN
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a
tooth under my pillow, and she gave
me two dollars!  She's only given me
a lousy quarter before!

LIANE
Oh my! She must think that you are a
very special little muffin.

CARTMAN
Yeah! This is so tits!

LIANE
Don't say "tits," Eric.

CARTMAN
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!

LIANE
Well, then, now you should take that
money and open up a savings account
that has compounded daily interest.


CARTMAN
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with
interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy
store and buy me a skateboard!

LIANE
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy
wants you to use that money to learn
about saving.

CARTMAN
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy
wants me to do with this money, okay?
You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see
you later!  Aw, man, this is so tits!


[The bus stop. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand around]

CARTMAN
Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe
this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!
Just wait until you hear this, you
guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't
you stoked?!

STAN
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!


KYLE
He's fat and he's stupid?

CARTMAN
Look what the tooth fairy left me last
night!

STAN
Two dollars!

KYLE
No way!

STAN
For one tooth?

CARTMAN
For one tooth.

STAN
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only
got a quarter.

KYLE
I only got a jar of gifelte fish.

CARTMAN
Well, that doesn't matter, because I
have an idea that is totally tits.


KYLE
...Totally what?

CARTMAN
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's
being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot
for me. I don't know, but if we all
chip in with teeth, then I can hide
them under my pillow and we could get
enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.


STAN, KYLE, KENNY
Sega Dreamcast??

CARTMAN
All we need is teeth.

STAN
I already lost all my baby teeth.

KYLE
Me too.

KENNY
(Nuh-uh.)

KYLE
You still have baby teeth, Kenny?

KENNY
(No way!)

CARTMAN
Kenny, think about it. Don't you want
a  Sega Dreamcast?

KENNY
(No I don't! Thank you.)

CARTMAN
Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!


[The school yard. Stan ties Kenny to a tetherball pole. The string
leads off to the right]

STAN
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's
tooth. You ready over there?

KYLE
Almost. You ready, Timmy?

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

KYLE
When I say "go," you slam your electric
wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?


TIMMY
Timmiihh!

KYLE
Right. You're Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!

KENNY
(Why the fuck does it have to be my
tooth?)

CARTMAN
I'll tell you why it has to be you,
Kenny: because your family is poor,
and therefore has bad oral hygiene,
so your teeth are gonna fall out someday,
anyway. If you think about it, you should
actually be thanking us.  "Oh, thank
you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.


KENNY
(Fuck you!)

KYLE
Alright! Get ready, Timmy.

TIMMY
Timmiihh!

BUTTERS
Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?


STAN
What does it look like we're doing,
Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using
Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of
Kenny's.

BUTTERS
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here.


STAN, CARTMAN
You what?

KENNY
(You what?)

TIMMY
Timmih-

BUTTERS
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two
hours ago.

STAN
Uh, Butters, could we have it?

BUTTERS
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it.
Why, I'm gonna stick it under- my pillow
and get money from the tooth fairy.
She gives me fifty cents a tooth.


TIMMY
Ha-a-ugh.

BUTTERS
Well, uh, see ya, fellas.

KYLE
Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a
tooth out of Kenny's mouth.

STAN
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.


KENNY
(Woohoo!)

CARTMAN
How are we gonna get it from him?

STAN
I guess we'll have to sneak into his
house after he goes to sleep tonight.


KYLE
Yeah, let's go.

TIMMY
Go! Timmy go!  Yeah, Timmy!

KYLE
No, Timmy, wait!

TIMMY
Engh go uh Timmy!

KENNY
(Hey, guys!)  (Heey-ungh)  (Oowww.)


CARTMAN
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see
Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.

TIMMY
Hu-aah!

[A house, night. Butters is asleep in his room. A pole rises
outside with a grinning Cartman dressed as a tooth fairy dangling
from it]

CARTMAN
Higher, you guys.

STAN
Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat
guy to lift up in there?

CARTMAN
Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the
left, you guys, left.  No, camera left,
camera left!  That's it, now down.


BUTTERS
What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!


CARTMAN
I am the tooth fairy, my child.

BUTTERS
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean
to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now,
see?

CARTMAN
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under
your pillow.

BUTTERS
Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd
be so fat.

CARTMAN
Ey!

KYLE
Come on, fatass!

CARTMAN
Do not open your eyes until morning.
Or else I will kick you in the nuts.
Square in the nuts.

BUTTERS
Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!

STAN
Well?

CARTMAN
Bull's eye!

[Cartman's house, later. He's being tucked in bed]

LIANE
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time
of the night.

CARTMAN
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.


LIANE
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat.
I have to work tonight.

CARTMAN
Okay.

LIANE
Good night.  What do you have there,
Eric?

CARTMAN
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin'
it for the tooth fairy.

LIANE
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to
give you a big surprise for losing two
teeth in two days.

CARTMAN
I know, huh?

[The bus stop, next morning. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are there]


CARTMAN
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're
not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational
thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys!
I mean-

KYLE
Did the tooth fairy come?

CARTMAN
Four dollars.

STAN
Oh my God!

KYLE
Four dollars?

KENNY
(Oh, my God!)

CARTMAN
Do you what this means?

STAN
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth
and putting them under your pillow.


[Dentist office, some days later. A phone rings]

A DENTIST
Dentist office.

LIANE
Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms.
Cartman.

DR. ROBERTS
Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do
for you?

LIANE
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of
his baby teeth, and I was starting to
get worried.

DR. ROBERTS
Well, losing baby teeth is a natural
thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he
lost?

LIANE
About a hundred and twelve.

DR. ROBERTS
...A hundred and twelve.

LIANE
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps
he should switch toothpaste?

DR. ROBERTS
Your son wouldn't happen to be an "alligator,"
would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid
I can't help you right now. The American
Dental Association convention is this
week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll
look into it.

LIANE
O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week.


DR. ROBERTS
What?

[Cartman's room, dawn. He rises and throws his pillows off the
bed]

CARTMAN
Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!

LIANE
Yes, Eric

CARTMAN
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to
bring me money last night! Call the
police!

LIANE
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has
something to tell you. It's just that-
well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric.
I've been putting all that money under
your pillow, and because you got so
many teeth fall out, I've actually run
out of money and can't go to the grocery
store for at least a month.

CARTMAN
You almost had me for a second there,
Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy."
I suppose you're gonna tell me there's
no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus,
either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?

LIANE
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out
sooner or later.

CARTMAN
Yi- you're serious here. There really
is no tooth fairy?

LIANE
No, honey. It's just-

CARTMAN
How could-? How could you lie to me,
Mother? Lie right to my face?

LIANE
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a
child.

CARTMAN
How can I trust you?  How can I trust
anyone ever again, Mother? I guess,
uh to make it through this life, I can
only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins
Bear, of course.

LIANE
Eric! Eric, wait!

CARTMAN
No, Mother! No more lies!

[The Cartman house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait. Cartman exits
and walks down the street upset, ignoring his friends]

STAN
Dude, where's the money?

CARTMAN
There is no money.

KYLE
No more money??

STAN
What are you talking about, Cartman?!
We're only $167 away from gettin' a
Sega!

CARTMAN
I know!

KYLE
Cartman, what's going on?!

CARTMAN
You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know
how to tell you this.

STAN
Tell us what?!

CARTMAN
You guys, there's... there's no tooth
fairy, you guys. There, I said it.


KYLE
What do you mean, "there's no tooth
fairy?"

CARTMAN
My mom has been giving me the money
all this time, and your parents are
the ones who left you money.

STAN
Dude.

KYLE
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie
to me.

CARTMAN
But now my mom has given us so much
money that she's bankrupt, and we're
poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny.


KYLE
You're wrong. If my dad says something
is real, then it's real!

CARTMAN
Kyle, open your eyes, man!

KYLE
It's not true!

[The Broflovski house. Kyle enters the living room. Gerald is
on the sofa reading the newspaper]

KYLE'S FATHER
Oh, hello, son.

KYLE
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?


KYLE'S FATHER
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little
talk.

KYLE
Oh my God! You did lie to me.

KYLE'S FATHER
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like
Peter Pan.

KYLE
Peter Pan, too??

KYLE'S FATHER
Kyle...

KYLE
What about Moses and Abraham?

KYLE'S FATHER
Well, they were probably real.

KYLE
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??

KYLE'S FATHER
Probably not.

KYLE
Wahahahah!

KYLE'S FATHER
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things
because they're fun for children.


KYLE
Fun for children?! Fun for children?!
Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's
real anymore! Weaaaah!

[The town. The boys less Stan sit at a curb moping]

CARTMAN
Man, I can't believe all our parents
lied to us about the tooth fairy.


KYLE
What about Dan Rather? Do you think
he's real?

CARTMAN
No, man, that's just a TV show.

STAN
You guys! You guys! I figured it out!


CARTMAN
What? That your parents lied to you,
too?

STAN
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get
our Sega Dreamcast!

CARTMAN
How?

STAN
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up,
right?

KYLE
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.


STAN
So all we have to do is go to a really
rich kid's house, put our tooth under
his pillow, wait for his parents to
leave him a whole buttload of money,
and then sneak back in and take it!


KENNY
(Woohoo!)

STAN
The kid will never even know.

CARTMAN
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that
is big fat Oprah tits right there!


KYLE
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?

STAN
We can take the bus to the city. There's
super-rich people down there!

CARTMAN
Yeah.

KYLE
I mean, what if I'm just part of my
parents' reality?

STAN
Come on, Kyle!

KYLE
What if this is all just somebody's
dream?

[Cherry Creek, the wealthiest neighborhood in Colorado, night.
The bus pulls up to a curb and drops the boys off in front of
a three-story mansion]

CARTMAN
Wow, look at the size of these houses!


STAN
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest
part of Denver. I'll bet these kids
get at least ten bucks a tooth from
the  "Tooth Fairy."

CARTMAN
Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's
obviously kids living there.

STAN
There. You can tell this is the kid's
window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers
on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's
room, leave the tooth under the pillow,
then come back out. We'll wait for the
parents to see it and leave money, then
swing you back in the house to grab
it.

CARTMAN
Got it.

STAN
This is the smartest business venture
ever.

CARTMAN
What the-?

STAN
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!


BOY 1
We're gonna sneak a tooth under this
rich kid's pillow, then come back and
collect the tooth fairy money that his
parents leave him.

STAN
...Hey, you can't do that!

BOY 2
Why not?!

STAN
Because that's what we're doing!

CARTMAN
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!

BOY 2
What the hell are you talking about?!
We've been doing this for over two years!


KYLE
Two years?

BLOND
Nice tooth fairy costume. You think
anybody'd believe you in that?!

CARTMAN
It's better than your dress! You look
like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!


BLOND
How dare you!

BOY 1
Look, this is our turf! You'd better
scram before the Boss breaks your legs!


STAN
You scram! We were here first!

RICH KID
What's going on?  Oh! It's the tooth
fairies!

BOY 2
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up!


STAN
You woke him up!

RICH KID
I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies
but I have been a very good boy.

ALL
Shut up!

BOY 1
Alright, that does it! Come on, we're
going to see the Boss!

STAN
Who's the Boss?

BOY 1
Loogie.

[Loogie's Ristorante. The light above the door is the one that
flickers]

LOOGIE
My associates here tell me you were
working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that
true?

STAN
Uuh, yeah.

BOY 1
Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever
seen that kind of disre-  Erp.

CARTMAN
We were there first!

LOOGIE
Kids have been doing the tooth fairy
racket in this town for years.  I do
it just like my big brother before me,
and my oldest brother before that.


STAN
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!


LOOGIE
Let me ask you something: You were gonna
sneak a tooth under this rich kid's
pillow? Then what?

STAN
Well, uh-what do you mean?

LOOGIE
How are the kid's parents gonna know
there was a tooth under their child's
pillow?

BOY 1
Ha! You guys don't even know how the
tooth trade works!

STAN
What's a "tooth trade?"

LOOGIE
Look, any shmuck can sneak through a
window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth
racket is much more involved.  We keep
careful track of what houses we've hit
so that we don't hit the same one twice
in less than two months.  Inside the
house we not only have to sneak a tooth
under the pillow, but leave a note for
Mom and Dad to see.

DEAR

TOOTHFAIRY,


I LOST A TOOTH!


I PUT IT UNDER


MY PILLOW!

This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the
pillow. [the fairies ride through the neighborhood on their bikes]
Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over,
going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to
do is collect money. [shots of the tooth fairies cleaning up]
And the kids never know what hit 'em.

THE SOUTH PARK BOYS
Wow!

LOOGIE
The hardest part is getting teeth. We
tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey
games , anywhere we can find them


BEAT-UP BOY
Nooo!

LOOGIE
The teeth we do manage to acquire are
then sorted according to size, color,
and quality.  But there's never enough
teeth. Never enough.

STAN
Amazing.

CARTMAN
Man, that is tits!

LOOGIE
And now my only problem is, what do
I do with you?

BOY 1
Rowwr!

LOOGIE
Tell you what: how would you like to
run the South Park tooth racket for
me?

STAN
Oh. Uh-I don't know.

LOOGIE
It's that, or else I can cut off your
penises.

CARTMAN
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut
off. Work for you, have my penis cut
off. Hm's see...

KYLE
Cartman!

STAN
How much do we get if we work for you?


LOOGIE
I'll cut you in at 2%.

CARTMAN
Two percent, have my penis cut off.
Two percent-

STAN
We're in!

[American Dental Association, a gleaming skyscraper, day. Then
the interior is shown, with all the dentists assembled. Dr. Roberts
speaks]

DR. ROBERTS
Fellow dentists: As you all know, we
are still having numerous reports of
missing teeth from all over the country.
There are also reports of missing tooth
fairy money. We believe that there can
be only one logical reason for all of
this.  A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel
that steals either teeth or money from
children as they sleep in order to build
some kind of giant nest  for its genetically
superior and potentially dangerous offspring!
We believe also that this creature would
have at least a mild understanding of
algebra , and that it-

DENTIST
Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more
logical theory.

DR. ROBERTS
...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley,
enlighten us!

MR. FOLEY
I think what we've got here is some
kind of black-market tooth racket. Something
where one group is stealing the money
and teeth from another group for a profit.


DR. ROBERTS
Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous
that sounds.

MR. FOLEY
It's not ridiculous. It's very possible.
I've seen it happen before.

DR. ROBERTS
Where?!

MR. FOLEY
In Montreal.

DR. ROBERTS
And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?!


MR. FOLEY
Look, I know how to handle this. All
we have to do is bring down the kingpin
and the rest will fall. You'll see!
I'll have it taken care of in a matter
of weeks!

DR. ROBERTS
Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you
go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile,
we'll deal with the real problems at
hand.

MR. FOLEY
Well, I will!

DR. ROBERTS
Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel
would most likely be about three to
four-and-a-half feet tall. His large
beak is probably detachable, and works
as a flotation device.

[South Park Elementary, day. Lunchtime in the cafeteria]

BOY
Here! Here, over here, look! Look what
I got- I got from the chef!

CHEF
Hello there, children.

THE BOYS
Hey, Chef.

STAN
We all want double-desserts today!


CHEF
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school
charges extra for that.

CARTMAN
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a
thang.

CHEF
Oh my God! There has got to be at least
fifteen dollars here!

CARTMAN
That's right. Keep the change, my man.


CHEF
Well! Look at you cute little crackers!
With your money and your fancy clothes
and your cell phones, it's almost like
you were-  Oh my God, children! What
have I told you about drugs?!

THE BOYS
That there's a time and a place for
everything, and it's called "college."


CHEF
That's right. And the only thing worse
than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm
gonna tell you about when I was your
age and got offered drugs.

LITTLE CHEF
Ooo, come on, now.

KID 1
Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?


GIRL
What?

KID 1
Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?


LITTLE CHEF
Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me
sing you a little song:


I can't wait until I grow up

and my weenie get and strong

'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust

And make love to Amanda all night long

I'm gonna make love to Amanda in about ten years!

KID 3
What?

KID 2
What the hell is he talking about?


LITTLE CHEF
And that toothpick is gonna turn into
an oak tree,...

STAN
U-uh, Chef.

LITTLE CHEF
I'ma knock you down, knock you up,...


STAN
Chef!

LITTLE CHEF
...knock you over, and knock you all around.


STAN
CHEF!

CHEF
Uh?

STAN
We're not dealing drugs!

CHEF
You're not?

STAN
No!

CHEF
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're
doin', just remember this: havin' money
may seem fun, but...  Ooh, uh-oh, never
mind.

THE BOYS
Thanks, Chef.

KYLE
See ya.

CHEF
Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm
gonna look her up.

[The boys return to the cafeteria with their food]

STAN
Dude, having this much money is great!
Working for Loogie rules!

CARTMAN
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie?
We know how the trade works: why don't
we do it ourselves and keep all the
profit?

STAN
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will
kick our asses.

CARTMAN
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack
gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I
say we create our own mob crime family!


KYLE
Dude, this book says there could be
infinite alternate realities to every
reality.

CARTMAN
Sure, Kyle.

[Loogie's restaurant, night. Loogie's talking to someone on his
cell phone at table]

LOOGIE
They're what?! They're not gonna pay
me? Who the hell do they think they
are? I want those South Park kids dead!
I want their families dead! I want their
houses burned to the ground!  Oh, hi
there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are
out front, if you need 'em.

MR. FOLEY
Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is
Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental
Association.

LOOGIE
Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some
spaghetti?

MR. FOLEY
No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted
to let you know that I'm onto you.


LOOGIE
I told the ADA a thousand times: I know
nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old
boy who likes climbing trees and playing
in puddles.

MR. FOLEY
I am going to find out who the boss
is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his
ass and everyone's ass who helped hide
his ass!

[Cartman's house, day, living room. He is seated behind a desk
talking to a boy]

CARTMAN
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth
from China.

ODD BOY
That's right, yeah  . It's all top-grade
stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling
their teeth for peanuts, see?

CARTMAN
How much?

ODD BOY
Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but
I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha,
buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh?


CARTMAN
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?

WEASEL
Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.

CARTMAN
Do you think I'm an idiot?

WEASEL
Huh?

CARTMAN
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch!
You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat
teeth?!  Get out of my sight!  Lousy
little scum!  What?!

BOY 2
This is your last chance, kid! Either
you give the boss his cut, or else we're
gonna throw your pal into the river
wearing concrete galoshes!

CARTMAN
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not
afraid of you!

KYLE
Oh my God, this book says that negative
and positive are the same thing; that
real and not real are one.

[The river. Boy 2 hangs up]

BOY 2
He's not gonna do it?!

KENNY
(He's not gonna do it?!)

BOY 2
He's not gonna do it, boss!

LOOGIE
Well then, throw him in.

BOY 1
Alright, kid. Time to die.

KENNY
(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!)


BOY 2
Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?


[News report, night]

ANCHOR
...to which Ms. Clinton replied, "I don't
even like Vagina." Finally tonight,
a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is
live.

DAN AKAWA
Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house
of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy
is in desperate need of a bone-marrow
transplant  or he will most certainly
die.  Billy, how much more money do
you need for the transplant?

BILLY
Sih, six hundred dollar-.

DAN AKAWA
Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!

BILLY
Duh six hundred dohollars.

DAN AKAWA
Well, that's a lot of money.How the
hell are you gonna get all that in the
short amount of time you have left?


BILLY
Well, I a-I don't know.

DAN AKAWA
Well, Billy, I also understand that
you lost a tooth today.

BILLY
Yehahah.

DAN AKAWA
Billy, we want you to put that tooth
under your pillow tonight, because we
have a feeling that the tooth fairy
is going to leave you six hundred dollars
for it!

BILLY
Really?

MR. CIRCLOVICH
Really?

DAN AKAWA
Yes, really.  Six hundred dollars. I
might also mention that Billy lives
in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho
Road on Emporia Street. Back to you,
Tom.  How was that?

MR. FOLEY
Perfect. The trap is set.

CAMERAMAN
Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone
will fall for somethin' that stupid?


[The Cartman house. Cartman is in a hot tub, Stan and Kyle sit
nearby]

CARTMAN
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come
on, get your stuff together!  This is
gonna be tits!

KYLE
Dude, this book says I don't exist
unless I think I do. But what if I don't?


CARTMAN
Will somebody take those books away
from him?

[The Circlovich house, night. A Rotary Phone Service van sits
out front. Switch to Billy's room. Dad hides the $600 behind
his back while Mom talks to Billy]

MRS, CIRCLOVICH
Be sure to put your loose tooth under
your pillow, Billy.

BILLY
Okay-y, Mom.

MR. FOLEY
Thank you for helping out, gentlemen.
If this sting operation works, some
bogus tooth fairies should be showing
up to take the sick kid's money. When
they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm
will sound, and that's when you hit
the button, Murphy, and activate the
lights. Everybody got it?

DENTISTS
Got it.

MURPHY
Duuuh, which button do I hit again,
boss?  Just kidding. You know how there's
always the dumb guy in sting operations
in the movies? I was, you know I was
actin', I was actin' like him, eheh,
oh.

[The highway, night. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle walk along a path
paralleling the highway. Cartman is dressed as the tooth fairy.]


CARTMAN
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get
that sick kid's tooth fairy money before
Loogie does.

KYLE
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean,
all the stuff I've been reading; I really
don't think I exist!

STAN
Dude, just stop thinking about it.


KYLE
But I can't, because, what if thinking
about it is the only thing keeping my
space-time together?

KENNY
(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)


KYLE
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing
down,  and my own existence fading.


[The Circlovich house, the van.]

BILLY
G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.

MR. FOLEY
Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled.


BILLY
I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my
tooth under the pillow. Do you really
think the tooth fairy will give me money
for the transplant?

MR. CIRCLOVICH
I think so, Billy. I think so.

BILLY
Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and
strong again.

CARTMAN
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait
a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that
600 bucks is mine!

KYLE
Light is a wave unless it's observed?
That means all matter is just a wave.
Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh
God, it's happening!

STAN
Kyle?

MURPHY
Eh something strange is happening with
the computers.

LOOGIE
Well, well, well. What do we have here?


STAN
Aw, shit.

LOOGIE
Did you bastards really think you could
hide from me forever? Kolovski , put
this buttwipe out of his misery.


CARTMAN
I got it!

BILLY
The tooth fairy!

MR. FOLEY
Let's move out!

LOOGIE
Aw, drat!

MR. FOLEY
Give it up, kids. You're surrounded
by dentists.

LOOGIE
It was a trap!

MR. FOLEY
That's right. And now it's all exposed!
You're through! The only thing left
to do is to haul all you kids down to
prison!

A VOICE
This is reality! I am everywhere , and
nowhere.

MR. FOLEY
What the hell?

CARTMAN
Kyle?

KYLE
I am nothing, and everything.

DR. ROBERTS
Well, I told you!

MR. FOLEY
Let's get outta here!

KYLE
Hunh. That was pretty weird.

LOOGIE
Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup
all along!  How could I be so stupid?!


STAN
What?

LOOGIE
I can't believe I fell for such an obvious
trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!


CARTMAN
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard,
dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They
lie. Lie right to your face.

LOOGIE
Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has
fallen.

STAN
Really?

LOOGIE
Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the
flag football team this year anyways.


STAN
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?


LOOGIE
Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole
thing's over with.

KYLE
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something
today. You see, the basis of all reasoning
is the mind's awareness of itself. What
we think, the external objects we perceive,
are all like actors that come on and
off stage. But our conscioousness, the
stage itself, is always present to us.


CARTMAN
...Tits.

[The Platte River, day. Kenny has turned to his left. As the
end credits roll, Kenny tries with great effort to make his way
to a bank. He hops a few times and lands in a hidden gully in
which he promptly drowns. A motorized chair is soon heard]


TIMMY
Timmy!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"


Episode 814


"WOODLAND CRITTER CHRISTMAS"


Written by


Trey Parker





[A panoramic view of South Park, day. Holiday music is heard
in the background, and the scenes are played out as the narrator
mentions them]

NARRATOR
Way up in the mountains in a small little
town,

The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.

People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,


Because Christmas need to be bought in a store.

But out in the forest, not too far away...

[A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest
upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate
it.]

NARRATOR
...The little woodland critters were
also preparing for their Christmas day.


WOODLAND CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,


The time that's only once a year.

We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.

A Woodland Critter Christmas!

NARRATOR
The little critters worked hard as they
happily sang

And each one of them had a quite interesting name

There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,

Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear

Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,

Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer

Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,

and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.


And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,

was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.

STAN
What the hell?

SINGER
Christmastime is once a year

Every critter holds it dear

Every animal big or small

Christmas means so much to us all

[The forest. The critters approach Stan.]

RABBITY
Well hello there. Welcome to our forest.


SKUNKY
How do you like our Christmas tree?


STAN
It's... nice.

BEAVERY
Why, it's the most perfect tree in the
forest!

MOUSEY
Oh no, I see a problem.

DEERY
What is it, Mousey?

MOUSEY
Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.


CRITTERS
Ohhhh

BEARY
We can't have a tree with no star on
it.

RABBITY
What are we gonna do?

SQUIRRELY
Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our
new friend can help us find a star.


CRITTERS
Can you really? Oh would you please?
Could you help us?

STAN
Okay, okay.

CRITTERS
Yay!!

NARRATOR
And so, using some paper and working
with glee,

the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree

CRITTERS
Ohhhh

BEARY
It's the nicest star I ever saw.

NARRATOR
The little critters cheered and Beavery
said with a smile

BEAVERY
How would you like to sing and dance
with us for a while?

NARRATOR
The boy in the red poofball hat smiled
and said

STAN
Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home.


BEAVERY
Goo, goodbye Stanny!

CRITTERS
Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy
your hat!

STAN
Wugh.

[Stan's bedroom, night. He's asleep in bed, but wakes up, turns
over, and turns on his light]

CRITTERS
Hi, Stanny!

STAN
Oh, whatta?

NARRATOR
His friends were all there! What a wonderful
surprise!

The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes

STAN
What time is it!

SQUIRRELY
You aren't gonna believe what happened,
Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas
gift ever!

SKUNKY
Porcupiney is pregnant!

STAN
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.


MOUSEY
I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand
the seriousness of the fertilization.


DEERY
Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her
conception was immaculate.

FOXY
She's gonna give birth to our Lord and
Savior.

STAN
...What?

PORCUPINEY
It has been foretold unto me that I
would give birth on Christmas Day.


MOUSEY
So soon!

SKUNKY
How delightful!

WOODPECKERY
Our souls are saved!

CHICKADEE-Y
Finally the critters are gonna have
a Savior of their very own, of their
very own!

SQUIRRELY
There's just one problem: We don't
have a manger for our Savior to be born
in.

CRITTERS
Awwww.

BEARY
But we got to have a manger.

RABBITY
Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us
a manger? Huh?

NARRATOR
"Of course I'll build you a little manger!"
the little boy cried,

and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!


[The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last
few nails in place]

NARRATOR
And out in the woods the boy steamed
right ahead,

making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head

RABBITY
Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger
I ever saw.

MOUSEY
I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly
suitable resting place, for the Son
of our Lord.

RACCOONY
Does this mean we can go to sleep now?


PORCUPINEY
My Son will have the nicest bed in all
the forest.

WOODPECKERY
Fit for a king!

SQUIRRELY
This is going to be the best critter
Christmas ever!

WOODLAND CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,


The time that's only once a year.

We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near-

STAN
All right, I'm going now

CRITTERS
The mountain lion! Hide!

STAN
Go away! Shoo!

SQUIRRELY
Is it gone?

MOUSEY
I deduce it is.

SKUNKY
I'm not c-c-comin' out.

FOXY
Well, this is the end. The mountain
lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant,
and he's gonna kill it again.

STAN
Again?

SQUIRRELY
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes
down and eats the virgin critter impregnated
with the Son of our Lord.

PORCUPINEY
Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.

BEAVERY
Let's face it. The mountain lion will
never let our Savior be born.

CRITTERS
Awwww.

SQUIRRELY
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas.
We've got Stanny!

RACCOONY
Of course! Stanny can do anything! If
he can build a manger, he can stop that
mean ol' mountain lion!

PORCUPINEY
Christmas is saved!

[The camera looks up from the woods to a mountain in the distance.
Dramatic music plays]

NARRATOR
High up in the forest on a dark, craggy
peak,

the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.

For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty
old cat...

STAN
Goddamnit, this is fucking ridiculous!


NARRATOR
Said the little boy in the red poofball
hat.

[he looks at a cave entrance, then up at the peak]

Killing the mountain lion was no easy task,

but he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.

STAN
Grrr. Grrr! Come on out!  Come on,
critter killer! Your days of slaughtering
innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!
Rawrrrrr!

NARRATOR
In a flash it was over! A victorious
blow!

The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.

[The cave entrance. Stan sees that the mountain lion is motionless
and approaches]

STAN
Hokay, there.

MIDDLE CUB
Mommy? Mommy!  W... wake up, Mommy,
wake up!

PALE CUB
Don't leave us, Mommy.  Man-boy, why?
Why did you kill our mommy? Why?

STAN
I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth
of a Savior?

NARRATOR
The tiny cubs all gathered together
and cried,

All alone in the world because their mother had died.

STAN
Aw. Awww!

[The forest floor, night. The critters have set up a campfire
close to the manger and are keeping warm by it.]

PORCUPINEY
Oooo.

BEARY
You all right, Lady Porcupiney?

PORCUPINEY
Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.


BEAVERY
Well, it's been much too long now. Uh
I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny
must be very dead.

FOXY
Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed
him whole.

RABBITY
I guess that means our Savior is gonna
be made into Savior stew.

CRITTERS
Awwww.

CHICKADEE-Y
Wait a minute, look!

CRITTERS
Stanny!

MOUSEY
Stanny, you're alive.

BEARY
But, does that mean you killed the mountain
lion?

STAN
It's dead.

DEERY
For real and for true?

BEAVERY
Are you sure.

STAN
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.


SQUIRRELY
He did it! Now our critter Christmas
can finally happen! Hail Satan!

CRITTERS
Hail Satan!

STAN
Wait, wha-what?

BEAVERY
You've done us a huge favor, Stanny!
Without the mountain lion around, the
Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the
Antichrist!

CRITTERS
Yaaay Satan!

STAN
Waiwait, the Antichrist?? You said she
was giving birth to your savior!

SQUIRRELY
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan,
Prince of Darkness.

STAN
But I thought you meant the Son of God!


DEERY
Well, think about it: You really think
God would have sex with a porcupine?


CHICKADEE-Y
No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness
and King of all Evil would do that!
Yay!

FOXY
This just calls for a celebration! Let's
sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!


RABBITY
Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!

[the other critters cheer. Stan is frozen stunned as Beary pulls
up a satanic altar on a small wagon with a little help from Squirrely.
The other animals bring Rabbity up to the altar. Rabbity is propped
up on the altar and Beary tears him apart with a big knife. The
other animals crowd in, tear away pieces of the body, and eat
them raw]

CHICKADEE-Y
Drink his blood! Drink his blood!

SQUIRRELY
Blood orgy!!!

CRITTERS
Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!

[the critters drench themselves in Rabbity's blood and begin
the orgy. Beavery mounts Raccoony, Skunky mounts Porcupiney,
Mousey mounts foxy, and Beary mounts Deery. Squirrely hope onto
Deery's left ear and mounts that. Chickadee-y flits around. In
the background is heard "Sting, so true!" Stan is traumatized
now.]

CRITTERS
What special time and special day,


It's Woodland Critter Christmas.

SQUIRRELY
Hail Satan.

[The forest floor, night. The critters return to the manger and
decorate it. As the narrator speaks, the following takes place.
The star atop the manger is turned so it points down. Owls bring
flowers to the mountain lion's corpse. The lion cubs are shown,
then the mountain peak, then Stan is shown with his head buried
into his arms at his desk in his room]

NARRATOR
In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas
Eve morn,

The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be
born.

The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,


But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.


And meanwhile three lion cubs were crying away.

For them there would certainly be no Christmas Day,

And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.


All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.


STAN
Ugh.

NARRATOR
Now that he'd killed the noble lion
queen,

there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.

STAN
Uuugh!

NARRATOR
"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,


"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"


STAN
No nonono.

NARRATOR
He ran out the living room, turned out
the light,

and went back to the forest to set everything right!

[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on
the TV. "The Jeffersons" theme song is heard.]

NARRATOR
... and went back to the forest to set
everything right!

[Stan looks at the show, willfully ignoring the narrator]

... He tried to forget all about it by watching TV

[Stan tries to change channels, but the remote is broken]

but his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did
flee.

... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!


[Stan rolls his eyes]

He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!

STAN
Leave me aLONE!!

NARRATOR
He knew that only by going to the forest
could he-

STAN
All right all right all right!! God!!


[The manger at the forest clearing, day. The animals continue
decorating]

BEAVERY
Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal,
Stanny.

WOODPECKERY
Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!


DEERY
Yeah. We've got a big problem.

SQUIRRELY
The Great Satan has commanded that when
the Antichrist is born, we must find
a human host body to transfer it into.


CHICKADEE-Y
That way he could take over the whole
world. The whole world!

MOUSEY
The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic
against Christ.

BEAVERY
We figured you'd be perfect!

CRITTERS
Yay!

STAN
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and
my family's Christian!

CRITTERS
Awwwww.

BEARY
But we got to have a human host body
for the Antichrist.

DEERY
Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critters
C-Christmas after all.

SQUIRRELY
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can
help us find non-baptized heathen human.


CHICKADEE-Y
Will you really, Stanny?

STAN
No!! I'm not doing you anymore favors
and I'm not letting you give birth to
the Antichrist!  I came here to put
a stop to all this!

BEAVERY
To stop us?

BEARY
But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop
us, we'd have to use our evil satanic
powers on ya.

STAN
Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the
manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!!  Aagh!
Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH!! AAAAAAAH!!

BEARY
Oh boy! Our satanic powers sure did
the trick!

CHICKADEE-Y
Our powers get stronger every day, get
stronger every day!

SQUIRRELY
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can
stop the birth of the Antichrist, except
for a mountain lion.

SKUNKY
And you got rid o'her.

CRITTERS
Yay!

NARRATOR
The boy shook with anger! He broke a
sweat and fell ill

When he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive
on the hill!

STAN
Oh yeah.

[The mountain peak, day. Stan climbs up to the cave again.]


STAN
Hello? Anybody in there?

DARK CUB
Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!


MEDIUM CUB
He's come to kill us now.

LIGHT CUB
It's okay. I died inside when Mommy
was killed anyways.

DARK CUB
Yeah, better this than the slow death
we'd face without a mother around.


STAN
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The,
the squirrel told me she was evil.


MEDIUM CUB
You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee,
you're not too smart, are you, mister?


STAN
I'm trying to make this all right again,
but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping
critters is a mountain lion!

DARK CUB
Yeah, and you killed her.

STAN
Well, you're mountain lions.

LIGHT CUB
Us? No, we're just kids. We still have
our baby teeth.

MEDIUM CUB
And our baby claws.

DARK CUB
And a dead mom.

STAN
There still has to be a way for you
to kill the porcupine's baby.

DARK CUB
What? You mean like in an abortion?


LIGHT CUB
Yeah. An abortion. That can work.

MEDIUM CUB
But, we don't know how to give abortions.


DARK CUB
Do you know some place we can learn,
mister?

NARRATOR
"Where can they learn that?" the boy
said with a frown.

"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."

STAN
What?!

NARRATOR
So he picked up the cubs and down the
mountain he stormed.

And took them to where abortions are performed.

STAN
No, he didn't.

NARRATOR
Yes he did.

STAN
No, he didn't!

NARRATOR
Yes he did.

STAN
No, he didn't!!

NARRATOR
Yes he  did!

STAN
Aw Goddamnit!

NARRATOR
Said the boy in the red poofball hat!
"We've made it already, little cubs!
Fancy that!"

DOCTOR
Excuse me, what are you doing here?!


NARRATOR
The abortion doctor inquired.

DOCTOR
If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is
required!

STAN
I don't know, I, I'm supposed to show
these mountain lions how an abortion
is performed or something, I... I know,
it'd ridiculous.

DOCTOR
Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!


It's only three days until Christmas, so I have LOTS of abortions
to perform!

Gather around my table, cute little lions,

I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!

NARRATOR
And so the little boy and the cubs gathered
around the chair base,

And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.

[Montage. The doctor puts on his gloves and the cubs peer into
the patient's vagina. Stan peers in as well, from a distance.
The doctor works away happily and cleans up well. The patient
leaves, and the next one is worked on. One of the cubs is on
a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle
off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone
turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The
doctor works on the next patient and the dark cub brings him
some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The
other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and
she smiles at them]

SINGER
Christmas time is once a year.

Every critter holds it dear.

Every animal big or small,

Christmas means so much to us all.

It's once a year, it's Christmastime!

And it happens once a year.

It's once a year, it's Christmastime!

When we hear about how Christmas only comes

Once a year.

STAN
This better have a point, dude. This
really better have a point.

[The forest floor. The critters walk along singing their Christmas
tune]

CRITTERS
It's almost time when the time is here,


The time that's only once a year.

BEARY
Oh look. That little feller is all alone.


SKUNKY
Gee, he looks sad.

CRITTERS
Hi there!

KYLE
What the hell?

BEAVERY
How come you're all alone on Christmas
Eve.

KYLE
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.


RACCOONY
Aww, but why?

KYLE
Well, because, we don't really ...believe
in Jesus.

CRITTERS
Yay!

BEARY
But does that mean you aren't baptized?


KYLE
No. I'm Jewish.

CRITTERS
Yay! Yay!

BEAVERY
You've got to come with us!

DEERY
You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!

KYLE
Huh?

CRITTERS
Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!

What special time and special day,

It's Woodland Critter Christmas.

SQUIRRELY
Hail Satan.

[The woods, night. The camera pans along]

NARRATOR
Twas the night before Christmas, and
above the woods, way up high,

a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.

[bright RED star. Stan walks into view]

For the world to be saved there was only one shot.

A little boy with three cubs, and an abortion plot.

STAN
Okay, come on, the critters are over
this way. You mountain lions ready to
stop the Antichrist from being born?


DARK CUB
Sure. We know how to give abortions
now.

NARRATOR
He arrived at the critter forest ready
to fight,

but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.

[the critters are in and around the manger looking at the new
baby, the Antichrist]

BEAVERY
Guys, we did it!

SQUIRRELY
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin'
a thousand years of darkness to the
forest.

NARRATOR
The Antichrist had been born, sealing
the world's fate.

The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.

STAN
Too late? The hell is that??

BEAVERY
Oh. Hiya, Stanny!

KYLE
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going
on?!

STAN
It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks
ass!

SKUNKY
Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist
into our human host.

CRITTERS
Let's go! All right! Woohoo!

STAN
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness
and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?!


NARRATOR
When up in the sky the sound of sleigh
bells were heard And a jolly red sleigh
flew down to the earth like a bird!


BEAVERY
Wwow, look, there's Santa Claus!

CRITTERS
Yay!

SKUNKY
Let's eat his flesh!

SANTA
All right, what the hell is going on?!
Why is there a red star glowing in the
sky?!

RACCOONY
We finally did it, Santa! We brought
forth the Antichrist with help from
our good friend, Stanny.

SKUNKY
Death and pain await all living things.


SANTA
LIttle boy, you should be ashamed!


STAN
I mean, I didn't mean to help them,
I I tried to stop them!

SANTA
Well good going, stupid! There's only
one way to stop devil-worshiping critters!


CRITTERS
Aaaaah!

STAN
Dude, what the?

SINGERS
Hold steady, Santa

[Santa simply hops through it, gets into position, and fires
at Squirrely, blowing him to smithereens.]

STAN
Come on, dude.

BEARY
Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill
me, are you-

DARK CUB
But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist?


SANTA
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot
survive without a human host body to
go into.

KYLE
No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist
inside me!

STAN
What? Kyle??

KYLE
With his power, I can finally make
the earth a better place for the Jews!


SANTA
Don't do it, Kyle!

STAN
Dude!!

KYLE
Yes, yes!! Now the Jews will take control
of Christmas once and for all! HAHA!
HAAA!!

KYLE
Oh, stop it, Cartman!

[Mr. Garrison's class, day. All the students are seated, and
they're taking turns telling Christmas stories. Cartman is telling
his now.]

KYLE
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't
reading another sentence of your stupid
story!

CARTMAN
I don't believe anyone interrupted YOU
when you read your Christmas story aloud,
Kyle.

KYLE
This whole time your stupid story was
just a way to rip on me for being Jewish
at Christmas again!

CARTMAN
Mr. Garrison, could you do something,
please?

MR. GARRISON
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated
against, you'll have to stop or else
I'll get a call from his mother.

CARTMAN
All right, fine! Forget it!

BUTTERS
Wwell but, but what happened?

TOKEN
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years
of darkness or not?

CLYDE
What happens to the lion cubs?

CARTMAN
Well, I guess we'll never know, because
Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.


STAN
No, it all worked out, right? The world
was saved and I went home for Christmas
dinner.

KYLE
Dude, why do you care?!

STAN
Well after all that I at least wanna
know if I had a merry Christmas or if
darkness rules the earth.

KYLE
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens!
I get killed by Santa Claus so that
Christmas is saved!

CARTMAN
That's not at all what happens.

BUTTERS
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the
end.

CLYDE
Yeah yeah, come on!

KYLE
All right, fine!

CARTMAN
"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed!
How about that?" said the little boy
in the red poofball hat.

[The spell is restored. Kyle is back on the altar exulting]


KYLE
HAHAHAA!! Now I shall rule the-  Aww.
Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is
on fire! Whoa. Oh, I don't like this!
I didn't know it would feel so... dark
and evil!

STAN
Well what did you expect, dude? It's
the son of the Devil.

KYLE
Oh God, what have I done??  I'm sorry.
Please, I don't wanna be the vessel
for the Antichrist.

SANTA
I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle!
Santa's gonna have to kill you!

STAN
No Santa, don't!

SANTA
We don't have a choice. In a few hours,
the dark creature inside him will consume
his soul.

NARRATOR
The little boy fretted. He almost started
to bawl

But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.

[Stan grins]

STAN
The lion cubs!

NARRATOR
The little boy quickly begun,

STAN
I took them to see how abortions are
done.

SANTA
What??

STAN
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry
up fast!

Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!

[the cubs trot over to Kyle, who's on a makeshift delivery bed]


NARRATOR
And in the twinkling starlight, each
little cub did their portion.

They remember all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.


[The dark cub is deep in Kyle's ass, retrieving the Antichrist
with his teeth. He succeeds and takes it to Santa quickly. Santa
takes it and sets it down on a stump. Santa grabs a large mallet
next to the stump, raises it over his head, and bring it down
upon the Antichrist, smashing it to bits with a loud THUD]


KYLE
Thanks, everybody. I I'm sorry I got
a little crazy there.

SANTA
Well little boy, it seems that YOU
have really been through a lot. Is there
any special present you would like this
year?

STAN
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

[The lions' cave. Santa arrives at the corpse of the mountain
lioness and moves his hand over it, releasing some magic dust
and watching it settle. The lioness stirs]

MOTHER LION
Weh, ah my, what happened?

A CUB
Mommy?

THE CUBS
Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!


STAN
Ogh, good.

[Stan's house. He runs into his parents' arms as Shelley and
Grandpa look on. Next, they're all seated at table, eating. Next,
Stan and Shelley are opening their gifts]

NARRATOR
And back home, there were presents,
and lots of food to get fat.

And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball
hat.

[A shot of the town, receding from view]

NARRATOR
And they all lived happily ever after.
Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two
weeks later.

The End

KYLE
Goddamnit Cartman!

THE END
"SOUTH PARK"

Episode 202

"Cartman's Mom Is Still A Dirty Slut"

Written by

Trey Parker and David Goodman



ACT I

INT. MEPHESTO'S LAB

NARRATOR
Previously, on 'South Park'...

The scene is just as we had left it on episode 113.

NARRATOR
An air of sobriety fills the
laboratory as the men of South Park
gather to find out which one of them
fathered this boy --

ANGLE CARTMAN

Cartman bites into a doughnut and sips at a drink.

NARRATOR
Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the
end of tonight's episode, you WILL
KNOW the answer!!

ROLL SOUTH PARK OPENING SEQUENCE

EXT. MEPHESTO'S LAB - NIGHT

Establishing.

INT. MEPHESTO'S LAB

Everyone is gathered around in Mephesto's office, waiting in
anticipation.

MEPHESTO
And now... To continue, the father
is indeed someone in this room!

CARTMAN
Man, this feels like the longest
minute of my life!

Stan and Kyle stand there waiting. Kenny suddenly appears
next to them.

STAN
(Confused)
Oh, hey Kenny...

Mephesto takes out the card and reads it.

MEPHESTO
Gentlemen, the father is...

Everyone's eyes get big. Music SWELLS.

But then, suddenly, the lights go out!

MR. GARRISON
(In darkness)
Hey, what the hell's going on?

JIMBO
It's a power outage!

Suddenly, we hear BANG! BANG! BANG-BANG!

The lights come back on, and everyone looks around.

CHEF
Is everybody okay? That sounded like
a gunshot!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh my God! LOOK!!

Mephesto is lying on the floor, bleeding from gunshot wounds.

KENNY
(Oh my God! They've
killed Mephesto!)
Mph mm Mrm! Mrphph mrph MrphMprhMrph!!

KYLE
You bastards!

MR. GARRISON
Mephesto's been shot!!

Everyone rushes over to Mephesto's body.

CHEF
Is he dead?!

JIMBO
Hey, this window is shot out, too!
That means the killer was NOT somebody
in this room!

MR. GARRISON
Then who was it?!

Suddenly, the narrator's voice bursts in again.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school
counselor?
(As pictures fly past)
Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it --

CARTMAN
Hey! Wait a minute! I didn't find
out who my father was!

NARRATOR (V.O.)
(Pictures continue)
Or was it Ms. Broslofsky?

Chef is leaning down by Mephesto.

CHEF
Wait! He's still breathing! He's not
dead!

A few people help Chef lift up Mephesto and lead him towards
the door. Cartman gets in Mephesto's face.

CARTMAN
GOD DAMMIT! WHO'S MY FATHER?!

But Mephesto is not conscious.

CHEF
We have to get him to the hospital!

CARTMAN
You've got to be kidding me!!!!

CHEF
Come on, children!

The boys follow Chef out the door.

CARTMAN
Oh!

MR. BROVLOFSKI
Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell
for him going through all this.

Ms. Cartman is standing right next to him. When she hears
this, she lowers her head and walks away.

JIMBO
There's a murderer free in South
Park! We have to find out who it is
before they kill again!

MR. GARRISON
Yeah, God only knows who they'll
kill next?

NARRATOR
Who will they kill next? Will it be
Jimbo?
(Slides again)
Barbrady? The Denver Broncos...?

INT. CHEF'S CAR - NIGHT

Chef drives with Cartman in the front seat and the boys in
back, with an unconscious Mephesto in the way back.

CARTMAN
Is he awake yet?

KYLE
He's bleeding pretty bad back here.

CHEF
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith
Baxter Birney memorial towel.

KYLE
What's a Meredith Baxter Birney
Memorial towel?

CHEF
I actually was with Meredith Baxter
Birney in this very car, and
afterwards, we used that towel to...
Wait a minute, why am I telling you
this?

Meanwhile, Stan is looking incredibly sick.

STAN
Could you pull over so I can get
out?

CHEF
What? We have to get to the hospital!

STAN
I have to get out first, I'm not
gonna make it. I can't stand
hospitals!

CHEF
Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop
Mephesto off, and then we can get
out of there, alright?

KYLE
Man, it's really starting to snow, I
hope they don't close the roads.

CARTMAN
They can't! Mephesto can't die!!!

KYLE
Maybe it's better you don't know who
your father is, Cartman.

CARTMAN
No way dude, I can't stand to leave
things unfinished. It's like when
you hear the first part of that song
"Come Sail Away" by Styx. If I hear
the first part I have to finish it.

Everybody looks at each other, confused.

KYLE
Really?

CARTMAN
Yeah. I can't do anything until it's
done.

KYLE
I'm sailingg awayyy...

CARTMAN
No! Don't!

KYLE
Set an open course for the Virgin
Sea...

Kyle stops abruptly. Cartman sits and shakes. He turns red
like he's trying desperately to hold back. Finally, his mouth
opens and it comes bursting forth.

CARTMAN
-- Cause I've got to be free to carry
on. Duh-dun (and so on)

KYLE
Woa, dude!

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

Chef's car speeds up the mountain road.

A small, single snowflake falls from the sky and lands on
the sign that reads 'Hell's Pass Hospital - 35 miles'

OMINOUS MUSIC STING.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Everyone is gathered in the Mayor's Office. She tries to
calm them down.

JIMBO
What are we going to do, Mayor? This
killer is on the loose!!

KYLE'S MOTHER
We can't even leave our homes for
fear of our children's safety!

STAN'S MOTHER
Uh... Where are our children?

Everyone looks around.

MAYOR
Officer Barbrady... Let's pretend
for one second that we had a competent
law enforcer in this town. What would
HE do?

BARBRADY
Hmm... That's a good question,
Mayor... Let me get right on that
with thinking.

Barbrady goes into a trance.

Suddenly, a crew of people carrying film equipment rush in.

DIRECTOR
Mayor! Mayor!

MAYOR
The press is here!

DIRECTOR
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the
director from Los Angeles for
'America's Most Wanted'.

MAYOR
You certainly made it up here quickly.

DIRECTOR
We're desperate for stories.
(Catching himself)
AND this one is so compelling!

MAYOR
Really?

DIRECTOR
Sure! This story has everything!
People... furniture... talking...
It's a real American story.

BARBRADY
Hey, I thought of something!
(Pause)
Er... No wait, that's subtraction...

MAYOR
(Ignoring this)
Mr. Director person, what exactly do
you want to do?

JIMBO
Mayor, shouldn't we be focusing on --

MAYOR
Shh!

DIRECTOR
We just want to do a recreation of
the story for our show. Then we'll
flash a number on the screen that
people can call if they have any
information regarding the identity
or location of the shooter. That's
it. You win. We win. America wins.

MAYOR
Are you sure this wouldn't make our
little town look dangerous?

DIRECTOR
Don't worry, Mayor, America's Most
Wanted is not about violence, it's
about family.

CAMERA GUY
It is?

MAYOR
Well, in that case, I guess it's
okay.

DIRECTOR
Great! We'll get started with
auditions immediately. What part
should we cast first?

Again the Narrator's voice bursts in.

NARRATOR
WHO WILL THE DIRECTOR CAST FIRST?!
WILL IT BE MR. GARRISON? OFFICER
BARBRADY? CHEF...?

EXT. UNPLANNED PARENTHOOD - DAY

The snow falls on this small, humble clinic.

MS. CARTMAN (V.O.)
I want to have an abortion.

INT. UNPLANNED PARENTHOOD - DAY

SOCIAL WORKER
Oh, well we can do that. This must
be a very difficult time for you
Mrs...

MS. CARTMAN
Cartman... Yes, It's such a hard
decision. But I just don't feel I
can raise a child in this screwy
world.

SOCIAL WORKER
Yes, Ms. Cartman, if you don't feel
fit to raise a child, an abortion
probably is the answer. Do you know
the actual time of conception?

MS. CARTMAN
About eight years ago.

The Social Worker looks confused.

SOCIAL WORKER
I see... So the fetus is...

MS. CARTMAN
Eight years old.

SOCIAL WORKER
Ms. Cartman, eight years old is a
little late to be considering
abortion.

MS. CARTMAN
Really?

SOCIAL WORKER
Yes, this is what we would refer to
as the FORTIETH trimester.

MS. CARTMAN
But I just don't think I'm a fit
mother.

SOCIAL WORKER
Well, but we prefer to abort babies
a little earlier on. In fact, there's
a law against abortions after the
second trimester.

MS. CARTMAN
Well... I think you need to keep
your laws off of my body.

SOCIAL WORKER
Hmmm... I'm afraid I can't help you,
Ms. Cartman. If you want to change
the law, you'll have to speak with
your congressman.

MS. CARTMAN
(A little pissed)
Well, then that's EXACTLY what I
intend to do! Good day!

EXT. HELL'S PASS HOSPITAL - DAY

Chef's car pulls up. Snow is falling heavily.

CHEF
Come on children, we gotta find a
doctor!

Stan stops at the door.

STAN
I can't do it, dude!

KYLE
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all
that bad.

CARTMAN
Yeah, stop being a wuss.

INT. HELL'S PASS HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Chef and the children enter to find a doctor and nurse
standing over a patient in the ER.

CHEF
Doctor!

DOCTOR
One moment please! NURSE! I need
twenty CCs of sodium pentothal, STAT!!

The nurse runs over to the surgical tray. She has no arms,
however, and must pick up the syringe with her teeth.

KYLE
Woa, dude, she doesn't have any arms!

DOCTOR
We're an equal opportunity employer
here, son.

The nurse spits the syringe into the doctor's hands.

CHEF
Doctor, we've got a shot cracker
outside!

DOCTOR
I'll be with you right after I inject
this man with a long needle.

STAN
Oh man, I'm gonna be sick...

DOCTOR
There, there, young man. Medical
science is nothing to be afraid of.

To remove the air from the syringe, the doctor squirts out a
long stream of pentothal.

STAN
UGH!

The doctor injects the patient.

NURSE GOODLY
Oooh, I think you're hitting the
bone!!

STAN
(Turning blue)
AAGHH!

DOCTOR
Yeah, I can hear the needle scraping
against the bone inside!

Sccccrrrreeeee...

DOCTOR
Oop, he's hemorrhaging!

A long, thick arc of blood squirts through the air and hits
the ground next to Stan.

Now, for absolutely no reason, the patient's head falls off
and hits the ground.

DOCTOR
Oop! His head fell off!

STAN
I'm gettin' outta here!!!

KYLE
Stan!

DOCTOR
Well, some people just have a weak
stomach.

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Establishing.

AMW has not set up a little trailer, but a huge complex with
a sign: AMERICA'S MOST WANTED: SOUTH PARK HEADQUARTERS

INT. AUDITORIUM

The Director sits in the dimly lit theatre seats, listening
to actors as they audition for parts.

A sign on the small stage reads 'America's Most Wanted
Auditions'

A very average looking man, wearing Mephesto's Hawaiian shirt
is on the stage, reading from a script.

MEPHESTO ACTOR
And the father of Eric Cartman is...
BANG! Ugh!! Jimminy! I've been shot!!

DIRECTOR
Oh, thank you very much, we'll get
back to you.

The actor leaves.

DIRECTOR
I think I've seen enough genetic
engineers. Let's move on to the
auditions for the part of...
(Looking at papers)
Mr... Garrison.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!!

A young actor comes out with a sock on his hand.

ACTOR
Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric
Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
(As Mr. Hat)
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

DIRECTOR
Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on
the top pile. Next!

Mr. Garrison walks out.

MR. GARRISON
I sure hope that I am not Eric
Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
(As Mr. Hat)
You can say that again Mr. Garrison.

DIRECTOR
Thank you -- NEXT!

MR. GARRISON
What?

DIRECTOR
NEXT!

Garrison looks puzzled and walks away.

A very good looking actor takes his place.

GOOD LOOKING ACTOR
I sure hope that I am not Eric
Cartman's father Mr. Hat.
(As Mr. Hat)
You can say that again Mr. Garrison.

DIRECTOR
PERFECT! YOU GOT IT!!

Mr. Garrison exchanges looks with Mr. Hat.

DIRECTOR
Let's move on to the Chefs!

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ms. Cartman is lying naked in bed with a clean cut gentleman,
who is smoking a cigarette.

MS. CARTMAN
And so you see Congressman O'Riley,
that's why I think abortion laws
should be changed.

CONGRESSMAN
Well, all I know is that third
trimester abortions are illegal. I
don't really know anything about
fortieth.

MS. CARTMAN
But the lady at Unplanned Parenthood
said you were who I had to talk to
about changing the law.

CONGRESSMAN
No, No, I think you gotta talk to
the Governor about that stuff.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh dear.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

We see Chef's car being buried by the heavy snowfall.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

Chef and Cartman and the boys stand around a bed where
Mephesto is lying, hooked up to all kinds of machines.

DOCTOR
Well, this is about all I can do for
him.

CARTMAN
Can't you get him to talk? I have to
know who my father is!!

DOCTOR
Sorry, son, it might be a while.

Cartman jumps up on Mephesto and starts slapping him in the
face.

CARTMAN
WAKE UP YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!!

CHEF
WOA!

DOCTOR
(Pulling him off)
Now, son, that's not gonna do him
any good. I'll let you know if there's
a change in his condition.

CARTMAN
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE!! WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!

KYLE
Hey, Cartman...

CARTMAN
What?

KYLE
I'mmmmm sailinngg aw --

Kyle stops. Cartman's eyes grow wide. He starts to shake.

CARTMAN
...way set an open course on the
Virgin Sea.
(continues)

STAN
Okay, okay. Let's get out of here
now.

KYLE
I don't know if that's gonna be too
easy...

Kyle is looking out the window, where the blizzard has
intensified. Chef's car is completely buried.

DOCTOR
My God, that's a hell of a storm.

STAN
Oh, weak...

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

Snow has started to fall in South Park.

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

The director is looking out the window at the falling snow.

DIRECTOR
God I hate mountains. This better
not push back our shooting schedule.

Now the director steps back, and we see that he is next to a
huge facade of Mephesto's lab. Movie cameras and lights
abound.

A full cast is on hand, with actors dressed up as all the
main characters.

DIRECTOR
Okay people, let's rehearse the
reenactment from the top before we
shoot it.

Everyone takes their places.

DIRECTOR
Who's that?

Eric Roberts is wearing a Hawaiian shirt and walking around.

ASSISTANT
Oh that's T.V.'s Eric Roberts, we
were able to get him to play the
part of the little monkey guy.

DIRECTOR
Oooh, talk about washed up, huh?
(To Eric, louder)
Great to have you, Eric!

Eric waves.

DIRECTOR
Here we go... And... ACTION!!

MEPHESTO ACTOR
I want to announce who the father is --

DIRECTOR
BANG!

MEPHESTO ACTOR
Oh! I've been shot!

BARBRADY ACTOR
Nobody move! I'm a law officer!

CHEF ACTOR
My God... I think he's gone into
cardiac arrest.

BARBRADY ACTOR
You seem somewhat unnerved by this,
Chef.

CHEF ACTOR
Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because
if you are, accuse! Don't hide behind
your clever riddles.

BARBRADY ACTOR
Our differences must be set aside
for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man.
A man trying to do my job.

The South Park townspeople are watching from behind the
cameras.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Woa, this is a good movie!

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

Chef and the boys are sitting in the waiting room, bored,
with a plethora of injured people waiting to get attention.

Stan looks to his left where a man is holding his stabbed
arm with the knife still in it.

He grimaces and looks to his right where a woman is bleeding
out her jugular.

CARTMAN
Sail away with meeee!!!!

Cartman takes a deep breath, satisfied.

STAN
Ohhh, dude, when can we get out of
here?

The doctor rushes in and starts tending to the next patient.

JUGULAR WOMAN
Doctor! I can't focus!

DOCTOR
We're doing the best we can, ma'am.
They've closed the pass and none of
the other doctors can get through.
For now it's just me and Nurse Goodly.

Nurse goodly fumbles around for a stethoscope sans arms.

CHEF
Wait a second, they've closed the
pass?

DOCTOR
Yes. I'm afraid we're critically
understaffed. Unless we get help
soon, all these people in here are
completely fucked.

The patients all look at the doctor with worry. A hush falls
over them.

DOCTOR
(To them)
Metaphorically speaking, that is.

CARTMAN
What about Mephesto?! Are you taking
care of him?!

DOCTOR
He's on full life support and
breathing fine. He shouldn't need
any help... So long as the power
doesn't go out.

The power goes out.

Everyone just stands there in complete darkness.

DOCTOR
Whoof, who didn't see that coming a
mile away, huh?

ACT II

ROLL AMERICA'S MOST WANTED INTRODUCTION SEQUENCE

MUSIC. A sequence of chase and arrest scenes, flashing lights
and running cops and robbers.

NARRATOR
Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a
shooter is on the loose in Colorado,
and the residents are up in arms!
Here's your host John Walsh.

JOHN WALSH
Good evening and welcome to America's
Most Wanted. Tonight, terror invaded
the small mountain community of South
Park Colorado when Dr. Alphonse
Mephesto was gunned down in his
laboratory. America's Most Wanted
has reconstructed this heinous crime
in hopes that your calls can solve
the case.

INT. MEPHESTO'S LAB SET - NIGHT

Thunder and lightning blast outside as we see all the actors
in their respective costumes.

MEPHESTO ACTOR
I've been shot!!

MR. GARRISON ACTOR
My God, Mr. Hat, get some help.

MR. HAT ACTOR
(A tall, handsome
actor)
Right away, Mr. Garrison.

ERIC ROBERTS
No! Noo!! My lifetime partner and
friend. Gone, taken away in the wink
of an eye! Oh, fortune! How you mock
me!

DIRECTOR
What the?! Eric Roberts is improving
lines again!

CHEF ACTOR
I'm going to get the man to a
hospital. Who will help me?

ERIC ROBERTS
This is not a world I want to live
in! It is an angry world.

DIRECTOR
Dammit!!

Just then, all the power goes out.

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

A tree has blown over on the power lines. They spark in the
falling snow.

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

DIRECTOR
What the hell is this?!

CAMERA GUY
We've lost the feed to L.A.!

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS IN L.A.

John Walsh is still standing there, but with all the screens
static.

JOHN WALSH
Uhh... We seem to have lost our linkup
to the South Park crew... So I guess
we'll be going to our feature movie,
Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

ANNOUNCER
Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo?
Mr. Garrison? Chef?

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

DIRECTOR
Somebody go see why we lost the
hookup!

Just then, the door blows open and snow flies everywhere.

JIMBO
Holy smokes! That blizzard is gettin'
crazy!

EXT. HOSPITAL OF DOOM - NIGHT

The snow has absolutely buried the hospital. The eerie
moonlight makes the place look like something out of 'The
Shining'

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

The emergency lights have come on, but are noticeably dimmer.

All the patients are screaming and running around in horror.

NURSE GOODLY
Don't panic, anybody. The power lines
are down, but the backup generator
is running fine.

The doctor pops out from the E.R.

DOCTOR
Nurse! I could use some help in here!

NURSE GOODLY
Coming!

But as the nurse heads towards the doctor, Cartman steps in
front of her.

CARTMAN
Lady, is Mephesto going to be okay?

NURSE GOODLY
Yes... For now. But I'm afraid the
generator won't run for long. The
batteries run out in half an hour.
Time is very short.

DOCTOR
Nurse, PLEASE! I need another pair
of HANDS in here!!
(Beat)
Oh... Sorry.

INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT

In a very immaculate bedroom, Ms. Cartman is again lying
naked next to a naked older looking man.

MS. CARTMAN
Don't you see, Govenor? I should
have a right to have an abortion if
I want one.

GOVENOR
Mmm... I don't know I might need
some more convincing.

He rolls over and puts his arm around her.

MS. CARTMAN
I mean, what right do I have bringing
another child into this overpopulated
world? Then again, I should have
thought of that before having sex...
Then again... Oh, I just don't know!

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Stan and Kyle are back with Chef, who is talking to the
doctor.

DOCTOR
Please, Mr. Chef, I have over a
hundred people to tend to here, and
only myself and Nurse Goodly.

CHEF
What do you want me to do?

DOCTOR
Do you know anything about surgery?

CHEF
I used to watch Quincy.

DOCTOR
WHAT?! Why the hell didn't you say
so! Put on some scrubs!!

The doctor turns to the boys.

DOCTOR
Boys, I'm making you all honorary
doctors! You can help us save these
people's lives!

Stan gets a very, very worried look on his face.

STAN
No way, dude!

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

The snow is piled high all around America's Most Wanted.
Everything is absolutely covered.

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

Jimbo opens the front door. A huge mound of snow rushes in,
and blowing snow flies in his face.

JIMBO
Well, we're not going anywhere for a
long time.

DIRECTOR
We're snowed in?

MAYOR
Yes... We're TRAPPED.

MR. GARRISON
Like sailors on a submarine.

Garrison looks at the Director.

MAYOR
My God, this is the worst storm I've
ever seen.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Ohh, I have to get out of here, I
haven't eaten since breakfast.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry too.

JIMBO
I hope you all realize what we might
be facing here...

Everyone looks at Jimbo.

JIMBO
Our only option might be to EAT EACH
OTHER to stay alive!

MUSIC STING. Everybody GASPS.

DIRECTOR
Uhh... It's only been like four hours.
Aren't you resorting to cannibalism
a little quickly?

JIMBO
That's the law of the land, Mr.
Director. I know it ain't pretty,
but if a few of us might die so that
the rest can stay alive so be it.

MAYOR
But how do we decide... who?

JIMBO
Well, we draw straws.

DIRECTOR
(Hysterical)
Now wait a minute! We all had a big
breakfast, can't you people go without
eating for a little --

JIMBO
CALM DOWN, SOLDIER!! WE NEED EVERY
PERSON HERE TO KEEP HIS HEAD!!

Barbrady, fetch some straws.

DIRECTOR
Well who the hell made you the boss
anyway?!

Jimbo opens his mouth to answer, when --

ANNOUNCER
Who the hell made Jimbo Boss? Was it
Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Garrison?

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

The doctor is standing over a patient, who is lying on an
operating table.

DOCTOR
This man's appendix has burst. I
have no choice but to operate now,
with our limited power. I need you
all to be strong for me.

Chef and the boys are wearing scrubs and holding their hands
in the air. Stan is absolutely green with nausea.

DOCTOR
Okay. Nurse Goodly will take care of
anaesthesia. Chef, you'll act as her
arms. Boys, you have to help with
suction and bandages. Ready?

STAN
No.

DOCTOR
Okay, first I'll make an incision on
the chest over the heart.

STAN
Oh, boy.

We see the scalpel cut open a good sized hole. Blood pours
out. Stan immediately pulls his mask off and barfs directly
into the patient's chest.

KYLE
Dude, you barfed into the incision!

CARTMAN
Sweet!

DOCTOR
(Jumping up and down)
Suction!

Kenny pulls the suction cup over the incision. SSSSLLLUURRPP.

Suddenly, the lights begin to dim.

CARTMAN
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?!

The narrator pops up.

NARRATOR
Who IS screwing with the lights?
(Pictured:)
Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the
1991 Denver Broncos?

CARTMAN
That is really starting to piss me
off.

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

Everyone is gathered around and drawing straws from Officer
Barbrady.

JIMBO
Alright, so far everybody has a long
piece of straw. We'll keep drawing...

Jimbo pulls his straw out... It's pretty long. He sighs
relief.

Mr. Garrison pulls his straw out... It's pretty long. He
sighs relief.

The Mayor pulls a straw... It's pretty long. She sighs relief.

Barbrady is left with the last piece... He opens his hand...
And there's ANOTHER long piece of straw.

JIMBO
Whew!

MR. GARRISON
Whew!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Whew!

JIMBO
Wait a minute... Where the hell is
the short one?

OFFICER BARBRADY
The short what?

JIMBO
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws
you're supposed to have one of 'em
short, that's how you decide who
loses!

Barbrady thinks.

OFFICER BARBRADY
That's not how I played it.

MR. GARRISON
Ugh... Could we hurry this up, my
stomach's growling!

INT. HELL'S PASS HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The doctor enters with large blueprints of the hospital. Dim
back up lights are flickering.

DOCTOR
I found a map that shows the location
of a backup generator!

He rolls out the blueprints.

DOCTOR
Apparently they built a large, self-
sustaining generator for just this
kind of emergency. But it's out and
away from the hospital!

CHEF
So how do we get to it?

DOCTOR
We must split up into two teams.
Team A and Team B.

Everyone gathers around and listens closely.

DOCTOR
Team A will consist of myself, Stan,
Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly.
Team B will consist of Kenny.

Kenny's eyes grow wide.

DOCTOR
(To Kenny)
Now listen closely, team B. Your
goal will be turn on the backup
generator. To do this, you must brave
the storm outside and get into this
sewage duct.

He points to these various areas on the blueprint.

DOCTOR
Meanwhile, team A will go to the
holding area... HERE. Where there is
a television and some cocoa. We will
drink the cocoa and watch family
programming until Team B makes it
through the sewage duct.

Kenny looks suspicious.

DOCTOR
By that time, team B (remember, that's
you Kenny) should reach the outer
core of the generator. It will be a
cold and dangerous climb to the top,
and there could be velociraptors
HERE.

Kenny panics.

DOCTOR
Once you reach the top, you should
be able to get a clear view through
THIS window, of us drinking cocoa
and watching television. Then you
can proceed down into the generator
and power it on. Are there any
questions?

CARTMAN
No, that sounds pretty sweet to me.

DOCTOR
Right then, let's DO IT!! GO TEAM!!!

KENNY
Hmph?

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

Everyone is lying on the dimly lit floor, looking as if they
haven't eaten for weeks.

MR. GARRISON
C... Can't go on... S-So H-hungry...

MAYOR
We're all going to die in this
horrible place.

JIMBO
We have to have energy to make it
through the night... We have to eat.

DIRECTOR
How can we? How could we live with
ourselves?

JIMBO
There's only one answer... Eat Eric
Roberts.

Eric Roberts panics.

MAYOR
Yes... Of course. Nobody gives a
shit about Eric Roberts.

MR. GARRISON
Eat Eric Roberts...

ERIC ROBERTS
No!

Everybody closes in on Eric Roberts.

ERIC ROBERTS
No, PLEASE!!

ACT III

INT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

Eric Roberts, now nothing but a carcass, lies off to the
side. Everyone is quietly huddled around the fire.

MAYOR
Well, there's no going back now...
We're cannibals. God save us.

JIMBO
God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Well, I have to admit, Eric Roberts
was much juicer than I expected.

DIRECTOR
Aw!

MR. GARRISON
This snow just isn't letting up.
We're going to die here, I know it.

JIMBO
What time is it, Barbrady?

BARBRADY
(Checking his watch)
It's almost midnight.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, I can't go on...

JIMBO
We'll give the storm another hour.
After that... We might have to eat
again...

DRAMATIC MUSIC.

DIRECTOR
What?! Christ, are you people diabetic
or something?!

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Kenny crawls out of a small duct, covered with sewage. The
horrible storm blows around him in all directions, Kenny can
barely see.

The doctor's voice blasts over Kenny's walkie talkie.

DOCTOR
Team B... Come in, Team B.

KENNY
Mph mh mphm B.

DOCTOR
Listen, Team B, we've found another
path to the generator. There's
actually a nice, heated walkway to
it, so you don't need to walk through
all that sewage.

Kenny looks down at his sewage covered body.

KENNY
(Pissed)
Mph rmph rm rmphm!!!

DOCTOR
Oh... Well forget I said that then.
Listen, team B, you should be seeing
a large drift of snow with some metal
sticking out of it just to your
left...

KENNY
Mph, mpmh mphmh mm.

Kenny spots the snow covered backup generator.

DOCTOR
Good heads towards it, Team A out.

CARTMAN
What if Mephesto never wakes up and
I never find out who my father is?

Little Kenny bravely treads through the deep snow, just as
the shadow of a velocoraptor runs by with a cry.

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

Everyone appears to be eating somberly. We see Eric Roberts's
nearly skeletal corpse, and next to it, the corpses of the
director and his assistant.

The Mayor forks over some meat off of the assistant director.

MAYOR
My God what a harrowing tale of human
drama this is! All of us doing what
we must to survive.

JIMBO
It is amazing what people can do
under stress. Just look at the
pyramids nobody knows how they built
those. Or who.

NARRATOR
Who built the pyramids? Was it the
Babylonians? Officer Barbrady?
Samaritans?

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Everyone is gathered around Mephesto's bed. The power appears
to still be draining, as the lights dim, and electrical sounds
wurr down...

EXT. BACK UP GENERATOR

KENNY
(On his walkie)
Mmmph mmm mph.

INT. HOSPITAL

DOCTOR
Roger Team B. He's reached the backup
generator. Team B can you see the
two copper nodes?

EXT. BACK UP GENERATOR

KENNY
(On his walkie)
Mmmph mmm mph.

INT. HOSPITAL

DOCTOR
Good, now is there a wire connecting
them?

EXT. BACK UP GENERATOR

KENNY
Mmm npm.

INT. HOSPITAL

DOCTOR
Damn. The wire connecting the nodes
is gone. We need to complete the
circuit between them or we're screwed.

KYLE
Do you have any wire here?

DOCTOR
There's no time. Once these lights
flicker out. All the patients on
life support are going to die.

EXT. BACK UP GENERATOR

KENNY
Mrmp mmme mrph.

INT. HOSPITAL

DOCTOR
No Kenny you can't. There must be
some other way. He's going to make
the connection himself with his hands.

KYLE
No, he'll die!

CARTMAN
Go Kenny.

DOCTOR
Kenny... Nooooooo......

EXT. BACK UP GENERATOR

Kenny connects the lines with his hands and we see him light
up like a Christmas tree.

INT. HOSPITAL

STAN
Oh my God they've killed Kenny!

KYLE
You bastards!

Suddenly the power comes on!!!

CHEF
The power!!

DOCTOR
Quickly, get the scanner running
again!!

Everybody converges on Mephesto.

DOCTOR
We've got a chance, now!!

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ESTABLISHING

INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM

PRESIDENT
Well okay Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize
fortieth trimester abortions for
you.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh thank you, thank you.

PRESIDENT
We'll have the pregnancy terminated
immediately.

MS. CARTMAN
Terminated?

PRESIDENT
Oh yes, that's what an abortion is.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh no, I didn't mean that. I meant
the other thing you can do. What's
that other "A" word?

PRESIDENT
Adoption?

MS. CARTMAN
Yes, that's what I mean. Adoption.

PRESIDENT
Well that's pretty different.

MS. CARTMAN
Oh I should just tell my son the
truth about everything myself. Good
day Mr. President.

EXT. SOUTH PARK

The sun begins to rise.

All over South Park, we see snow slowly melting as the sun's
rays drift over the land.

A few birds come out and start singing as the light shows us
the town of South Park, half buried in snow.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Mephesto's room, now lit by sunlight seems much more pleasant.

DOCTOR
Well, we made it. The power is on,
the snow is melting and your friend
Mephesto is doing fine.

Just then, Mephesto blinks his eyes open.

MEPHESTO
Where... Where am I?

CHEF
You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto.
You were shot. Now we don't know who
tried to shoot you, but --

MEPHESTO
Oh, I'm sure it was my brother again.
He tries to shoot me every month.

CHEF
Oh.

DOCTOR
Where is the little fat boy? He'll
be delighted that Mephesto is awake.

CHEF
He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Cartman, Stan and Kyle are on their knees in the snow.

STAN
He was a good friend, and I'll miss
him.

KYLE
He was very brave... He risked his
life so that Mephesto could live.

CARTMAN
Yeah, and now he's a freezie-pop.

Now we see that Kenny is standing in front of the boys, frozen
like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

STAN
Dude, do you think if we hit him
with a shovel he'd shatter?

KYLE
I dunno, let's find out.

EXT. AMERICA'S MOST WANTED HEADQUARTERS

A shovel appears through the snow. Jimbo squeezes his way
out and takes a deep breath of the crisp, morning air.

One by one, the townspeople all step out of the building and
look up at the warm sun.

MR. GARRISON
Oh, it's over... We're free!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes. But at what cost, Mr. Garrison?
At what cost?

A guilty hush falls over everyone.

JIMBO
Listen everybody, we did what we had
to in there.

MAYOR
But... How will we live with ourselves
now?

NED
One day at a time, Mayor... One day
at a time.

The camera PULLS BACK up and over the snow capped mountains
as Aaron Neville sings 'Ave Maria'

AARON NEVILLE
Aaaa... Ve Mariiiiii-aaaaa...

MR. GARRISON
Well, I'm bringing home some Eric
Roberts in a doggie bag, does anybody
else want some?

FADE OUT:

EPILOGUE

INT. HELL'S PASS HOSPITAL - DAY

Everyone is gathered in Mephesto's room much like they were
in the very first scene.

MEPHESTO
I'm glad you all could come... I can
finally reveal who the father of
Eric Cartman is... But first, I want
to thank Kenny McCormick for
sacrificing his life...

CARTMAN
JUST TELL US ALREADY!!!

MEPHESTO
Alright, Alright, Alright. The father
of Eric Cartman is... Say did anybody
see that Terrance & Phillip special
last month? Wasn't that just the
funniest thing ever?

CARTMAN
Goddamnit! Tell me who my father is!

Everyone looks around nervously.

MEPHESTO
Alright, as I said before, the father
is somebody in this room... The father
is --

Cartman's eyes grow wide.

MEPHESTO
MRS. CARTMAN!!!!

HUGE STING - Everybody gasps, then looks confused.

CHEF
What?!

MS. CARTMAN
Yes... It's true.

MR. GARRISON
No, that doesn't make sense.

MEPHESTO
Yes, it took quite a while for me to
understand as well. You see, Mrs.
Cartman is a hermaphrodite.

MR. GARRISON
Meaning what?

MEPHESTO
Meaning that she has both male and
female genitals.

MS. CARTMAN
It's true.

Everybody looks sick. Cartman's head is reeling.

CHEF
You mean that at the drunken barn
dance... When we all got together
with her she was a HE?

MEPHESTO
No, no, not exactly, but she did
have a penis.

Everybody in the room throws up.

MEPHESTO
The fact of the matter is,
hermaphrodites cannot bear children,
so Ms. Cartman's DNA match with Eric
can only mean that SHE is his father.
And she got another woman pregnant
at the drunken barn dance.

CARTMAN
Oh man this is fuckin' weak!!

STAN
DUDE, you're a big fat ass, AND your
mom's a hermaphlight!!

MS. CARTMAN
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric. I
just thought maybe it would be a
little shocking to you.

CARTMAN
(Sarcastic)
Oh wow, gee wiz you think so Ma?!

MEPHESTO
Well, that's that. Thank you all for
playing.

Everybody starts walking away, dazed.

CARTMAN
No No! Wait a minute! If she's my
dad, then who's my mom?

Pause...

NARRATOR
Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it --
Ms. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The
Mayor?

CARTMAN
OH FORGET IT!!

"TOILET PAPER"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. A new classroom. As the camera follows
a new teacher around, the following kids are seen working with
clay. Clyde presses the pottery wheel pedal as Bebe molds a vase
on the wheel. Wendy watches. Tweek, Red, and Pip work on clay
on the table near the wall. In the foreground, Token presses
the pottery wheel pedal as Jordan molds a vase. Butters, Kevin,
and another kid work on their own projects. Kenny, Stan, Kyle
and Cartman are laughing at their project, which didn't require
the use of the pottery wheel.]

TEACHER
Okay. Good, children, good. Remember
to feel the clay. Be one with the clay.
Nice. Uh huh.

CARTMAN
Put more clay on the balls.

TEACHER
Boys!  What is that?

KYLE
A reindeer?

TEACHER
You know, I've had it! You four boys
never take art class seriously!

CARTMAN
What a crime.

TEACHER
You think art is not important?

STAN
Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.


BUTTERS
I love our class!

STAN
See?

TEACHER
Do you think this is funny?!  Do you
think this is funny, huh?!  Well, you
four can just spend your afternoon after
school here making new pottery!

CARTMAN
You can't do that!

TEACHER
I certainly can! I'm your teacher!


CARTMAN
You're an art teacher!

TEACHER
Make it two hours!

[Cut to after school. The art teacher sits at her desk watching
the boys work on a proper vase on the pottery wheel. Kyle is
pressing the pedal. The boys are angry at their teacher]

STAN
Mrs. Dreible thinks she's so cool!


KYLE
How dare she talk to us like that?!


KENNY
(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)

CARTMAN
We can't let her get away with this!
I think tonight we need to do something
drastic.

STAN
Like what?

CARTMAN
Like find out where Mrs. Dreible lives,
and go over there, and... TP her house.


KENNY
(Yeah!)

KYLE
TP her house?

CARTMAN
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet
paper.

KYLE
Oh.

CARTMAN
What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken?
Ugh!

TEACHER
Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're
being punished!

STAN
Fine! But we'll have the last laugh
tonight, artwhore!

CARTMAN
Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!


[Henry's Supermarket, day. A man watches his son ride in a coin-operated
ride outside the store. Inside, the four boys approach checkout
line 3 with two carts stacked high with packages of Kush Tush
toilet paper.]

STAN
D'you think that's enough?

CARTMAN
Should be fine.

KYLE
Don't you guys think this is a little
suspicious? We should buy something
else so it doesn't look obvious.

CARTMAN
Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum.


CASHIER
Hello boys. Find everything you need?


CARTMAN
Yep. All set.

CASHIER
Mokay, let's see here. Toilet paper
Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Toilet
paper  Toilet paper  So, what are you
kids up to tonight?

CARTMAN
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV,
maybe play a board game.

CASHIER
Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet
paper  Toilet paper  Aaand toilet paper
Eh, hey.  Now you kids be careful with
this chewing gum.Don't go sticking it
under tables.

STAN
Okay.

CASHIER
Okay. Toilet paper  Toilet paper  Tooilet
paper  You know, son, I rmember you
comin' in last week and buying this
much toilet paper.

CARTMAN
Heh yeah, that that's right.

CASHIER
... Toilet paper  Toilet paper

KYLE
You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?


CARTMAN
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas
night.

KYLE
Oh.  Uuugh.

[Mrs. Dreible's house, later, that night. The boys walk up to
the house carrying black trash bags of toilet paper]

STAN
Is this the right house?

CARTMAN
It's the right address-wait! Look there!
There's Mrs. Dreible! This is the place.


KYLE
Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.


CARTMAN
So?

KYLE
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids
inside it!

STAN
Kyle, we all agreed to do this!

KYLE
We didn't say nothin' about no kids,
man!

CARTMAN
Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's
do this thing and get out of m'yeah.
Here's what I think of your art class,
you God-damned bitch!

KENNY
(Yeah! Fuck you!)

[Majestic music plays as Kenny unleashes his roll. Stan unleashes
a roll. Cartman tosses off another one and grins. More rolls
of paper fly onto the roof. Kyle tosses up a roll, unsure of
doing so. Stan unleashes another one, and his glee is unabashed.
Kenny tosses off another one. More and more rolls fly over the
roof. Kyle freezes in awe of their vandalism. Toilet paper covers
the house, the garage, and the trees around the house. The boys
head for the sidewalk]

CARTMAN
Come on, let's go!

KYLE
What have we done?

STAN
Let's go, Kyle!

[The bus stop]

KYLE
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo
much trouble.

CARTMAN
Aw man, that was sooo awesome!

KYLE
How can you say that? Did you see what
we did to their house?! It'll take them
days to clean that up!

CARTMAN
Who cares??

KYLE
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring
asshole, Cartman!

CARTMAN
Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands,
too, Kyle.

STAN
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in
this together.

[Kyle's house, after bedtime. Kyle's room. He is asleep, but
begins to have nightmares]

KYLE
Noo! No.  Noo!

MRS. DREIBLE
AAAAAAAAA!

MR. DREIBLE
Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our
house!

THE DREIBLE GIRLS
Mommy! Mommy!

MR. DREIBLE
Whyyy? Whyyy?

KYLE
Ah! Oh God! Oh God!

[South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their regular
classroom chatting, waiting for class to begin.]

BUTTERS
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened
last night? Mrs. Dreible's house got
covered with toilet paper.

CLYDE
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three
weeks to get it all down.

CARTMAN
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Dreible probably
had it comin' to her.

BUTTERS
I don't know. I don't think anybody
deserves that kind of brutality.

CARTMAN
Well, I understand the people who did
it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like
nobody will ever know the geniuses who
masterminded that perfect crime.


MR. GARRISON
Okay children, let's take our seats.
Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny,
the counselor wants to see you in his
office, now.

CARTMAN
Damn!

KYLE
Oh God!

[Outside the counselor's office. The boys sit on chairs next
to the door - the bench is gone. Kyle looks around nervously]


KYLE
How the hell did they find out it was
us that TP'ed that house?

CARTMAN
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing
on us! As long as we all stick to our
story, we'll be fine.

STAN
We'd better go over our story again
so we don't screw it up.

CARTMAN
Okay. Last night, all four of us were
at the bowling alley until about 7:30,
at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy,
the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club,
was bowling in the lane next to us,
and we asked her for her autograph,
but she didn't have a pen, so we followed
her out to her car, but on the way we
were accosted by five Scientologists
who wanted to give us all personality
tests, which were administered at the
Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45,
at which time we accidentally boarded
the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho
de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock,
and finally got a ride home with a man
who was missing his left index finger,
named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at
11:46.

KYLE
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that
personality test?

STAN
Yes, dude!

CARTMAN
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed
Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the
way we were accosted by five Scientologists
who wanted to give us all personality
tests, which were administered at the
Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45,
at which time we accidentally boarded
the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho
de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock,
and finally got a ride home with a man
who was missing his left index finger,
named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at
11:46, you got it??

KYLE
Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...

CARTMAN
Oh, for Christ's sake!

STAN
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all
the talking, okay? He's better at being
in trouble than anybody.

CARTMAN
Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come,
here they come.  "And so I said, 'That's
a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another
one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you
ready to see us now?

COUNSELOR MACKEY
We're gonna talk to you one at a time,
boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into
my office, please?

KENNY
(Me??)

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k?

CARTMAN
Touché, Mr. Mackey, touché.

KYLE
Why are they doing us one at a time?


CARTMAN
They want to see if we mix the story
up, and see if someone will rat out
the other three for a better deal.


KYLE
I can get a better deal?

CARTMAN
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us
out on this one, I will fucking kill
you!

[The Dreible house. Mr. Dreible is removing the toilet paper
from the trees and house with a broom. He's already filled two
trash bags of toilet paper and is filling a third.]

MR. DREIBLE
There we go. That should be about the
last of it.  Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what
are you doing?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Crime scene investigation!  There are
several footprints in the snow. Perhaps
more than one perpetrator?

MR. DREIBLE
Ah... look, we really don't wanna make
a big deal out of this.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Is that the toilet paper there? I'll
need to take those bags as evidence.


MR. DREIBLE
Lo-ih ih it's just not that big a deal,
I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself
when I was a kid.

OFFICER BARBRADY
You?! So where were you last night at
around 9?!

MR. DREIBLE
I was here.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Aha!! Got you!

MR. DREIBLE
Officer, why would I TP my own house?


OFFICER BARBRADY
Insurance?

MR. DREIBLE
It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't
mind, I just wanna get my yard back
to normal.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed
your house is still out there roaming
the streets. It's only a matter of time
before another house and another family
is victimized! I have to stop that from
happening.

MR. DREIBLE
You really have nothing better to do,
do you?

OFFICER BARBRADY
No I do not.

[Kyle's house, after bedtime. Kyle's room. He is asleep, but
the nightmares return]

KYLE
Noo! No.  Noo!

MRS. DREIBLE
AAAAAAAAA!

MR. DREIBLE
Oh, Jesus no! Our house!

THE DREIBLE GIRLS
Mommy! Mommy!

NANCY KERRIGAN
Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?

KYLE
Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the
truth!  Mooooomm!

CARTMAN
Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?

KYLE
I was... I was just going to get a drink
of water.

CARTMAN
No need. I have one for you right here.


KYLE
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

CARTMAN
Is there anything else I can get for
you?

KYLE
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to
bed now.

CARTMAN
You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.

[Park County Juvenile Hall, day. Inside, the warden leads Officer
Barbrady to Cell Block 4.]

WARDEN
Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses
in less than a year.  He's a real monster.


OFFICER BARBRADY
I just need to talk to someonen who
knows how toilet paperers think.

WARDEN
Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you
in a second if he had the chance.  He's
the last cell on your left.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady.
I'm with the South Park police.

JOSH
That's a terrible cologne you're wearing,
officer. You should try something more...
casual.

OFFICER BARBRADY
I was hoping you could help me solve
a toilet-papering case?

JOSH
And why would I do that? Because I'm
such a charming fella?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh please, I need your help. What would
you want in return?

JOSH
Due to the harsh nature of my crimes
they don't allow me to have toilet paper
in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome
that becomes.

OFFICER BARBRADY
You... know I can't give you toilet
paper, Josh.

JOSH
Nno, but it was worth a try, doesn't
it?  Tell me something, officer: why
is it that you police such a small town.
You must have had larger inspirations.
What happened to those... big-city dreams?


OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, that's kind of personal.

JOSH
Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what
I want to know. And I'll help you catch
whoever toilet-papered that house.


OFFICER BARBRADY
Look kid, I have very little time to
catch whoever toilet-papered that house.
Tell me what you know.

JOSH
Are those the crime scene photos? Let
me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work,
not bad at all. These toilet-paperers
are professional, at least one of them
is.

OFFICER BARBRADY
So you think there was more than one.
Why?

JOSH
Tell me something first. When you went
to the academy you had something to
prove. You wanted to protect and serve,
but mostly you wanted to protect yourself.
Who were you protecting yourself from,
Officer Barbrady?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles
used to hit me with a belt!

JOSH
Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are
most like males between the ages of
8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents
notice that much toilet paper missing,
so they would have to have bought it
themselves. Find out where the toilet
paper came from, officer, and you just
might catch your man.

[South Park Elementary, day. Kids are moving towards their classes,
passing each other in the process. Stan and Kenny are talking
with Clyde, Craig, and Kevin]

CARTMAN
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys
for a second?  I think we have the counselor
and the principal fooled, but we need
to talk about Kyle.

STAN
What about him?

CARTMAN
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's
gonna crack.

KENNY
(I think so too.)

CARTMAN
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna
sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna
take the fall for what we did.

BUTTERS
Ha-ey fellas.

STAN
Butters.

CARTMAN
Look you guys, all it takes is for
one of us to crack, and we all know
who the weakest link is!

STAN
So what should we do?

CARTMAN
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.


STAN
... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!


KENNY
(Yeah!)

CARTMAN
Why not?

STAN
Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?


CARTMAN
He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's
office! He can't even keep the story
straight! I'm telling you guys, he's
weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end
of all of us.

[South Park Police Department]

CASHIER
You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?


OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A
house was TP'ed in South Park and I
need to see if you can identify the
toilet paper I recovered from the scene.
I'm... sorry I have to do this.


MR. BELL
Oh my God.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Is this toilet paper from your store?


MR. BELL
It's... difficult to tell, it's... so
decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes,
I recognize the floral pattern now.


OFFICER BARBRADY
Positive ID on the toilet paper.


MR. BELL
Who would... do this to toilet paper?
Who?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious
buying toilet paper in the last few
days?

MR. BELL
Suspicious like how?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, like someone who was black or
Mexican or Middle Eastern.

MR. BELL
Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall
bought toasted tarts and chips and...
we don't allow Middle Eastern people
in the store.  Oh my God!

[Stark's Pond, night. A low fog moves over the surface of the
water]

KYLE
What's this all about, Cartman?

CARTMAN
I just wanted to see how you're doing,
Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little
boat ride?

KYLE
A boat ride?

CARTMAN
I just thought we should find a private
place to... talk.

KYLE
Well, okay.

CARTMAN
Could you help me put this cement block
and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's
go.  So how are things, Kyle?

KYLE
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes
I see the house we TP'ed. I see the
tears of our art teacher and hear the
screams of her daughters.

CARTMAN
And you feel like you have to confess.


KYLE
I don't know what to do.  Part of me
feels like I wanna end it all now.
Tell people what heppened. You know,
I never knew how beautiful this pond
was before.  So cold. The world can
feel like that.  So calm on the outside,
as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!


CARTMAN
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I
could only afford a Wiffle ball bat,
so it's gonna take a while.

KYLE
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take
longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.


KYLE
You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live
like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it!


CARTMAN
Won't be long, Kyle.

[Juvenile Hall, day. Barbrady returns to Cell Block 4]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Josh, I need your help.

JOSH
The answer is right in front of you,
but you can't see it.

OFFICER BARBRADY
How do you mean?

JOSH
Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?


OFFICER BARBRADY
Yes.

JOSH
Single-sheet?

OFFICER BARBRADY
No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell
you?

JOSH
Why does one toilet-paper houses

OFFICER BARBRADY
To get revenge.

JOSH
No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers
wanted to transform the art teacher's
house, thus transforming her entire
occupation.

OFFICER BARBRADY
What do you mean?

JOSH
Your uncle, who hit you with a belt.
Was he a large man?

OFFICER BARBRADY
I don't have time for this, kid.

JOSH
Did he stink like bayer when he came
home from work all powoor from playin'
down at the pool hiyouse?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Alright alright my dad dressed me up
like a little girl on poker nights and
he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!


JOSH
Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers
are most likely students in the art
teacher's class, students who aren't
very good at art.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Oh. Of course! One of her students!


JOSH
Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've
got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy.
Fly fly flyyy.

WARDEN
Josh,  were you doing the silly voice
for the policeman again?

JOSH
No, sir.

[Stark's pond, night. Cartman is still whacking away at Kyle,
in vain. Stan and Kenny come up in a pedal-powered boat. Both
of them are pedaling. Stan looks over]

STAN
Cartman, what are you doing?

CARTMAN
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle
will be dead in a matter of hours.


STAN
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The
police made an arrest. And the person
confessed!

CARTMAN
They did?

KYLE
They did?

STAN
They say they got the guy that did it
down at the police station.

KYLE
Who confessed? That doesn't make any
sense.

CARTMAN
But can I still kill Kyyyle?

[South Park Police Department, day. The boys head for the station
and enter]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Hello boys. How are you?

STAN
We heard that you have the person who
TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that
true?

OFFICER BARBRADY
It sure is!

CARTMAN
Uh, can we see them-him-her?

OFFICER BARBRADY
Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated
the suspect for over forty hours, and
he finally cracked.

BUTTERS
Hey fellas!

STAN
Butters?

BUTTERS
Yep. I'm in jail.

KYLE
You con-fessed?

BUTTERS
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art
teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember
it,  but they're pretty sure it was
me.  I just can't get my behavior under
control!

OFFICER BARBRADY
His parents are on their way down now.


BUTTERS
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let
me have it! Just wait till my father
gets here!

KYLE
You guys, we can't let him do this!


CARTMAN
What are you talking about? This is
a gift from God. An early Easter present
all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from
Jesus Christ himself!

BUTTERS
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what
I am. When God made me, he must have
not been payin' very close attention,
'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain
wrong!

KYLE
Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP
that house.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Why do you say that?

KYLE
Because it was-

CARTMAN
Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for
a nice game of Wiffle ball?

BUTTERS
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried
about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why,
she lives in Michigan. But when she
finds out about this, woooo smokey,
is she gonna be sore! She might even
break up with me. And it would serve
me right, too.

OFFICER BARBRADY
All right, boys, visiting time is over.
Thanks for stopping by.

[South Park Police Department, outside. The boys leave the station]


CARTMAN
You see guys, it all worked itself out.
Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel
a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how
you like me now?

KYLE
I still feel bad, Cartman

CARTMAN
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody
else is gonna pay for our crime.

KYLE
Yeah. That makes it even worse.

CARTMAN
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem
to understand. We're we're not gonna
get punished for this. Ever.

KYLE
I know.

CARTMAN
So... so then, how can you feel bad?


STAN
He feels guilty for doing it and for
letting someone else pay for it.

CARTMAN
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.


STAN
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble
of not, you can still feel bad.  I think
you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should
confess.

KENNY
(Yeah, maybe we should.)

CARTMAN
What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's
nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're
off scot-free!

KYLE
We feel bad for other people.

CARTMAN
For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih,
ih, is it that ...you think you might
get in trouble later?

STAN
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the
teacher it was us, and let her decide
what to do.  And Cartman, if you had
any thread of a conscience at all, you'll
do the same!

CARTMAN
Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos,
man!

[South Park Police Department. The Stotches arrive at the police
station and charge in]

CHRIS
Well well well! I had to see it to believe
it!

BUTTERS
Hi, Dad.

CHRIS
Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you!
Standing behind prison bars! Again!


BUTTERS
Yeahhh.

LINDA
What fibs have you been telling this
policeman, Butters?! You know damn well
you didn't toilet-paper that house!


OFFICER BARBRADY
Huh??

CHRIS
Butters was with us all night, Officer
Barbrady.

LINDA
Butters, what have we told you about
confessing to crimes you didn't commit?!
We have had it, mister!

BUTTERS
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours,
and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.


CHRIS
And that's your excuse?!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, looks like I made a mistake. I...
guess I'd better let you out now.


CHRIS
Just wait till we get you home, you
little fibber!

BUTTERS
Officer, can I stay in jail, please?


[The woods near Stark's Pond, evening. Eric appears and calls
out to people behind him]

CARTMAN
Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!


STAN
What is it, Cartmam?

CARTMAN
It's over this way! Come on!

[Stark's Pond, later. Cartman rows the small boat to the middle
of the lake, as he did before with Kyle. Lonely music plays,
as before]

CARTMAN
So how are things, guys?

STAN
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in
school, and that's final.

CARTMAN
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.


KYLE
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!


CARTMAN
Can't I?

[South Park Elementary, next day. Officer Barbrady enters the
principal's office.]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Excuse me, everyone.  I have someone
with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered
the art teacher's house!  Josh insisted
he be able to tell you the names of
the toilet paperers in person.

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but
we actually don't need to know-

KYLE
Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey,
Mrs. Dreible. We have something we need
to tell you.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
All right. Will you people stop barging
into my office, please?

JOSH
What's the matter, Principal Victoria?
Was your mother abusive? Did she spank
your thighs with cold cuts and stick
umbrellas up your ass?

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Get him out of here!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh
outside, please?

JOSH
Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made
officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown?


KYLE
We have to confess that we were the
ones that-

COUNSELOR MACKEY
It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already
know everything.

STAN
You, you do? How?

CARTMAN
Hi guys.

KYLE
Cartman??

CARTMAN
I told them everything, you guys. It's
over.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Luckily for us, one of you had enough
of a conscience to come forward.

CARTMAN
My consciences just caught up with me.


KYLE
That's not fair!

COUNSELOR MACKEY
You all get two weeks of detention,
except Eric, who gets one week for being
brave.

KYLE
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have
a conscience!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Well, I guess my work here is done.
After all this, I'm gonna need a long
vacation.

KYLE
This was supposed to be my story! My
coming to terms with a guilty conscience!
This isn't fair!

[South Park Elementary, hallway outside the principal's office]


OFFICER BARBRADY
Okay, Josh, time to go back to the...
Oh no!

POLICEMAN BROWN
He... He was too fast for me. He ran
out the door!

OFFICER BARBRADY
Couldn't you have gone after him?

POLICEMAN BROWN
Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper.
I'd look silly.

[South Park Elementary cafeteria, after school. Mr. Mackey addresses
the detained. The boys are there, as well as two of the sixth
graders, and Craig and Bebe]

COUNSELOR MACKEY
Welcome to detention. You will be here
till five o'clock, so make good study
use of your time. M'kay?

STAN
Wugh! Two weeks of this!

KYLE
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot
better now.

CARTMAN
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize
now that even though you might not get
caught doing something bad, you can
still get caught later.

KYLE
Oh Jesus!

CARTMAN
I didn't feel bad before, but now I
just feel terrible.

KYLE
You just feel bad for yourself that
you're in detention!

CARTMAN
Right. I guess I learned today that
sometimes you-

KYLE
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn
anything! Not a God-damned thing!


CARTMAN
Hm.

[South Park Police Department, afternoon. Barbrady stands at
his desk. The phone rings and he answers it.]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Police station.

JOSH
Hello Officer Barbrady.

OFFICER BARBRADY
Josh? Josh, where are you?!

[An undisclosed location, day]

JOSH
I'm afraid that giving away my location
might be harmful to my freedom, officer.
I just wanted to thank you for helping
me get out of that dingy cell.

[South Park Police Department]

OFFICER BARBRADY
Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile
Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.


[the undisclosed location, day]

JOSH
Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something
I've been meaning to do for quite some
time. Ciao.

"WING"


Written by


Trey Parker





[South Park Elementary, day. Class is in session. The kids are
chattering when Mrs. Garrison gets their attention]

MRS. GARRISON
Children, children, we have a very special
announcement.  Your classmate, Token,
has just returned from winning the Colorado
Child Star Contest with his incredible
singing! Well let's give him a hand!


STAN
Token sings?

CARTMAN
Of course he sings. He's black.

MRS. GARRISON
Token is going to sing in front of a
huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant
in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna
be paid two hundred dollars.

CLASS
Whoa!

STAN
Two hundred dollars.

MRS. GARRISON
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit
against those chauvinistic pageants,
but I hope that you children take a
moment today to congratulate Token for
being so special.

[South Park Elementary, lunchtime. Stan and friends sit at a
table just outside the school kitchen. They're deep in thought]


STAN
Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?


KYLE
How come we never get opportunities
like that?

CARTMAN
You wanna know what it is, guys?

KYLE
We're not talented?

CARTMAN
That's right. We're not talented. See,
we're not the artistic side, we're the
thinking side.

STAN
Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.


CARTMAN
Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing
idea. Token is going right to the top,
right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge
star.

KYLE
Probably.

CARTMAN
So, why shouldn't we get some of that
money? We can be Token's agents. That
way, we get ten percent of whatever
he makes!

STAN
Hey yeah! We deserve that money just
as much as he does.

CARTMAN
We just need a really kickass office
and some nice suits. A and a fountain
in our lobby. All top agencies have
fountains in their lobbies. We gotta
make Token think he needs us, when actually
he doesn't need us at all.

[MONTAGE
Cartman tries out his suit in front
of a full-length mirror in his room.
Stan and Kyle try out suits in Kyle's
room. Next, the boys are in a department
store purchasing cell phones at Bull's
Eye. Next, Stan and Kyle carry an executive
desk into the new office. Next, Cartman
and Kenny steal a fountain from somebody's
backyard. Next, flyers for the new agency,
Super Awesome Talent Agency, are printed
out. Next, the boys are at a copy center
to get some business cards. Next, Cartman
and Kyle set up signs around town. Next,
the finished office is shown... in Cartman's
basement. The four boys congratulate
each other for a job well donw.]

[South Park, day. Token walks by one of the signs the boys drew
up. He notices it and stops to read it. The boys hide around
the corner. Stan peaks around the corner.]

STAN
He's looking at the sign.

CARTMAN
Perfect! All right, you guys get back
to the office, I'll bring Token there.


STAN
All right.

CARTMAN
Wait a minute! You guys, this is very
important: when I bring Token back to
the office, have Kenny hide in another
room, and call the phone on my desk.


KYLE
Why?

CARTMAN
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm
talking to somebody super famous and
important. When Token sees that, maybe
he'll think we're legit.

STAN
It's genius.

CARTMAN
Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah?
Well then tell him we're just not interested.
Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what
is up?!

TOKEN
Nothin'

CARTMAN
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing
some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.


TOKEN
Yeah.

CARTMAN
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you
this before, but I'm actually an agent
over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.
You may have seen our ads around town.
Anyway, why don't you come down to the
office, Token? Maybe I can convince
the company to represent you.

TOKEN
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.

CARTMAN
This will only take a second.

[Cartman's basement - er, Super Awesome Talent Agency. Cartman
takes Token down the stairs and onto the agency floor]

CARTMAN
Welcome to our offices, Token. As you
can see, we are quite a successful company.
Did you notice the fountain? Pretty
nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.
Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking
about becoming a client.

STAN
Oohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin'
a smart move, man.

CARTMAN
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying
to yourself: You're saying, "Hey, why
do I need an agency? Why should I give
them ten percent?" Right?

TOKEN
...Yeah?

CARTMAN
Token, the truth is that without representation,
you in danger of being taken advantage
of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second,
Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham
Lincoln?  Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy
you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just
sort of in the middle of something right
now.

KYLE
Can I talk to you?!

CARTMAN
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.

KYLE
What the hell are you doing?!

CARTMAN
I'm making it look like important people
call us.

KYLE
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two
hundred years!

CARTMAN
...well Token doesn't know that.

KYLE
Yes he does!

CARTMAN
How?!

KYLE
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!

CARTMAN
Jew!

STAN
You guys, we're gonna lose our client.


CARTMAN
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea,
guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call
about that.  Ah, now, where were we?


TOKEN
We were at why I should give you ten
percent.

STAN
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.
You're gonna start having a lot of offers
comin' at you from all directions. A
media storm is about to hit you and
you can't handle it on your own. Nobody
can.

KYLE
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents. You need somebody
to manage it all for you.

STAN
This thing in Denver is is just the
crust, Token. With our support, you
can have the whole pie.

TOKEN
Well, I guess that makes sense. All
right.

CARTMAN
Uh if... we could just get you to sign
right here?

KYLE
Welcome to the team, Token.

STAN
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!


KENNY
(Hey, terrific!)

CARTMAN
From now on, we are an entertainment
team, Token. You just do all the singing,
all the performing and all the entertaining,and
leave the rest to us.

[Denver Convention Center, night. The Miss Colorado Pageant is
underway]

MC
And there are your finalists, the sixteen
most beautiful women in Colorado. Here
to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists,
the winner of the Colorado Child Star
Contest, Token Black.

TOKEN
You'll never find...

As long as you live...

Someone who loves you...

Tender like I do...

MAN
Wow, he's really great. We should get
him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah


STAN
Oh, you're interested in hiring our
client?

CARTMAN
We represent Token.  Give us a call,
we'll work out a deal.

TOKEN
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby


But I'm the one who loves you

And there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else.

MRS. GARRISON
Just between us girls, nothin' gets
my vadge wetter than a black man singing.


PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.


TOKEN
... (you're gonna miss my lovin')

I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')


You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove.

[Denver Convention Center, after the show, outside. The boys
walk out with Token, who's counting the cash he earned.]

STAN
You were awesome, Token!

KYLE
We knew you could do it!

CARTMAN
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!
And ten percent of two hundred is...


KYLE
Twenty dollars.

TOKEN
Here you go.

KENNY
(All right!)

CARTMAN
Sweet!

STAN
This is just the beginning. I bet we
start to see all kinds of offers comin'
in for Token now.

AGENT
Hey there my man, that was a great
performance.

TOKEN
Thanks.

AGENT
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in
Los Angeles. I think you've got real
promise. How'd you like to sign with
CAA?

TOKEN
Are you serious??

STAN
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.


CARTMAN
You may have heard of Super Awesome
Talent Agency.

DON
Mm, no. Uh, look, Token, there's some
shows in LA we wanna book you on right
away. If you come out to my limo we
can talk everything through.

TOKEN
Oh my God! Okay!

CARTMAN
Token, you signed with us!

TOKEN
Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what
a huge opportunity this is for me.


CARTMAN
What?! Uh they're not so great! They
probably don't have a fountain in their
lobby!

DON
Actually, our fountain is two stories
tall.

CARTMAN
...Oooo...

DON
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk
about.

KYLE
Mister, you can't do this to us!

DON
Sorry kids, nature of the business,
you know?  Do you like steak, Token?
I know a great place for you locally.


CARTMAN
...Goddamnit!

[Super Awesome Talent Agency, day. The boys sit around a table
trying to come up with other ways of attracting potential clients.
Kenny relaxes on the sofa]

STAN
So unfair... so unfair.

KYLE
All that time and effort we spent helping
Token and this is the thanks we get?!


CARTMAN
This just goes to show that hard work
doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless
addict from now on!

MR. KIM
Ahh hello, is this the Talent Agency


STAN
Huh?

MR. KIM
I see this sign on the street for a
talent agency? I need a representation.
Hey, wowee, nice fountain.

STAN
You were looking for a talent agent?


MR. KIM
No, not me, my wife.  This is Wing.
She just come over from China.  She
over here uh irregarry. The Chinese
Mafia help me out.

STAN
And what does she do?

MR. KIM
Ah, she sing. She very popular in China.
Hey, you just sit and listen. You'll
be very impressed.  Well? What you think?


STAN
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her
career off the ground would take too
much work for us.

MR. KIM
Aww, that's too bad. She just got accepted
to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres,
but I can't take her 'cause I have to
mind the restaurant.

CARTMAN
You've ...already done all the work?


MR. KIM
Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowrar.


KYLE
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.


STAN
Yeah!

MR. KIM
Rearry?

CARTMAN
We'll go to LA with your wife. All she
has to do is go on the show, do all
the performing, make all the money,
and leave the rest to us.

[City Wok, night. The phone rings.]

MR. KIM

[City Wok, night. The phone rings.]

STAN
Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents.

MR. KIM

TONG LEADER
It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your

MR. KIM

[Hollywood, day. A view of the Hollywood sign from a location
above a main thoroughfare]

[A major studio. The boys walk among the various studios - Studio
21, Studio 22, Studio 23...]

STAN
There it is! American Idol constestants!


KYLE
Jesus, we made it just in time!

CARTMAN
Excuse us!

CONTESTANT
Hey kid, what do you think you're doing?


STAN
Ah our client has an audition to this
show.

CONTESTANT
Yeah. So do we!

KYLE
Oh crap!

CARTMAN
Dude, how long is the wait?

CONTESTANT 2
It's been about seventeen days for me.


STAN
Oh no, nonono, come on!  Excuse me,
ma'am.

ATTENDANT
Wait in line with everyone else.

STAN
No, I don't think you understand. We're
here with Wing. That's right, the Wing.


KYLE
Ma'am, we are a very important talent
agency. If your producers knew you were
forcing people of our stature to the
back of the line, well-

CARTMAN
Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me,
everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello?
Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm
doing great, but you know, heh, someone
at American Idol doesn't know who Wing
is.

KYLE
Aw, just forget it!

CARTMAN
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders!
You shouldn't give her any more chicken.


KYLE
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!

STAN
We can't wait in line! We have to be
in school on Monday!

CARTMAN
Stupid assholes!

AGENT
What do you mean your client isn't coming?!
We're taping the show tomorrow! Where

Fine! Go screw yourself!

KYLE
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you

STAN
We have someone who's ready to go on
TV right away!

AGENT
Really?

CARTMAN
Is there a cash prize involved in your
show as well?

AGENT
Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars.


STAN
All right, our client will do it!

AGENT
Great! You kids just saved my ass! See
you over at Stage 6.

KYLE
Hey, is your show as good as America
Idol?

AGENT
Naw, this is better. It's called The
Contender.

STAN
What's "The Contender"?

[The Contender commercial]

ANNOUNCER
Tonight, two people will compete for
glory. One will stay, one will go home,
in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.


STALLONE
Hello.

ANNOUNCER
The Contender!

[The Contender taping]

ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The
Contender! Fighting out of the red corner,
wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor
from Del Fuego, Mexico, Manuelo Furrrrnanda!


STALLONE
Le's go! Le's see a good fight!

ANNOUNCER
And fighting out of the blue corner,
wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk
dress, Wing!

CARTMAN
Come on, Wing!

KYLE
Let's do it Wing!

STAN
Brint it on Wing!

STALLONE
Aw yeah!

THE BOYS
Awww!

KYLE
Oh my God, dude!

CARTMAN
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll
give her that.

THE BOYS
Awww!

CARTMAN
Gay.

[Stage 6, day. The boys stand outside the stage with cups in
their hands]

STAN
Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese
woman get back to Colorado?

CARTMAN
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.


STALLONE
Hey kid!

PRODUCER
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't
go better for you back there.

STAN
Oh, thanks.

STALLONE
Yo kid.

PRODUCER
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has
a lot of talent.  He really likes her
voice.  You know, the way she vocalizes
the melody,  it brings tears to his
eyes.

CARTMAN
Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry
she wasn't a better boxer.

PRODUCER
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing
at his son's wedding.

STAN
You do??

PRODUCER
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.


CARTMAN
Four thousand dollars??

PRODUCER
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m.
sharp. And don't be late.

STAN
We won't!

STAN, CARTMAN
Waaaaah!

STAN
You guys, you guys!

KYLE
What?

STAN
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing
at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's
gonna pay her four thousand dollars!


KENNY
(What?!)

KYLE
Get out!

CARTMAN
That's four hundred for us! We did it!


KYLE
Woohoo! Yeah!

STAN
Yeah!

CARTMAN
Who let the dogs out?

THE BOYS
Who? Who? Who who?

CARTMAN
Who let the dogs out?

THE BOYS
Who? Who? Who who?

CARTMAN
Who let-?

STAN
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?


KYLE
What do you mean? We thought she was
with you.

CARTMAN
Naw, sh-she was with you!

STAN
...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA
talent agency finds out she has work,
they're gonna try to steal her away
from us again.

CARTMAN
Wing? Wing??

KYLE
Wing?

CARTMAN
Wing? Here, Wing!

KYLE
Wing?

KENNY
(Wing?)

TONG LEADER
You thought you could run from us, did
you?

STAN
Oh no!  Hey! That's our client!

KYLE
They did it to us again! That dirty
talent agency stole our client again!


CARTMAN
Not this time! They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency
is! We're gonna march in there, and
get our client back.

[A crisp clear night under a bright moon. The camera pans down
and rests on a hilltop mansion]

TONG LEADER
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a
deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak
into the U.S., but when they get here,
they become our slaves. It's an age-old
business, and nobody has the guts to
stop us.

STAN
Two four nine all right, this is the
place.

KYLE
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.

CARTMAN
Of course it's impressive! They steal
everyone else's clients!

GUARD 1
"It's just four little boys"

CARTMAN
Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.


[The mansion, inside. The boys walk through a long, lavish hallway]


STAN
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right
now!

CARTMAN
Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do
have an amazing fountain.

KYLE
You assholes stole our client! How about
some Goddamn business ethics?!

STAN
You tell 'em, Kyle!

KYLE
You think you own the entertainment
business, but you don't! Give us back
Wing, RIGHT NOW!

STAN
Jesus, they really want Wing as their
client!

TONG LEADER
What the hell is that?! Go! Go!

KYLE
Dude, maybe we should give up!

STAN
No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting
CAA take all our clients, we're never
gonna make it as talent agents!

CARTMAN
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play
rouch, we can play rought too!

KYLE
Cartman!

CARTMAN
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take
this!

STAN
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!

KYLE
Wing??

[Two guards fire away. Kyle and Kenny duck and cover themselves,
and two guards coming up behind them are killed. Cartman and
Stan go down a hallway, with Cartman firing at everything in
sight. Two guards follow them and fire away. Kyle finds shelter
behind a red sofa tattered from the gunfire, but Kenny isn't
with him]

KYLE
Stupid talent agents!

[Kyle looks up from behind the sofa and throws the car towards
the gunmen. One of them slips on it and flies out a window, the
other slips on it and falls back onto the mansion's fuse box.
He gets electrocuted]

KYLE
All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?
Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't
die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing
back as our client and... and make a
ton of money! I swear it to you!

[Kyle hugs Kenny again. Cartman and Stan enter the room where
Wing is being held. Cartman again opens fire and three guards
fire back. Kyle enters the room with his own gun and fires at
the guards]

KYLE
They killed Kenny!

STAN
You bastards!

TONG LEADER
Enough!  I have a lot of respect for
you boys finding your way in here. But
you come any closer and I'll blow her
brains out.

CARTMAN
Don't give us that crap! She's no good
to you dead and you know it!

STAN
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause
then she can't pay you money! We know
because we're in the same business you
are!

TONG LEADER
This woman has a contract with us! We
own her!

KYLE
She had a contract with us first! We
own her!

TONG LEADER
Her life belongs to us!

KYLE
Her life belongs to us!

STAN
Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what
we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking
about an object here, we're, we're talking
about a person. I mean, look at what
we've all become. All this violence
and anger and, and for what? For control
over somebody's life who... w-we're
all just trying to leech off of.

KYLE
Yeah.

STAN
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business
that treats people like commodities.


TONG LEADER
Perhaps... you're right. We spend all
this time... mooching off the hopes
and dreams of others, forgetting that
they are human beings.

KYLE
Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.


TONG LEADER
I am tired of this business. It is
a very dirty and perverse business.


STAN
It's a lousy business. I quit.

KYLE
Me too.

CARTMAN
Aw aw guys, come on!

TONG LEADER
We quit too.  It's time for us to find
another way to make money. From now
on, all contracts we have on people
are null and void.

STAN, KYLE
All right!

[Stallone's mansion, next day. He gets on stage to ...um, mumble]


PRODUCER
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for
coming to his son's wedding. And now
as a special treat, it is his pleasure
to give you the music of... Wing!


WING
Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to
last your whole life long...

MR. KIM
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.

TONG LEADER
Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice
is so beautiful.  To think we would
have made it so nobody would ever hear
her sing.

STAN
I think we all learned it's best to
leave talent to the talented people.


TOKEN
Send a cress in your plates, folks?


KYLE
Token?

TOKEN
Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you
doin' here?

CARTMAN
Token, you're... waiting tables?

TOKEN
Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't
really do anything for you.  I'm trying
to work my way back home.

CARTMAN
Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey,
could you bring us some more bread,
huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop
chop!

TONG LEADER
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!


MR. KIM
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.


WING
Sing, sing a song.

THE END
