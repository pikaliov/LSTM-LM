[Scene: Monica and Chandler's Apartment, Monica sits at the table 
  reading the mail]
  
  Monica: Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but 
  you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?! (shocked) 
  I was in the house! 
  
  Ross: (entering) Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention 
  that…
  
  Monica: … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. 
  
  Ross: I see. You didn't happen to tell…
  
  Monica: … everybody we know? Yeah.
  
  Ross: Great. Thanks! (He leaves)
